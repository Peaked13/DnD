-Assassin and Fiend archetypes
-Pact of the Blade is all kinds of good for sneaking weapons into places
	-It's invocations would be great if you get that far in Warlock, but that's not clear
-Other pacts aren't bad either
	-Tome to get Guidance is particularly good for rogue skills, and the ritual invocation is also nice
-Invocations:
	-Devil's Sight is amazing for getting sneak attacks
	-Beguiling Influence gives good rogue skill proficiencies, if you need more than the 4 rogue gives you
	-Mask of Many Faces would be a good option if you *don't* need the extra skills
	-Similarly, Beast Speech also has interesting, if situational, possibilities
	-The Blade Pact invocations are amazing, but all higher level
-Race:
	-Human is likely the way to go
		-Particularly variant human
	-Tiefling has somewhat useful ability bonuses, and an extra casting of Darkness per day
