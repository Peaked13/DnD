My Aarokocra fighter, known as Arreeek *chirp* Aur *whistle* Oor, is from The Elemental Plain of Air, as most of his people are. By the time he came of age, at three years old, he was already a renowned warrior.

Shortly after reaching adulthood, the young shaman of his tribe proposed to him that he undergo a ritual, to teach him to be a truly great warrior. While he wasn't all that sure how stuff like "humility" would make him a great warrior, it was his dream to become one of the greatest warriors of his people, a legend told for many generations, so he figured he'd give it a shot.

After drinking the shaman's sacred brew, he hallucinated vividly, vomited quite a lot, and passed out. When he awoke, he found himself on this strange plane (if I recall what Jake said, Ravenloft). Reasoning that this was clearly a test of his abilities, he immediately set about hunting and slaying fearsome creatures, seeking the conquest that would prove his valor and ferocity to his tribe. In particular, he favors the ancient enemy of his people, gargoyles, which seem to be plentiful here.

Having spent almost three years now on this plane, nearly his entire adult life, he has grown wiser and has begun to doubt that conclusion. He _did_ bully the future shaman rather a lot after all, when they were both fledglings.

Fortunately, he has discovered a faith that cares quite a bit less about humility than the spirits that the shaman was always droning on about, and has given himself to Tempus. In The Lord of Battle, he has found a god that appreciates him for who he is, and the path to becoming a truly great warrior.
