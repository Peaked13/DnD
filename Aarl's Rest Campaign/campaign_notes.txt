-Chapel
	-Description of chapel:
		As you approach the chapel, you can see the chapel is a small, relatively recently built wooden structure. Around it's door are carved the symbols of the Imperial Pantheon.
		Inside, the building is one large, stone floored room, around which are arranged idols representing the various gods of the pantheon. It's centered on a statue of Martinus, founder of The Empire. At his right hand is the idol of Valerius.
	-Run by Nebel, a priest of the Imperial Godhead
		-Description:
			Sweeping in one corner of the building is a man, in late middle age, in the robes of a priest of The Imperial Godhead.
		-To Jake: "I'm the only priest of the Imperial Faith in this little town. I celebrate the feasts and holidays of each of the gods, but you'd be welcome to hold services in the chapel for Valerius."
			  "Beyond that, from time to time people come to the chapel for somewhat more direct help. If you'd be willing to spend some time in the chapel, and provide such aid and healing too, I'd certainly welcome that."
