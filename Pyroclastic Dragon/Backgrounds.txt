-Dragon: Sszythrach, implacable and furious.
	-Sszythrach is meant to be a long hissing pair of syllables followed by a harsh roar / 
	 throat clearing noise, representing volcanic simmering followed by sudden fury, and
	 threatening his terrifying breath weapon.
	-His epitaph: "He before whom foes crumble."
		-Disintegrate and morale both.
	-Sszythrach is drenched in honor culture, with a rather fuedal outlook.
		-"The strong naturally rule the weak, and you'd do well to know your place in the
		 chain."
		-Good dose of divine right of kings too, thoroughly reinforced by the fact that the
		 divinely ordained draconic kings clearly _are_ born different.
			-"If you were meant to rule, you too would have been born winged and bescaled."
		-He's deeply concerned with status and reputation, particularly among his kin.
			-Given his youth, he's looking to make a name for himself, and that's likely
			 his main motivation to leave his well-loved home of Gehenna.
		-Since the denizens of his home are all quite selfish and larceneous, a fearsome
		 reputation is an important asset for any pyroclastic dragon looking to hold onto
		 their horde.
	-Sszythrach may also be well suited to his task from the planar council in ways they're
	 not going to mention to his face.
		-Sounds like he's being sent to investigate something.
		-Sszythrach is pretty straightforward for a dragon, and has something of the nature
		 of a metaphorical bulldog. He wants to know what's in it for him, but he's unlikely
		 to concoct especially deceitful schemes in the course of the investigation and,
		 should he make enemies during it, he's likely to pursue them to their or his
		 destruction, rendering him highly motivated.


-Cohort: His thrall Arvaec, God-Slave of Tiamat.
	-Overview first sent to Lesley:
		-I'm envisioning this elf as having been the young elf offered up in sacrifice
		 every century to the dragon that threatened or ruled his homeland, in turn made
		 the slave-priest of the god-dragon-tyrant Tiamat, to fulfill that dragon's own
		 obligations, eventually finding himself the retainer of my own dragon as he is
		 sent to investigate the "god stuff" you mentioned.
	-Arvaec is a combination of Draconic word for elf, "vaecaesin", and one of the
	 language's possesive prefixes. Basically a short form of "my elf".
		-At least as the Draconomicon's language samples had it.
		-"You may call me Arvaec." then becomes a somewhat smooth way he introduces
		 himself to dragons.
			-_Non-dragons_, he's unlikely to introduce himself to at all, or allow to call
			 him by any name.
	-Arvaec was a bit of a sociopath to begin with.
		-The dragon Arvaec was offered up to wasn't an idiot and was looking for servants,
		 and so set conditions on the deal ("a hale and healthy young elf") and reserved
		 the right to refuse an offering.
		-The elves weren't idiots either, though, and knew they could use the cost of their
		 island paradise to dispose of their more ruthless kin, a trait the dragon was more
		 likely to consider a merit than a flaw.
			-Such elves were also somewhat easier to convince they'd earned a "great honor".
	-Training to serve Tiamat did _not_ improve that.
	-It _did_ instill a distinct obsequiousness, at least towards dragons.
		-It's very much a part of his role. His master Sszythrach, and dragons in general,
		 must never be seen to fail or be flawed. If Sszythrach needs to say there was an
		 error, to fawn, or otherwise express something unsuitable to his majesty, he sends
		 Arvaec, who claims all fault.
			-Arvaec also handles spending money for Sszythrach.
		-The two of them have something of a good cop / bad cop routine.
			-Fawning and lies from Arvaec, with Sszythrach jumping in with threats or
			 caught lies (Sense Motive, "I can smell your lies, meat.") as necessary.
		-Arvaec tends to use "this one", instead of "I".
	-Arvaec views Sszythrach as practically an avatar of Tiamat, in her aspect as a
	 destroyer especially.
		-I'm imagining Arvaec was the servant sent to fetch Sszythrach from his home on
		 Gehenna.
			-Seeing Sszythrach, Arvaec was very much impressed. He'd been exposed to many
			 dragons over the course of more than a decade of serving Tiamat, and quickly
			 saw that the young dragon he'd been sent to fetch was uncommonly large and
			 fierce for his age.
			-Sszythrach being summoned for an important errand by the planar council also
			 boded well for his prospects, and Arvaec swore himself to Sszythrach's service.
		-Sszythrach is both a holy child of Arvaec's god and, Arvaec also believes, his
		 ticket to greater status and power, the foremost servant of a powerful master.
			-He has read the omens, and they bode well. Tiamat, though, has been known to
			 be deceitful. . .

-Sszythrach awakening after Arvaec's lichdom:
	S: My elf, what has happened to you? You appear. . . changed, and reek of death.
	A: It shames me to admit, your furiousness, that this one suffered some. . . set backs, during my investigation of a trifling disturbance to the South, during your nap. Your name was not disgraced, though, and the matter was resolved, even winning you some new servants in the process. In doing that, however, this one required some help from our dark lady, to rise again, stronger, and better able to serve. . .
	S: This is my malevolent mother's work?!? Well. . . Sszythrach pays his debts and Tiamat the Avaricious is *not* to be cheated. . .
	S: We shall erect a temple to Tiamat, here at the Rookerie. Something worthy of The Queen of Evil Dragonkind!
	A: My lord, it greives me to also inform you there has been a disturbance amongst the dwarves. Fine stonework may be hard to come by. They. . .
	S: Do not trouble me with that! I know my bitch mother's tastes. Gild the hell out of everything and she'll not worry about the details. I'll commit the sums required from my hoard, lest she cast her eyes that way herself.
	A: A most excellent and wise plan, your volcanic majesty. The miners will be immediately set to finishing a suitable cavern.
	A: . . . Also, as a part of her working, the lady created this token, which this one offers up to you. My life was yours, and so too is my unlife.
	(My original thought was to dedicated twice a phylactory's creation cost from Sszythrach's hoard, but, looking it up, the phylactory costs 120k gp., and that just once accounts for almost all of Sszythrach's hoard. So, I might need to commit a lesser sum, or pay it over time.
	That last bit is Arvaec offering up his phylactory to Sszythrach, which Sszythrach is going to embed in his teeth, joining some castings of Refuge in his increasingly enchanted grill. That's a huge gesture on Arvaec's part, but it's got some cynical practicality behind it, not just subservience. Where better to guard something so priceless than in the possession of an especially terrifying dragon? It's really an extension of the bargain he had already made: yoking his fate to Sszythrach's rising star.)
