-Dragon: Sszythrach, implacable and furious.
	-Up to date epitaphs: Sszythrach, Champion of Dragons, He Before Whom Foes Crumble
	-Young Pyroclastic Dragon (13 HD)
		-Feats: 5 from HD
			1	Ability Focus (Monster Manual pg. 303)
			3	Multiattack (Monster Manual pg. 304)
			6	Heighten Breath (Draconomicon pg. 70)
			9	Recover Breath (Draconomicon pg. 73)
			12	Shape Breath  (Draconomicon pg. 73)
				-Future:
					15	Juvenile		Extend Spell
					18	Young Adult		Persistent Spell
					21	Adult			Is Epic Leadership necessary? Well, Epic Spellcasting may now be! Alternately, Extra Turning for Divine Metamagic.
					24	Mature Adult	
					27	Old				
					30	Very Old		
					33	Ancient			Quicken Spell-Like Ability (Produce Flame)
					36	Wyrm			Rapid Breath
					39	Great Wyrm		
			-Potential future ones:
				-Well, with cleric casting now, Divine Metamagic shenanigans might be your major
				 goal with feats.
					-Shit, you'll be a high enough caster level to begin persisting great stuff like
					 Divine Favor the honest way, on top of whatever your turning lets you do.
				-Improved Multiattack (Draconomicon pg. 70)
					-Hmm. . . Epic Prowess's (Epic Level Handbook pg. 54) untyped +1 to all attacks
					 may be better, depending on how many full vs. single attacks you find yourself
					 making.
				-Improved Speed (Draconomicon pg. 71)
				-Rapidstrike (Draconomicon pg. 73)
				-Improved Rapidstrike (Draconomicon pg. 70)
				-Improved Initiative (The Epic Dire Charge feat requires it.)
					-Oh, Dire Charge kind of sucks, since it only works on the first round of any
					 given combat.
					-Still not a bad feat to have, I.I., because Sszythrach acting means many after
					 him in initiative are ash before they can act themselves.
				-Flyby Breath (Dragonlance Campaign Setting pg. 85): http://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/dragonlance-campaign-setting--98/flyby-breath--3612/index.html
					-Requires Flyby Attack first, but is great, and would probably enable the burrow pop out.
						https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Flyby_Attack
				-Strafing Breath may then be an interesting follow up: http://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/dragonlance-campaign-setting--98/strafing-breath--3701/index.html
				-Hover would let you make full attacks in the air, along with other handy effects.
					-Eh, against _other hovering targets. . ._
				-Rapid Breath (Savage Species pg. 39)
					-Same effect as Recover Breath, stacking with it.
					-Is the book kosher?
						-Discussed it briefly with Lesley and sounded like it was. Might want to
						 doublecheck when you actually take it, though.
					-Needs a (tax) feat of Quicken Spell-Like Ability (Savage Species pg. 38), which
					 in turn requires minimum caster levels for the ability.
						-Produce Flame is a level 1 Druid spell, and thus easiest, requiring caster
						 level 10.
						-Sound Burst would be slightly useful, but not possible until 12th.
					-Your caster level for your spell-likes sucks, though. It's equal to your age
					 category, since you don't get Sorcerer casting, and thus you don't reach 12
					 until you're a great wyrm.
					-Options for working around that:
						-Supernatural Transformation (Savage Species pg. 39)
							-Spell-like becomes Supernatural, dodging spell resistance and bumping
							 caster level to HD (other properties are useless), meaning you could
							 manage this as fast as you can spare the feats. 2 feat tax, though.
								-Oh! I don't think this works, as the ability will no longer be
								 Spell-Like, and thus ineligible for Quickening.
							-Opens quickening other spell-likes too, though only the Walls look
							 remotely worth it. They benefit a lot from this boosting their caster
							 level, but are only once per day, unlike Sound Burst's three per day.
								-Wall of Stone's permanent nature _would_ be kind of cool, but
								 building isn't really Sszythrach's style.
					-This is probably the way to go, as fast as possible.
						-Well, with no work around, that's Quickening at Ancient, then this at
						 Wyrm. Reasonably fair, given it's impact on your power.
				-Great Constitution [Epic] (Epic Level Handbook pg. 56) is actually a solid choice,
				 increasing Constitution by 1 each time you take it.
					-You otherwise have odd Constitution, so one copy at least is clearly worth it.
					-Then again, Wish or a Manual would also solve that odd number, and might be
					 somewhat trivial by the time you can take epic feats.
						-Arvaec will probably be able to cast it for you by that time.
				-Fast Healing [Epic] (Draconomicon pg. 70)
					-Fast Healing 3 would be pretty cool. Good for hit and runs too.
				-Damage Reduction [Epic] (Epic Level Handbook pg. 52)
					-Adding 3/- to your DR isn't bad, and it stacks in some way with your natural
					 DR, but you should probably look into the details of what stacking DR means.
				-Improved Spell Resistance [Epic] (Epic Level Handbook pg. 60) could also be good,
				 but is only +2.

	-As a Young dragon:
		-Level 1: 15
		-Level 2: 2
	-Kobolds might be attractive, as well as thematic.
		-You could use them as miners.
	-Dwarves could be another option for a similar role, if nice, scaly kobolds aren't available.


-Initial discussion of character details with Lesley and Jake: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/810970288618995724
	-Divine Metamagic and Persistent Spell are kosher.
-Useful post with Persistent options for <= level 4: https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/d-d-3-5-cheese-up-my-cleric.592975/post-14408135
-Your Scaleykind rebuking seems to be a different pool of attempts per day: https://www.enworld.org/threads/cleric-domains-extra-turning.104080/
	-It even gets it's own bonus form the same Extra Turning: https://dndtools.net/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/extra-turning--1050/

-Questions I'm going to need a ruling on:
1. What meets Persistent Spell's qualification that the spell must have a "personal range or a fixed range"?
The feat: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Persistent_Spell
Pretty obviously Personal: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Persistent_Spell
Touch?: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Protection_from_Energy
Fixed, numerical range with an area?: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Prayer
	Personal only.
2. Can you mix movement modes in a single move action? How does that work? Couldn't find an official system.
