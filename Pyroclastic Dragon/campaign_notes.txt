-2/19/21:
	-Your first session, though others have played for many sessions now.
	-The planar council is much like the one on the material plane, albeit without the three great
	 dragons that dominate the material version.
		-They hold the material council to be traitors to the planar council, due some some event in
		 the very distant past.
		-As such, the other party members were treated rather poorly, and the emerald dragon
		 Dokinanth began uttering the language of the gods, and chaos broke loose.
			-Mass random transmutations and the like.
		-Such chaos had not been seen since Hlal, who went on to become a god.
	-Most dragons don't exactly worship gods, seeing them as more like forces of nature.
		-The lesser races, in turn, worship dragons as gods.
			-At least on the material plane. The gods are more active among the outer planes,
			 though, and are more often actively worshipped.
	-The dragon that sent you was a pyroclastic dragon saved by Starfire and Dokinanth in a
	 previous session.
		-He is known as "Isriboss, who sundered the sky"
		-"Why have you called me forth from Gehenna?"
			-"Dokinanth and Starfire, who saved my life, were assaulted in the council chambers by
			 assassins. Mostly battle dragons. You are to find out what happened, why they did this."
		-"What's in it for me?"
			-"I don't beat you and humiliate you before the council?"
			-"Fair enough."
	-I was then sent to the (unexpectedly) ruined rookerie, and made the acquintance of the party.
	-We then did some digging through the rubble, in search of buried hordes.
		-Beneath the party's chamber, we also found an old dwarven door.
			-Dokinanth claimed to see text in the true speech on the door, though it was blank to
			 the rest of our eyes.
			-He said the text was involved in binding this "Speaker" that had somehow betrayed them.
				-Apparently it is of some kind of innately magical race.
				-Known as "The Speaker of Absalom", he had been Absalom's second, and had served the
				 council, but used the clutch's findings to pursue some forbidden power, betraying
				 the council.
		-We also debated what to do with absent Absalom's horde.
	-While we talked, though, a clutchmate of the others, Thunder's Maw, plumetted from the sky,
	 seemingly tackling something.
		-By the time we got there, it was chared by Thunder's breath, but we could still see the
		 symbol of the tentacled god the other's had faced on the clothes of the humanoid figure.
			-Indeed, the figure seemed to have a rubbery and squamous appearance.
		-Thunder said that others of the kind were seen on the island.
		-Thunder had been subject to some kind of corruption, that the others had apparently
		 encountered as well, and Dokinanth cured him with the divine water they had obtained in
		 some celestial realm.
			-It sounded like one of the godly realms to me, though not a specific plane I
			 recognized.
	-Starfire can apparently summon sharks to do his bidding, so they were able to scent blood in
	 the water and lead us in search of where we think Absalom may have fallen.
	-We flew for days, signs of devestation beneath us.
		-Ruined villages, the scars of battles between titanic creatures, etc.
	-As we neared our destination, we began to see basalt columns, some carved with strange draconic
	 faces, and eventually reached an enormous basalt column, hundreds of feet tall.
		-In slits on the side of the structure, we saw ancient ballista, most rendered inoperable by
		 weathering.
		-There was also a great gate.
		-Dokinanth can apparently read the history of objects, and found it to have been created by
		 a Lawful Neutral draconic demi-god, eons old.
		-The whole damn thing is magical, and decidedly dangerous. Somehow an enormous prismatic
		 wall seems to be awaiting some kind of triggering.
	-The sharks indicated there was something in the deeps, off the coast of the island.
	-As such, we spent the night, so Arvaec could prep new spells.
		-The area was super creepy, though.
		-We also all dreamt of a skeletal, crystal-encrusted dragon (that the others recognized as
		 looking a bit like Absalom), battleing a titanic creature that ripped him in half, dropping 
	-We left the cohorts ashore, and then flew out over the water.
		-The surface was slick with the corruption that had affected Thunder.
			-Now risking actually being exposed to it, I got some details about it, and it
			 sounds nastily mutagenic.
			-We wisely avoided it, flying out past the limit of it, and then diving into the water.
		-Beneath the surface, we indeed found Absalom, within a bubble of air under the sea.
			-His back appeared to be broken.
		-The rest of the party warned of his corruption, and we debated how to deliver the healing
		 water to him.
		-Dokinanth used some magic items to call up an animated skeleton, to deliver it.
		-As we approached, Absalom tried to warn us off telepathically, saying he could not control
		 his body.
		-It looked like it was a painful process, Absalom calling for us to kill him repeatedly.
		-It also did not seem to entirely work.
		-The party also had a Ring of Turning that had apparently staved off some degree of
		 corruption before, so we sought to place it on one his paralyzed rear limbs.
		-Well, that caused him to disintegrate. . .
			-We gathered as much of the ashes as we could, in some conjured boxes, and returned to
			 The Rookerie.
	-As we returned, we found The Rookerie far more deserted than we left it.
		-The cohorts we left behind report enormous insects roaming the island at night.
			-Not the cultists, but perhaps related to them?
		-Perfidious, the large red dragon (though maybe younger than something that size should
		 be?), then landed.
			-He's missing a tongue and cannot speak, but Dokinanth can manifest Mind Link.
			-He received images of fallen elves, as well as Mendacium, a black dragon of the
			 party's clutch, lying on the ground bloodied, as well as another known to them, Blade
			 Tooth, also injured.
				-The elves are Blade Tooth's followers.
		-We followed Perfidious to the location, finding Mendacium dead, and Blade Tooth with
		 severe injuries to one wing. The elves were dead or unconscious.
			-Blade Tooth was unconscious, and had wounds from the claws of an enormous dragon,
			 presumably the corrupted Absalom.
			-We were able to heal Blade Tooth somewhat, and Estrella mostly managed to set the
			 wing, but he did not wake.
			-We got one elf talking. He confirmed that Blade Tooth was wounded by Absalom, but
			 they also fought creatures that came for him later.
				-He knew what we meant when we asked if they were the insect creatures we'd heard
				 of, but he knew them to be trolls, albeit strange looking ones.
					-Sunlight seems to be what stops their regeneration.
	-Returning again to The Rookerie, this time carrying an injured Blade Tooth, we found an adult
	 Topaz dragon, who asked us what the fuck was going on here, having just arrived.
		-Estrella gave an impressive, breathless run down of the whole campaign thus far.
		-The wide-eyed dragon said she had to go tell her clan, just repeating it when Estrella
		 pled for help, and eventually flying off.
	-We had Arvaec use Sending to contact the "mushroom queen" that had previous resurrected
	 Estrella, to ask her aid with Absalom.
		-Her response said she thought Absalom had recovered.
	-That was my only Sending for the day, so we decided to rest and prepare more.
		-That evening, though, we learned where the trolls were coming from that damned door in
		 the caverns below us!


-Oh, should I have ability increases for HD?
	-Nope: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/815361425760845894
-I asked Lesley about why the Planar Council considers the council on the material plane to be
 traitors, and got a detailed answer: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/815361425760845894
	-Boils down to the material folks supposedly stealing power from the gods, to overthrow The
	 Planar Council and the gods both, and maybe even consorting with humans in the process.
	-Sszythrach can understand the first, but better not see any human fraternization.
-Raise digging up the hoard of the now dead Absalom next session?
	-Or, Dokinanth seems set on reclaiming the rookerie, making it his seat. Perhaps just set a
	 guard over it, and leave whatever possible traps in place for now?


-3/5/21:
	-We started the session outside that creepy door, having trailed the tracks of the freaky
	 trolls to it.
	-Aaannndd we walked straight into the creepy thing.
	-Inside, there was a series of caves, and another creepy thing, some kind of amalgamation of
	 insects and such digging a hole in the first cave.
	-Dokinanth, currently invisible, performed some kind of mind-meld with the thing.
		-Charmed, it gave him images of the Speaker, covered in some kind of fungus and dripping
		 that corrupting black icho. It also included images of humanoids from the Rookerie being
		 brought to the speaker.
	-We found the speaker in another part of the chamber, indeed covered in that fungus.
		-Also surrounded by blackened humanoid skulls, with evidence bloody bodies had been tossed
		 into the web filled crevices around him.
	-The Speaker turned to us, telling us we need not fear, that his magics had been "taken" from
	 him.
		-Some punishment by "The Lord of Broken Names".
			-Apparently this is the entity Dokinanth ignored the offer of (the god that wanted him
			 to serve a year and a day?).
		-He named us the ones that _freed_ Absalom, claiming Absalom has many forms, and that the
		 destruction of this one is but a set back.
			-He claimed Absalom was a dracolich, made by his hand.
				-Exodon and Bloodtide, the other two ancient wyrms of the council, were the same.
				-No ordinary liches, though, he claimed they needed no disguises as they were a
				 special variety, ones that had never died. Until now, anyways.
			-Starfire asked, then, "Where are their phylactories? If you made them, you should know."
				-The Speaker claimed they were skulls, found down the stairway to the NE.
			-Why is he helping us, Dokinanth asked?
				-"My name was broken once."
					-As a result, "he took a title."
				-He tried to find the souls of the unborn, to ask them if they wished to exist or not.
					-Sounds like he had sent the material clutch off in search of the same.
				-His people, who'd aided him, were struck down by the gods, leaving only him.
				-He then served dragons, that he may use them to serve his own goals.
				-The result is him punished again by the gods, confined here and unable to perform
				 the magics that sustained his life.
				-Now, he claims to want only vengeance.
					-The ancient wyrms he served sought only to grow fat on the power of the souls of
					 others. They too were cursed by the gods, marked in the eyes of dragon hunters.
						-The council was formed by the ancient trio in response, to protect them.
							-Those following it were then in turn marked.
						-This _does_ fit the reputation of the material council across the planes,
						 as traitors and theives of god-power.
		-Dokinanth believes he could perhaps free this wretch, though at the cost of thoroughly
		 pissing off The Breaker of Names.
			-Working with gods who have had their own names broken may be an option for
			 counterbalancing that.
				-Or some divine names written in The Breaker's temple Dokinanth mentioned?
				-"The Oarsman" may be one of these, once known as "Isriboss, who sundered the sky"
					-Wait, isn't that the name and title of the pyroclastic dragon the material
					 clutch saved (and who bullied me into helping them)?
						-Yep.
						-The breaking of a name can apparently leave "pieces". Perhaps this dragon
						 has some connect to The Oarsman?
		-Ugh. Apparently the weird trolls are "birthed from his corruption."
			-Dokinanth says the corruption is a result of breaking names.
	-We opted to deal with the phylactories first.
		-(I also kind of wanted to get out of earshot of this guy.)
		-The Speaker warned us, though, that we should be prepared. He had long ago summoned some
		 kind of guardians.
			-Asked for details, he went on about divine power, cryptically, suggesting that these
			 things are in some way fragments of Isriboss. Celestials, perhaps?
		-I went off in search of Arvaec, to buff me.
	-Entering the depths, we did indeed find ourselves facing a swan winged humanoid, standing
	 before an alter containing a natural spring.
		-It smelled of seawater in there, with a visible tide to the water pooling around the alter.
		-There was also a pile of dragon skulls with an angelic corpse splayed across them, it's
		 chest cut open with a section of rune inscribed dragon bone protruding from it.
		-Dokinanth greeted the angel, which replied with a warning that he must destroy us if we
		 came any closer.
			-He seemed to be intent on guarding the corpse of his master and the blasphemous secrets
			 of the ritual, even at the cost of preserving those that performed it.
	-As such, battle was joined.
		-Arvaec's arrows were burned from the sky with a wave of the celestial's hand, but Dokinanth
		 did some awful naming shit, causing it to kneel and bleed corruption.
		-He could not stand before Sszythrach, though, and is now ash.
	-With it's defeat, we examined the ritual skull pile.
		-Dokinanth shattered the skulls with his breath, but the corpse and the strange bone in
		 it's wound remained.
		-The runic bone showed, in the true speech, the names of the three wyrms, and also dripped
		 necromancy.
		-_Naming_ the bone fragile, Dokinanth then shattered it. The corpse, in turn, disintegrated
		 into a swarm of maggots, and then into bloody mist.
			-We could feel a strange wave of calm pass over the area.
	-We then conferred about what to do with The Speaker.
		-I got some details on the party's history, particularly with Isriboss.
		-They saw him attacked by dragon hunters on Sigil, where they distracted the hunters.
	-We returned to The Speaker.
		-He spoke of the details of the ritual then, using the skulls, ideally of your own kind, to
		 feed on the souls of their former owners. It involves scribing your true name on them.
			-He claimed this was within Dokinanth's power.
			-The wyrms sought an even greater power, which is why they placed the godling atop the
			 pile and had The Speaker carve out it's heart.
		-I offered Arvaec's aid and healing to him, in part to get Arvaec closer and get an idea of
		 how long he could live, but he claimed only one substance could sooth him, water from the
		 celestial planes.
			-Water Dokinanth produced his remaining three viles of, to The Speaker's wonder and
			 delight.
			-At The Speaker's suggestion, Arvaec employed a vial of the water in the casting of
			 Restoration, healing 1d4 corruption as a result.
	-We then rested, to prep new spells for Arvaec.
		-Starfire's followers collected the skulls of the fallen dragons, along with their humanoid
		 servants, with an eye to that ritual.
			-Final count was around 50 skulls, about 3 of each material dragon type.
		-Once more, we had crazy, vivid dreams.
			-Bat winged, face tentacled monster, that we feel is coming towards us.
				-We were left with a distinct feeling of doom.
				-The party tells me it looks like the beast they awoke.
	-We headed quickly down to the basement, for a couple of reasons.
		-Arvaec performed the Quest ritual, swearing The Speaker as a "fuedal vassal" of
		 "Sszythrach and the clutch of Starfire".
		-Dokinanth then went to work on the true name ward on the door.
			-It now targets "The Spanker of Absalom", and The Speaker was able to leave.
		-With that nightmare racing towards us (if dreams are real, anyways), we raced to perform
		 the ritual with those skulls.
			-When Dokinanth asked for a volunteer, fearlessly I stepped forward, and was sained.
				-Or, well, 2/5th sained?
			-We also sent a runner to catch The Speaker and ask him things about tentacles and
			 stuff.
				-The weather is freaky. Like, raining up freaky.
				-In the fog, the runner could see our nightmare.
				-The speaker, standing on an outcropping, stood facing it, speaking in tongues with
				 his eyes rolled back as he frothed at the mouth.
				-The nightmare creature moved onto the island, near an area that had been used as a
				 dragon graveyard.
				-The runner bludgeoned The Speaker, tied a rope to him, and dragged him back inside.
	-Dokinanth linked his mind to the insane, incapacitated Speaker.
		-He got images of The Speakers torment, but also images of him digging frantically in the
		 rubble above, for that sword from The Mushroom Queen that the party once held.
		-I raced upstairs and began digging for it.
		-Outside is still freakier.
			-The nightmare seems to be attacking the area where surivors from The Rookerie had setup
			 a hospital.
		-Digging through drifts of platinum and gold, I found a sword, a cup, a disk, and a wand.
			-It is indeed the sword in question.
			-This disk is connected to a chain, and is perhaps an amulet.
				-It apparently gives my SR 30.
			-Starfire, trying the wand, found it created a 60 ft. burst around him, suppressing
			 magic in some manner.
				-The cup, in turn, filled with water, could be drunk, to render you immune to that
				 suppressing effect (for how long?).
				-Items don't seem to work in the field, but the sword and amulet notable _do_.


-3/19/21:
	-Overconfident tyrant-wyrms that we are, we flew towards where the god-beast was attacking the
	 encampment full of wounded.
	-We found it standing over some ruins, plunging it's tentacles again and again into the ground.
	-The various wounded dragon-servants were, in turn, being pulled beneath the earth by tentacles
	 emerging from it.
	-No cowards we, we delayed only half a minute for a few more spells from Arvaec and Caltor
	 before charging at the horror.
		-We opened with a salvo of breath weapons, but it sadly survived disintegration.
		-With my breath recharging for 6 rounds after that, I began to tear into one of the thing's
		 legs.
			-Being the terrifying monster that I am, a full attack meant 109 damage.
		-That seemed to piss the beast off, though, and it grabbed me with a mass of tentacles and
		 _drew me into it's body._
	-I found myself in some kind of temple-like structure.
		-Behind stood a doorway filled with inky, viscous blackness.
		-The floors were covered in a thick layer of dust, but showed recent-ish dragon foot prints
		 heading deeper into the structure.
		-In the first room, I found an immense statue of some dragon-like demon, a creature I
		 recognized as Rallastor, The Lord of Broken Names, and the god-thing that had
		 previously attempted to to get the party to commit to serve it for a year and a day.
		-Sure enough, as I headed deeper into the structure, I found some marked pillars I vaguely
		 recalled from Dokinanth's history of the clutch thus far, and in a room just North of
		 there, the god itself.
		-It claimed that the monster attacking the island would, even if defeated, merely rise again
		 the next night, stronger, and attack again.
		-It offered me the same deal as the rest of the party, to serve for a year and a day in
		 exchange for addressing the tentacle nightmare permanently.
			-When asked how it would do so, it claimed that the creature's name had been broken
			 once, and that it could repair the name.
		-I accepted the deal, with one caveat: that I would not harm or work against the clutch of
		 Starfire, Dokinanth, and Estrella.
			-After all, my word would be worth little if I foreswore my promise to guard them.
		-In accepting, I was marked by the god, over my heart and collar bone.
		-Rallastor then instructed me to open one of the two chests.
			-Inside, there was an inscribed jar. Rallastor claimed that creatures of corruption could
			 be bound within it and collected, using one of the shards of The Sword of Io.
			-It told me that the creatures were meant to guard the places that the broken named
			 were kept, not to escape, and that they must be returned.
		-I was then instructed to open the second chest.
			-Inside was a book, which I was told could restore the tentacle horror's name, ending
			 the threat.
			-Gods had apparently been forbidden from doing so, but _Dokinanth_ isn't a god. . .
		-I was warned that Rallastor would be able to see through my eyes, and that it would call on
		 me when I was needed.
	-I was then returned to the basement of The Rookerie and went to find the clutch.
		-I recounted what happened to me, and gave both book and jar to Dokinanth.
		-Dokinanth did not seem too sure what spell could be used to bind the creatures of
		 corruption, but did seem to quickly grasp the book.
			-We eventually worked out that the Magic Jar spell used with the necromancy shard was
			 the way to go.
			-It seems it can even pull corruption from a living thing, restoring it.
		-Dokinanth claimed he could not only restore the creature's name, "Isriboss" (!), but could
		 _change_ it in some fashion, restructuring a god.
		-That last produced endless debate on our part.
		-Eventually, we somewhat settled on the idea of adding Protection to his domains, and
		 perhaps Dragons, but were also interested in maybe extracting concessions from a god in
		 exchange for the restoration of it's name.
	-With those concession dollar signs in our eyes, we attempted a Sending to Isriboss-the-dragon.
		-In response, we heard, "Stay away. Sigil under attack by human dragon hunters."
		-Well, that about settled it. Dokinanth restored the name, adding Protection and Dragons
		 to his portfolio.
	-Immediately after the hour of naming work, a servant ran in, saying we needed to come outside
	 and see what was happening.
	-Outside in the sky, despite the daylight, stars shown in the sky and were rearranging
	 themselves, into a new constellation.
		-A lightening bolt and storm cloud.
	-The weather began to grow stormy, waves crashing agains the shores of the island.
		-We saw the shape of the tentacled nightmare on the horizon.
		-In a flash of light, it was suddenly an immense dragon, then a ship, then a small rowboat
		 with single oarsman.
		-That continued for some time, growing closer all the while.
		-Eventually, the images were all there at once, coming closer to one another, and then
		 merging together.
	-The end result was a figure with both human and draconic features.
		-It claimed to have live many lives, and received aid from us in many of them.
		-Dokinanth then requested it's help and protection, in the face of the calamity that had
		 befallen these islands, and which was now surging over Sigil.
		-It claimed itself still to weak, needing to seek out what priests remained that know its
		 oldest name, but named us it's champions.
			-Gain two of his four domains, and cleric casting like a cleric with level equal to
			 your HD.
				-Cohorts included! Arvaec is now a double cleric.
				-Those domains are Dragons, Protection, Ocean, and Storm.
				-The subject's alignment will determine what spells are available to them, ignoring
				 the deity's alignment.
	-We called the session there, with some exposition:
		-We began to rebuild the Rookerie, gathering up the hoards of the dead from the rubble, to
		 fund the effort.
		-One by one, we then fell to dragon-sleep, aging up.


-Age up and prepare cleric spells.
	-Dracononmicon has some interesting possibilities for you and Arvaec both, given it's relevance
	 to your nature.
	-Sszythrach:
		-Done!
	-Arvaec:
		-Done!
-Sort your gold.
	-You've got $XP (120,000 gp.) that you need to retain, plus 260,000 in spending money (each!).
		-You need to save up a reserve of 51,000 more to next grow older, but magic items count
		 half their value towards that.
	-This will heavily affect what you do for spell prep, since you now badly need a wisdom bonus.
	-Stuff to buy:
		-Periapt of Wisdom +6 for 36,000
			-Do something with your spell resistance amulet, then?
			-Or commission this with a different slot?
				-2x cost for no slot.
				-1.5x cost for "Uncustomary space limitation": https://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/creatingMagicItems.htm
					-Would a helm even need that, though?
						-Body slots: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/creatingMagicItems.htm#bodySlotAffinities
						-Eh, maybe wisdom falls under the amulet's affinity for "discernment".
				-So, another 18,000 for some other slot is probably the way to go.
		-Manual of Bodily Health +5 for 137,500 (fuck yeah!)
		-(Fingerless) Gloves of Dexterity +6 for 36,000
			-Initiative, AC, Reflex save, and skills!
		-Cheap protective items?
			-Ring of Protection +2 for 8,000
			-Vest of Resistance +2 for 4,000 (MIC pg. 147)
		-Spell food:
			-Plane Shift foci:
				-Material, Gehenna, Sigil, others?
			-Destruction focus: "Focus: A special holy (or unholy) symbol of silver marked with verses of anathema (cost 500 gp)."
			-Holy water font (100 gp.) for Scrying and Greater Scrying?
			-Some number of batches of 10,000 gp. worth of diamonds, for Resurrection.
				-Lets do just one.
			-Some number of Refuge items, 1,500 gp. per? https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Refuge
				-2 to bring Avaec, 2 to bring the bearer to Arvaec's room, totalling 6,000?
		-So:
			137,500	Manual of Bodily Health +5
			 54,000 Mitre of Wisdom +6 (1.5 x Periapt cost custom item)
			 36,000	(Fingerless) Gloves of Dexterity +6
			  8,000	Ring of Protection +2
			  4,000	Vest of Resistance +2 (MIC pg. 147)
			 10,000	Gp. worth of diamonds, for Resurrection
			  6,000	4 castings of Refuge, 2 to bring Avaec, 2 to bring the bearer to Arvaec's room
			        at The Rookerie: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/refuge.htm
					They're in the form of ornate golden _dental_ crowns on the backmost of Sszythrach's
					teeth, spy-suicide-tooth-style.
				500	Focus for Destruction: A special unholy symbol of silver marked with verses of anathema.
			    100	Font of Unholy Water in front of Arvaec's room and Sszythrach's lair, at The Rookerie,
					for Scrying with.
				 35 Silver Unholy Symbol (10 over list, as an arbitrary fee for something custom)
				100	Four sets of Divination components	
				400 Four sets of diamond dust for Restoration
				250	One set of True Seeing components
			-------
			Total: 256,885 gp. spent.
			-(Old) Math:
				137,500+54,000+36,000+8,000+4,000+10,000+6,000+500+100+25+100=256,625
		-Done applying the above.
-Finish that saining and ritual?
-Eventually sort your followers out.
	-Probably something to address when next there's downtime.
		-I think I heard stuff about _sleeping_ for periods of time? Maybe how the clutch has
		 previously advanced in age categories?
			-If need be, you can always have Arvaec gathering people. He'd be doing most of the
			 work either way.
		-THAT TIME IS NOW!
	-Recent apocalyptic turmoil probably means there's an assortment of former dragon-followers now
	 bereft of masters. That's probably an easy opportunity to recruit followers, ones used to
	 serving a dragon and looking for a new protector after the death, destruction, and/or
	 corruption of their last lord.
		-The sort who are likely to seek that out again are also the sort that likely line up with
		 you, alignment-wise.
	-A round of questions for Lesley, concerning followers:
		My next set of questions for you, @lesley (DM)#8861 , concerns follower related stuff:
		.
		1. This being our first downtime since I joined, here is where I was figuring I'd sort out my followers. I'm new to The Material Plane, but am also a dragon on these islands, and recent catastrophes having claimed the lives of several dragons here, I was imagining recruiting followers from those dead dragons' ex-servants. Does that sound like a generally reasonable plan?
		.
		2. Pyroclastic dragons being lawful evil and dragon-as-a-metaphor-for-a-tyrant being a thing, I was imagining playing up the fuedal angle of this all. As such, I'm imagining Sszythrach's followers as his retinue of knights and men-at-arms, maybe salted with a few skilled professionals, like a steward or mining experts (Sszythrach is interested both in the accumulation of mineral wealth and in lair construction). I'm envisioning the followers, in turn, being supported by tribute (and maybe mining labor?) they extract from the locals. I'm thinking those locals wouldn't number among my followers, with my actual followers being the folks that spend most of their time bullying these notional locals (the profit from getting to do so with the backing of a dragon probably being most of why they follow Sszythrach).
		Does that sound generally reasonable, both in who I'm counting as a follower and in a story sense? In particular, can the archipelago the Rookerie is located in actually support this? That is, are there enough people living in the area, can Sszythrach reasonably claim some kind of territory, etc.?
		.
		3. How do you want to me to handle stating out followers? Detailed characters with a free hand in design choices (PC classes? NPC ones only?)? Picking NPC stat blocks out of the DM's Guide? Handwave-ily, with just a couple sentences describing who they all are, along the lines of what's in #2 above?
		.
		4. Loosely related to followers, Arvaec, and now Sszythrach too, can create undead. The recent cataclysm seems to provide the perfect time to do so, there likely being both a labor shortage and a surfeit of corpses. Sszythrach isn't about to defile the corpses of dragons, but is otherwise a stranger in a strange land, and will try to read the room a bit, as it were, before creating the undead servants that no one would blink an eye at back home in Gehenna. Does that seems likely to elicit torches and pitchforks here, if confined to dead servants? If not, anything fancy available to me in the way of corpses, or just an assortment of dead elves, dwarves, and gnomes? I wasn't around for all the fighting that seems to have taken place here.

			-In response:
				-On followers:
					As to corvee labor from the locals, fuedal-flavored protection is exactly the angle I'm going for. I'm thinking that, in looking to both settle in and to take advantage of the opening created by recent losses, Sszythrach is aiming to, in typical dragon-y fashion, establish a territory for himself, providing hunting grounds and tribute both.
					He and Arvaec sort of have a bad cop / good cop thing, with Arvaec skilled in Diplomacy and Bluff while Sszythrach provides ample Intimidate. With that, they're going to aim to co-opt existing leadership where they can (convincing the local strongman to follow Sszythrach instead of the now dead dragon that used to protect them from the beasts of the wood and intercede when other dragons eyed their livestock) and to install followers into similar positions where a gap now exists after the cataclysm. From that, I'm expecting some minimal-in-game-terms amount of tribute in meat, metal, and labor to pass it's way up to Sszythrach, but most of it to be consumed supporting the followers along the way.
					In other words, I think this is mostly just an elaborate justification for how my followers eat and what they do with their time outside the limited amount of military service Sszythrach expects from them. Maybe along with some dose of explaining some minor lair modifications.
					With that all in mind, and knowing they'll be NPC classes, I'm imagining the vast majority of my followers are all Warriors, along with a handful of Experts (miners and maybe a seneschal). I also had the vague idea of something Sorcerer-like (I imagined as the result of dragon blood), being the former servant of a now-dead _red_ dragon, representing Sszythrach, a stranger in these islands of dragon clans, making his first tentative outreach to the red dragons that are perhaps the closest thing he has to kin here. I'll see how well the Adept or some such fits that notion, and, either way, spend some time writing out the counts of each class/role before next session.
					Does that all generally fit into the story? In particular, the notion of dragons claiming territories and demanding tribute of the locals in exchange for protection is based around what I see a lot of in the Monster Manual and Dracononmicon's flavor stuff, but I'm not sure how any of that changes within the Council of Wyrms setting.
	-Followers you can now have:
		1st	2nd	3rd	4th
		30	3	1	1
	-Their classes:
		-The 4th level is a gnomish Adept.
			-Claiming to have a bit of dragon blood himself, he reveres dragons as manifestations
			 of the divine. As a result, he was easily persuaded by Arvaec, a cleric of Tiamat with
			 a rather similar world view, and the great deeds of Sszythrach, after his old master
			 fell.
		-6 among the 1st level ones are Experts focused on mining, all dwarves save one gnome.
		-One of the 2nd level ones is also an expert, my new seneschal, with a mix of social skills,
		 appraise, and profession skills along the line of "Accountant" or "Steward".
		-All the rest are Warriors, a mix of mostly elves and dwarves, with some gnomes among them.
			-Sszythrach and Arvaec want to prioritize recruiting people already in a "village
			 strongman"-like role, or to seek to install them in similar.
			-Sszythrach is aiming to charge them with something along the lines of protecting the
			 village or whatever and organizing it to provide it's labor to Sszythrach's projects
			 for a few weeks a year. In return, they're to recieve the majority of the village's
			 tribute, with only some small share passed up to Sszythrach (probably in the form of
			 the occasional snack from their herds when he's awake).
-Lair construction?
	-Sszythrach's chamber with a long entrance tunnel starting next to a small temple of Tiamat,
	 with Arvaec having rooms connected to that.
		-Rely on follower-driven corvee labor to build it all?
		-Temple should probably be semi-public. Arvaec can even offer up typical clerical services
		 in exchange for donations and sacrifices to Tiamat.
-Ward your lair?
	-Glyphs, both regular and Greater.
	-Forbiddance: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/forbiddance.htm
		-It's super amazing!
	-Symbols of Stunning or Weakness at 5,000 gp. each.
		-The latter is probably more interesting.
		-Or Pain or Sleep for 1,000?
		-More?
	-Unhallow it for 1,000 plus 1,000 per level of attached spell?
		-The extra spell only lasts a year, though the base effects seem indefinite.
		-Still, probably only worth it if Arvaec needs the +4 to rebuke undead while making some.
	-Should Arvaec animate some dead?
		-Seems like there's plenty of candidates available, after this cataclysm.
		-Create Undead would cost 50 gp. per HD, and is probably what you want for ghasts.
			-Your level can do Ghasts, which have 4 HD by default. Don't see a template.
				-Would make good guards. Could you make a temple servant, or even priest from one?
					-They advance by HD instead of class levels in the monster entry, though.
			-Would need to command the undead created.
				-Command limit is HD equal to your level.
				-Commanding them:
					-An undead is commanded or destroyed if you have >= twice as many levels as it's HD
					 (PHB pg. 159).
					-You'll also need enough turning damage to turn it's HD. You do 2d6 + Cleric lvl. + Cha.
					-In other words, neither should be very limiting with the undead you can currently create,
					 unless you make enormous skeletons or zombies.
		-Animate Dead may still be worth doing too, it being a separate limit from commanded undead.
			-4 HD per caster level.
			-Material cost is 25. gp. per HD
			-Skeleton archers would be handy.
		-Oh! Sszythrach can manage Create Greater Undead. Same cost per HD, but can make shadows
		 or wraiths at CL 16. Can manage mummies with normal too (though only he can command them).
			-And he of course has his own HD limits!
		-Cost:
			-Commanded undead would 1,500 gp. to max both character's caps.
			-Animated dead would cost 3,000 gp. to max both character's caps.
			-Surprisingly cheap!
				-You could afford to do both without dropping below your required hoard value
				 easily, but _would_ spend slightly more than that 260k figure.
		-My follower questions for Lesley also touched on undead. Here's his answer: https://discord.com/channels/759886843801239603/759886844258943039/824707294406246480
			-What if I seek out those humanoids who _failed or betrayed_ dragons in the cataclysm?
				-Cowards or thieves who took advantage of the chaos could be bound to render in
				 death the service they abandoned or incurred in life. . .
		-Stuff to create:
			-Sszythrach controlled:
				-Controlled via rebuking:
					-2 Wraiths
					-2 Shadows
			-Arvaec controlled:
				-Controlled via rebuking:
					-1 Wraith
					-3 Shadows
		-Rebuke process?
			-Circles of Protection?
				-Doesn't seem to be necessary.
			-Ultimately, it's guaranteed to succeed against anything you could Command.
		-Next writeup on this front:
			Loosely related to the above, @lesley (DM)#8861, I've now had some time to turn my attention to the undead Sszythrach and Arvaec are capable of creating. Based on what we last discussed on the subject, the two of them "reading the room" as far as undead are concerned, I think they're going to aim to couch this in terms of punishment and redemption.
			Somewhat overlapping with the work of finding followers and generally addressing the cleanup after this catastrophe, I want Sszythrach and Arvaec to seek out those, dead or alive, who failed or betrayed dragons, with a particular focus on the territory Sszythrach is trying to claim and the servants of slain dragons. That of course includes egregious sins like theft from a hoard, but, the pair being lawful evil, they're also likely to be somewhat uncharitable in their application of justice here, and include things like guards who deserted their posts. Sszythrach and Arvaec should be reasonably good at this pursuit, Arvaec being good with Bluff and Diplomacy while Sszythrach is _great_ at Intimidate and Sense Motive, and both now having access to the wide range of truth-finding divine spells. Unfortunately, neither are very good at Gather Information, so I imagine them being largely reliant on convincing people to level accusations and then interrogating those involved.
			Servants of living dragons will of course be turned over to their masters, but, for the rest, Sszythrach intends to claim the right to admininister (draconian) justice. For almost everyone that lived through the cataclysm, especially in areas influenced by one of Sszythrach's new followers, that means handing them over to some local authority to be punished as they see fit with a warning that, "Sszythrach will be displeased if it's not appropriate. . ." Crimes among the dragon-less that warrant execution, though, like theft from a dragon or desertion, Sszythrach intends to carry out the sentence himself, and claim the body. Similarly, if they can find anyone who died but was guilty of something during the catastrophe (killed in the course of theft, died despite deserting, etc.; Speak With Dead might help with this), Sszythrach means to claim their bodies, and isn't above some exhumation with his burrow speed. In either case, Arvaec explains that, in death, they will be given an opportunity to _redeem_ themselves, for their failures and crimes.
			I'm hoping to turn up at least 8 bodies in this fashion and Sszythrach is, uh, _motivated_ to find these criminals. Sszythrach will also happily bury any beyond that which he turn up, for later use. With those 8 bodies, and via castings of Create Greater Undead by Sszythrach combined with (guaranteed to suceed against these low HD creatures) Rebuke Undead uses from Arvaec and Sszythrach both, I'd like to create the following, maxing out each of their undead commanding HD caps (though not the separate ones for Animate Dead):
			-Sszythrach controlled:
				-Controlled via rebuking:
					-2 Wraiths
					-2 Shadows
			-Arvaec controlled:
				-Controlled via rebuking:
					-1 Wraith
					-3 Shadows
			The spirits of anguished criminals, bound in death to serve the dragons they betrayed or failed in life, will make for terrifying guards and emissaries, and are exactly the sort of impression he's looking to make in his new home.
			How does that all sound? Generally reasonable? Fine to address in downtime, or something we want to roleplay?

-4/2/21: While the dragons are away, the cohorts play. . .
	-The dragons have been asleep for two years now.
	-Shiv has spent some time off the island, seeking shards of the sword of Io.
		-It's no secret that one is at The Oracle.
		-An old gold dragon guards the place, though, spending most of the time gazing into a pool
		 of water. He always seems to know Shiv and his clan of ninjas are coming, whenever they
		 sneak in. . .
			-Perhaps the Divination shard?
	-Caltor has spent his time focused on the trade caravans in the region, he having grown up
	 among them.
		-He's done brisk trade with the dwarves, trading more mundane wonders (trebuchet parts,
		 water boilers, and the like) found among the dead dragons' hoards, to fund repairs of The
		 Rookerie.
		-There has been word of giant bats attacking caravans on the mainland, NE of The Rookerie.
	-Arvaec has been whipping the locals near The Rookerie into shape, with the help of the rest of
	 Sszythrach's followers.
		-Militias and work gangs have been formed, organized beneath the followers.
		-About 30% of the abandoned treasure of The Rookerie has been hauled up to the surface
		 through their labor.
		-Undead labor has proven surprisingly popular among the locals, doing dangerous labor they'd
		 otherwise be stuck with.
			-They've even recieved honorary promotions from their foremen, decorations and the like
			 being hung from them.
	-There have also been a pair of volcanic eruptions North of The Rookerie, on the mainland, about
	 six months back.
		-Near the area giant bat attacks were reported.
		-The second was vastly larger than the first.
		-The populace was near to rioting, but Arvaec, via Control Weather, and Caltor, via song,
		 clamed them.
	-Three months ago, a giant meteor fell from the sky, towards the volcanoes.
		-It broke into three smaller objects _and then slowly settled around the volcano_.
		-The bat sighting have since increased. . .
	-About a week ago, a caravan was completely wiped out, with only one survivor that made it back
	 to The Rookerie, with a crazy report.
		-He claimed that the ground opened beneath the caravan, out of which bats poored. Giant bats
		 then came, attacking the smaller bats, ogres leaping from their backs and seemingly coming
		 to the aid of the caravan, only for beams to emerge from the new fissure, turning people to
		 stone.
		-Caltor remembered stories of an old Drow empire, since destroyed, that had once battled
		 bat-riding ogres, though the story is thousands of years old.
			-Ogres somehow _bred_ with bats, allegedly known as Desmodu.
			-At the end of the war, both sides were said to have wiped each other out battling over
			 a weapon, The Triumph Cask of Sorrows, that, once opened, laid waste to the empire.
				-The stories conflict, but some mention turning things to lava or stone.
	-Arvaec used Divination, asking what was in the meteor.
		-He received visions.
			-First a great eye.
			-Then a great egg, the eye imposed on it.
			-Finally a warning: beware the children of the great mother. . .
		-Knowledge(Religion) suggested an outer god known as The Great Mother.
			-One of a trio of ancient gods, including another known as The Watcher, though Arvaec
			 was unsure of the third.
			-The represent different aspects of chaos, but somehow contradictorily also tyranny
			 and domination.
		-Caltor, on the other hand, knew "The Great Mother's Children" are another name for
		 beholders. . .
	-Prepping for beholders:
		-We're largely broke (the cohorts, anyways), but we wanted some scrolls of Flesh to Stone.
			-As such, we set some of Arvaec's spectral servents to searching for more hoards lost
			 in the rubble.
				-They guided us to sufficient gold, and a semi-cursed ring.
				-The also spotted a bracer with entwined serpents on them, giving off some
				 form of aura visible to the undead searchers.
					-_Clearly_ an omen from Tiamat, we had to dig it up.
					-We accelerated the work, after resting, with many castings of Stone Shape.
					-A great deal more gold was recovered.
					-The aura, though, came not from the bracer, but what was inside it: a strangely
					 shifting gem. Hard to say how many faces it had, as it seemed to _change_.
					-It's aura of magic also seemed to constantly shift.
					-Caltor attempted to pick it up with mage hand, but spell was strangely changed,
					 Caltor seemingly sped up somehow. Shiv, having cast detect magic, saw the spell
					 Caltor cast _drawn_ into the gem, and returned changed.
					-Poking Shiv with Inflict Minor Wounds while he held the gem, I instead got to
					 clairaudibly hear someone chew.
						-Attempting to dispel the effect on myself, I instead got clairvoyance to
						 complete the picture, witnessing some nightmarish flesh blob creature
						 feasting. Apparently I could see Caltor's mother's house.
							-Actually, it appears to be a very fat hill giant.
					-Caltor and Shiv experimented further. Seems like it's range is <= 60', and it
					 requires line of effect.
						-Put it in a jug and make a chaos magic grenade!
					-Shit. Shiv showed it to the still-nuts Speaker, who reacted with 
		-We opted to rely on magic for sustenance.
	-We then set sail.
		-The volcanos seems to be spitting out more ash and debris over time, they sky growing every
		 darker as we near our target.
	-Making landfall, we came upon an enormous, and seemingly recent sinkhole.
		-Rough paths down through the rubble offered a descent, with some signs they've been used.
			-Cleared rubble, etc.
		-After descending only a short way, we found the ruins of some kind of underground road that
		 the sinkhole had breached.
			-Images on the wall included dwarves and drow both, illuminated by shafts leading to
			 lava.
				-Sometimes the two races warred, but cooperation was also in evidence. . .
				-Huh, they even include an image that looks an awful lot like that fat, ravenous
				 hill giant from my visions.
			-Caltor recognized this as one of the deep roads, originally constructed by the dwarves.
				-He thinks it may have led to a drow city, destroyed long ago.
					-The city of "Cael-Rekshaar"
				-Perhaps the city from those stories he earlier recalled. . .
				-He thought it was 90 miles or so away, in any case, so we started walking.
	-Crossing a fissure in the road, Caltor broke the rickity bridge.
		-Shiv and Arvaec tried to clamber down into the fissure and across, but Arvaec predictably
		 fell.
		-Caltor saved him with Dimension Door, which was apparently an option the whole damn time. . .
	-A day or so later, we encountered a collapsed section of the road, but something had already
	 cut a rough tunnel in the wall nearby, providing an apparent detour.
		-In that dark tunnel, we encountered some Desmodu.
		-The three of them were soundly defeated. One was dominated, but he did not speak any of our
		 languages.
		-They had, however, a prisoner of the same race, Viday, who did! He spoke an old dialect of
		 elven.
			-Half-starved, we (Heroes') feasted him.
			-He said he'd been a trader, from another clan. Cal, asking if he'd ever traded with
			 gnomes, but he said that his people had not encountered the surface races in a some
			 10 generations.
			-We recounted the tale of the caravan attack, and he in turn told us the strange
			 creatures, beholders by the description, had enslaved many of his people, forcing
			 them to excavate the ruins of the drow city..
				-He mentioned a chieftan, Bendar, who is the only one who's people would likely
				 have been helping the caravan. He resides past the ruins.
			-He also helped us translate with the dominated one.
				-We learned he is indeed under the influence of a beholder, one located in some
				 "Great Hall". Perhaps in the drow city?
			-We released Viday after he helped Cal provide some instructions to his dominated kin.
	-The next day, we came upon some kind of Desmodu settlement, full of actual bats too, of
	 various sizes.
		-Caltor now having prepared Tongues, we were able to ask his dominated one what clan they
		 were and they turned out to be more traders.
		-Thus, we peacefully approached them, and even traded with them.
			-We got some gas masks, for the fumes, and some cable, for any future climbing.
			-They even threw in a bat ride over their lava river.


4/30/21:
	-We headed on to the old Drow city, intent on entrance by stealth.
		-Reaching the city, we concealed ourselves with magic and then followed our dominated
		 Desmodu towards the beholder's chamber.
		-Passing through a door, we found a chamber full of Desmodu, apparently enslaved ice trolls,
		 and other, unliklier creatures, at work.
			-More slaves of the beholder?
			-The trolls looked emaciated, and are not typically found this far South.
	-Caltor gave the game away, attempting to cast Message and breaking his invisibility.
		-A Desmodu dropped from the ceiling, attacking him, but he was able to Dominate him before
		 he could reach Caltor (via Celerity).
		-Another, though, went yelling to the stairs in the middle of the room, and eyestalks began
		 to emerge from it. . .
	-Arvaec froze, but was disintegrated. :(
		-He went to meet his terrible god.
		-She said he was still of use to her, but also claimed that he served another. . .
			-"Your child?" "No, the storm that walks." "His gifts are yours, mistress!"
			-If the subject comes up again with her, perhaps highlight how her "child" bound the
			 storm to the service of dragons, to her own service and glory!
		-She offered to return him to life, if he would serve her. "Of course, mistress!"
			-She pressed a metallic cube into his chest. . .
			-Well, "life", as I'm now applying the lich template to Arvaec.
	-Caltor dug through my ashy remenants, meaning to preserve some sample for resurrection, but
	 finding the metallic cube, instead.
		-Touching it, something began to form, soon taking shape as a withered Arvaec.
		-The rest of the party seemed appropriately relieved, and the enslaved monsters gratifyingly
		 terrified.
	-The beholder had his slaves mining precious metals from some warped and melted amalgamation.
		-Caltor spoke with them and freed them. He attempted to rally them to us, to fight for their
		 freedom, but they pled starvation and weakness. They agreed to return, though, when they
		 had regained their strength, asking us where we came from.
		-Caltor revealed that we came from the Rookerie, a place they knew well, having once served
		 Cheynchaytion, a white dragon, now dead, but once a member of the council.
		-They also spoke of a shapeshifting mind flayer, servant of the beholder, who had enforced
		 order.
			-They thought it yet lived, and last saw it heading off to the South, to speak with the
			 salamanders that serve as the ruined city's smiths.
	-The door to the smithy was red hot, but Caltor opened it with Mage Hand.
		-A salamander emerged, elf-like but with a reptilian tail and a body all aflame.
		-It protested the interruption of it's work, but then saw the ruin of it's master's body, and
		 understood the situation.
		-Caltor tried to rally it to to our cause, but it professed it's tribe's alligiance to the
		 beholders was born of aid they'd offered against the Desmodu, who mean to block the lava
		 vents they rely on for survival.
		-Caltor volunteered that Sszythrach, who, by his very nature, warps the environment around
		 him to his comfort, could potentially provide them a new home.
		-He seemed somewhat amenable to the idea, but could not speak for his tribe.
			-However, he taught Caltor a series of simple songs that described the way to a
			 salamander citadel, and incidentally to a nearby, rival Desmodu enclave, likely
			 Bendar's people.
			-There, the leadership of his tribe could be found.
			-Heading there seems a reasonable idea. We can maybe shift the salamanders' alligiance
			 to us and/or make contact with the Desmodu that seem to be actively opposing the
			 beholders.
	-First, though, we opted to explore the hole the beholder emerged from.
		-Stairs led downward, but were blocked by rubble only a short ways in.
		-However, a wand lay on the floor there.
			-Caltor, with the help of a scroll, identified it as a Wand of Gaseous form and, looked
			 significantly at the gaps in the rubble.
		-Employing the wand and now gaseous, we drifted through the blockage, finding ourselves in
		 a series of half flooded passages.
		-Down one branch, we found a large, artificial cave, featuring an enormous spider statue,
		 and an altar to Lloth.
			-Still gaseous, Shiv drifted out over the deeper water, exploring.
			-Investigating the altar, he managed to spring a trap, but one harmless to his gaseous
			 form.
			-It _did_, however, seem to awaken something in the water, as tentacles briefly broke
			 the surface.
			-Shiv returned to us after that, and a kraken then tried to force it's beak down the
			 tunnel after him, but could not fit.
			-We explored the rest of the flooded tunnels, finding nothing but some art of Drow
			 warring against nearly everyone, eventually dieing by volcano.
			-Caltor and Shiv were quite insistent on poking the kraken, though (with his wand of
			 Dominate), so we ventured back to it's chamber.
			-Caltor excitedly proposed shooting an electrical arrow into the water, and I volunteered
			 to take the shot, now being immune to electricity.
			-That certainly pissed the kraken off, and it tried again to reach us in the tunnel, but
			 Caltor dominated it.
			-It then provided us a tour of it's chamber, finding some loot.
				-Including a spider-motif-covered dagger that, aside from it's combat abilities, is
				 apparently the key to a "touchstone site".
				-A touchstone site can grant a minor magical ability, or a greater one if some quest
				 is undertaken.
					-Seems likely worth finding the one the corresponds to our dagger.
					-You can only attune to one at a time, though.
		-Branching off from that chamber, we found another one, containing some kind of nightmare 
		 mantis monster, which briefly glanced up at us, but then returned to munching on bones.
			-Caltor tried to dominate it, to no avail, but really getting it's attention.
			-Fortunately, it actually had a proposition for us, rather than hunger for us.
			-Summoned by the drow, it was trapped there, and asked us to free it, offering in return
			 to kill three enemies, coming to us when called by name to do so.
			-He introduced himself as Azimaxus, The Devourer of Bones.
			-We agreed, and Caltor dispelled the wards, releasing it.
				-They'll come back, being permanently inscribed in the stone, but it was enough.
		-We then went in search of the touchstone site, fairly certain it was our giant spider alter.
			-And, sure enough, approaching the magic circle before the alter _with the dagger in
			 hand_, it glowed blue rather than the red of the trap, and granted Caltor permenant
			 spider climb, soon followed by Arvaec and Shiv as well.
			-The statue also had writing on it, in Elvish and Dwarvish both.
				-We could only read the Elvish portion, and it was also worn, but we made out:
				 "Eight halves" "Objects that need to be somehow activated."
			-We had Caltor write down the Dwarven runes, for later translation.
				-It uses the same alphabet as Gnomish, after all.
			-There are also images of _three_ thuribles being used, including the one we found.
				-Ours is spider themed, but the other two have hammer and bat theming.
					-Dwarves and Desmodu? Ours being the Drow?
					-Ours is the Thruible of Retribution.
		-The area pacified, and a Dominated kraken prowling the waters, we opted to rest here.


5/28/21:
	-We headed to Bendar's Desmodu encampment.
	-Part of the path did indeed plunge into a depression full of toxic volcanic vapors.
		-Caltor and Shiv donned the gas masks we bought from the Desmodu merchants, while Arvaec
		 strode in unafraid.
			-Caltor: "Am I the only one who is just a normal gnome or whatever?"
			 Arvaec: "None come back from death unchanged. . ."
		-There was a great deal of water vapor as well.
			-It soon became clear to us the source of it, as we heard some water rushing toward a
			 glow in the mist. It seemed to be a waterfall rushing into a source of great heat.
			-The heat source blocked our path. However, with my newly keener senses, and eyes
			 untroubled by the scalding steam, I could see a dark band, seemingly swaying.
			-We sent the gnome in first, and he managed to identify the band as a spell effect, a
			 quasi-real bridge of shadow, and our path forward.
				-It seemed to be unstable, though, flickering in and out of reality, and moving to
				 and frow. Caltor knew, though, that it could be stabilized briefly by feeding it
				 the power of one of his spells.
				-It led through a force effect which was (mostly) holding back a great cascade of
				 magma, some of which was overflowing and mixing with the water.
	-The path from there was flanked by statues of great Desmodu warriors, and decorated with
	 reliefs depicting their battles with the drow.
		-The fine craftsmenship could have been dwarven make, if not for strange patterns of 
		 texture unlike anything we'd seen. The textured pieces seemed to be worn from the
		 touch of many creatures.
			-Out of character, we'd recognize a braille-like system of writing.
	-There was also a great pool flanking the path ahead, and in it, immense mounds of gold!
		-It appeared to be comprised of large, worked chunks, apparently pieces of a shattered statue.
		-Looking into the pool, we spotted the statue's base, which appeared to have writing on it.
			-We could make out bits of Elvish, Dwarvish, and Draconic, along with one other we did
			 not recognize.
			-Arvaec strode into the water, to get a closer look.
			-It proved deeper than we'd thought, though, and Arvaec slipped down a rock slope 60' or
			 more deep.
			-The statue went all the way down, and appeared to be the bottom half of a dragon, the
			 top presumably demolished.
			-Closer to it now, I could read the writing on the intact half of the statue.
				-Each scale recorded a deed.
				-The elvish bits talked of being bound to a kingdom, with a name mixing all four
				 languages. It was in a dialect, though, that Arvaec associates with the drow.
				-The Draconic bits recorded deed done to defend the kingdom.
			-Now that Arvaec was deeper into the pool, he also spotted three limp eyestalks and a
			 spear protruding from some rubble and debris nearby.
				-Approaching it, and going so far as to grasp one of the stalks with his touch
				 attack, Arvaec confirmed the beholder was dead of a very many wounds.
				-Keen eyed, Arvaec also noticed some damage to it's _tongue_.
					-It seeemed a symbol had been burned there, a hand print with, in its center,
					 an eye with nine rays coming from it, and a chain.
						-Arvaec recognized it as a symbol of Io, but one reputed to be used by
						 _humans_.
						-Indeed, the hand print was bigger than that of an elf, but not so stubby
						 as a dwarf's meaty palm.
			-Having seen what he came to, Arvaec performed a Sending, contacting Caltor and asking
			 that he lower a cave to help Arvaec out of the steep-side pool.
	-Apparently while Arvaec was in the pool, Caltor and Shiv made some more winged friends.
		-One of the Desmodu was offering to take us to Bendar, if we would peace-bond our weapons
		 and our ring and middle fingers (to prevent spellcasting).
		-Caltor tried to pull some shit with Suggestion, to no avail, but the Desmodu, Mekmeht,
		 was only minimally offended, and still took us to Bendar once we'd bound ourselves.
	-Mekmeht led us to a nearby cave, lined with openings in use as dwellings and filled with a
	 variety of tents and other structures.
		-Around us, looking on, were Desmodu of various ages, looking on.
		-He led us to a shrine, featuring a large stylized bat statue, and chasm.
		-Mekmeht told us we needed to clamber down into the chasm with our cables, to reach Bendar's
		 chamber without wings.
		-We reassured him we had other options, and then Spider Climbed down into the chasm.
	-There, we finally met Bendar.
		-We told him we'd come in search of the beholders seen on the surface, and the we were told
		 he'd help the caravan in distress.
		-Arvaec also said that it seemed his tribe had encountered and slain one of them themselves.
			-Though his advisor and translator seemed reluctant to do so, Bendar conveyed to us that
			 it was not in fact them that had slain the beast.
			-Instead, a mysterious figure arrived and slew the beholder. He called himself Cuculain,
			 and _said he was a human!_
				-Cal had heard recent rumors of a man with a massive sword and blue dragonscale armor
				 by the name.
			-He slew the beholder, deflecting it's eye rays with a mirrored shield, and harming it
			 terribly when it tried to swallow him.
				-Sounds like that Io mark was a wound, then, rather than a brand. . .
			-In return, he demanded resources and aid from the Desmodu, and that they _not help
			 those that serve dragons._
				-"He believed himself above us."
		-Bendar asked for help, his people being in conflict with the salamanders as the smiths had
		 told us. They needed either the conflict solved or new, safer territory.
			-Once allies, they had supplied metals to the salamanders, but their mines had run dry.
			-The great alliance also included drow and dwarves, and the golden statue had been of
			 their protector, but, with it's disappearance, they soon fell to strife.
			-The salamanders, attempting to drive them off, were the source of the magma at the
			 entrance, rerouted as a weapon.
			-Arvaec offered that we had encountered some salamander smiths in the service of the
			 beholder we slew at Cael-Rekshaar, who had told us of the conflict.
			-He also offered that his lord Sszythrach had mining interests, as well as territory,
			 and that we could negotiate with the salamanders.
			-Bendar accepted, and asked that we swear to aid them, which we did. In return, he would
			 offer us aid, and warn or help us if the human was again sighted.
			-He also offered us a trade, our Ring of Waterwalking, apparently once used by their
			 people, for a relic of the alliance, what proved to be the Thurible of Divining:
			 https://discord.com/channels/759886843801239603/759886844258943039/848030697453256704
				-So we of course said yes. Good on it's own, and it's the second key to the
				 touchstone's greater power.
	-Bendar offered food and rest in their encampment, which we accepted. That night, though, as
	 Caltor and Shiv rested, Arvaec, unsleeping, saw their spirits lift from their body.
		-He quickly used Lesser Telepathic Bond to contact Cal, who appeared to be dreaming of the
		 of the catastrophe that shattered the ancient alliance.
		-A dragon, that dreaming-Cal identified Exodon, one of the council-liches.
		-In the dream, all of the council races were present, with dwarves riding lesser gold dragons,
		 when Exodon attacked his kin, with many of the lesser races falling as collatoral damage.
		-He then collected the skulls of his kin. No great surprise, given the lich he became.
	-Upon seeing Bendar in the morning, he haltingly indicated in Draconic that he knew we all, his
	 tribe included, had the dream.
		-He pointed to the empty jug, from the food last night (that Arvaec wisely mimed drinking,
		 albeit more to conceal his own state).
		-We volunteered that we knew of the dragon, their erstwhile protector, and why he had
		 betrayed them, in search of his lichdom. We told them that we had destroyed his phylactory.
		-Bendar was still saddened at the dragon's destruction, but hoped it meant his rebirth, free
		 of the evil that plagued him.
	-We decided to perform some Divinations:
		-"What can we do to make peace between the Salamanders and the Desmodu?"
			-"Stop the flow of the magma from the Salamanders to the Desmodu."
		-"Where is the blue armored dragonslayer Cuculain?
			-"He stands before the house of the mountain kings."
			-That's on our world map, nearby.
	-With supplies from the Desmodu, we set out along the path they told us would lead to the
	 Salamanders, though it was several days journey.
	-Reaching them uneventfully, we encountered some Salamanders at work in a magma filled chasm,
	 collecting metals.
		-At the sight of us, though, one fled, screaming that, "The ones who slew the smiths of
		 Cael-Rekshaar have come!"
			-Uh oh. Has the human been spreading lies here as well?
		-One stood his ground, though, said we would not get past him.
			-Trying to calm him, he claimed we had frozen the smiths, and sent their heads back to
			 the Salamanders.
			-He claimed, though, no human had been here, poisoning them against us.
	-We soon found who _did_ likely like to them, when a beholder emerged from deeper in the
	 chamber, dismissing the Salamander.
		-Cal pestered it with questions, but we learned little of value.
		-That eventually provoked it into attacking us.
		-It got a bunch of rays off at Caltor, who thankfully weathered them.
		-When it came to Arvaec's turn, he thought to himself, what would Sszythrach do?
			-The answer came easy, and Arvaec called out to Tiamat, wishing Destruction upon his
			 enemy. She answered.
		-The beholder's mouth contained a pair of ioun stones and the Thurible of Warding:
		 https://discord.com/channels/759886843801239603/759886844258943039/848054185336635392
	-With the beholder dead, the Salamanders were freed from what was apparently straight up mind
	 control.
	-With that settled, the Salamanders and Desmodu both were willing to join the cause of our
	 dragons back at The Rookerie.
		-The Salamanders took up residence near Sszythrach's increasingly volcanic lair beneath The
		 Rookerie.
			-They brought their forge equipment with, and were quite interested in the precious
			 metals of the salvaged dragon hoards.
		-The Desmodu also came to help with the restoration of The Rookerie.
			-They constructed new perimeter defenses, helped with salvaging hoards, and even set up
			 a network of bat-riding scouts, to keep watch for ships.
	-Next session, 5 years later, the dragons awaken.
		-In the intervening time, we learn that Cuculain had caused a civil war amongst the dwarves,
		 with some factions joining the dragonslayer.
		-The tribes of The Painted Ones, elves in the North of the islands, there's been word of another
		 blue-armored dragonslayer.
		-There have even been rumors of attacks on isolated dragons by the dragonslayer and dwarven allies.


-TODO:
	-Give Sszythrach HD skills for his +2 to Int, since that's how Lesley has been running it.
		-Done!
	-Update macros.
		-Looks like theat's done for Arvaec (the only thing needed for the cohort sessions) and for
		 Sszythrach's unbuffed attacks, but you need to set up the buffed ones.
		-Done!


7/23/21:
	-The map now has symbols indicating what area's feature what races.
		-The Painted Ones are a kind of wild elf, barbarians known for their blue woad paint that
		 can magically protect them from harm.
	-Both Salamanders and Desmodu have come to settle at The Rookerie.
	-The Dwarves, meanwhile, had closed their cities, expelling dragons and lesser races sympathetic
	 to The Council.
		-Rumors have since spread that they are harboring humans!
		-A human with a massive axe has been seen wandering near The House of the Mountain King,
		 dressed in blue dragonscale armor.
		-Between there and The Celestial Observatory, a human woman was seen with dwarven generals,
		 also dressed in blue dragonscale armor. Undead attacks followed in their wake.
	-We've also heard rumors of the kidnapping of dragons, and their sacrifice.
		-Apparently the rest of the clutch had witnessed something similar, before I met them,
		 perpetrated by "squid-elves".
			-Connected, I presume, to the now-gone corruption that plaqued the traitor-wyrms?
	-All these blue scales had me wondering, had anyone heard from the Blue clans lately?
		-Caltor, despite almost no exposure to human culture, had heard rumors from ancient dragons,
		 who could remember the first human war, of humans forging armor from especially powerful
		 dragons they felled, passing them down through their dragon hunting lodges, as a marker of
		 status and nobility.
			-Sszythrach: "It's well they mark their leaders so brightly. It's rather sporting of them. . ."
	-Starfire checked in with his shadow elf spies.
		-They had observed dwarves, industrious as ever, but working on the _surface_.
		-In the forest between The Celestial Observatory and The House of the Mountain King they were
		 collecting a strange, green-ish stone from the near the surface.
		-They were using it to construct a castle, but each stone placed _floats_, a foot or two off
		 the ground, resulting in a floating castle.
		-Caltor had actually heard of such stone, collected, apparently, from "the bottom of the world".
			-Deep within The Underdark, it's rumored you can reach caverns opening to empty, endless
			 sky.
			-There, it is said great, upside-down mountains of this green stone exist, holding up the
			 world.
	-Shit! We overslept! We're now Young Adults!
		-We're skipping an age category, as a result of a mixup on Lesley's end.
		-No wonder the damned place is infested with humans now.
		-We then spent a bunch of time leveling up further.
	-We decided that, of the dragonslayer's we'd heard of, the one raising an undead army seemed the
	 greatest threat to the isle as a whole, and attempted to (Greater) Scry her.
		-Arvaec beat her will save, and saw a woman garbed in blue dragon scale armor, with a dragon
		 bone sickle
			-The sickle had a blue glint, with veins of copper throughout, suggesting a similar origin
			 to the armor.
		-She stood in a cave with seemingly enslaved dwarves all around her.
		-Before her, there lay many eggs, and several dwarven slaves, dead of gaping cavities in their
		 chests.
		-While we watched, one of the standing slaves fell forward, a hideous insectoid creature emerged
		 bloodily from his chest.
			-We later saw more slaves dragged to the eggs, which promptly hatched, smaller creatures
			 emerging and grappling with the faces of the screaming slaves.
			-The freshly emerged, larger creature seemed to stare at the woman, and responded when she
			 used a whistle.
				-It seemed to submit to and obey her.
			-Cal had heard legends of an ancient superweapon, predating the dragon wars, tied to The
			 Blood War, monsters resembling this creature.
				-Unsure whether it's the name of the creatures, their creator, or what, Cal did know
				 the name "Kython", associated with them.
		-We heard her soldiers call her "Mistress Teysa".
			-The one we saw bore the symbol of Clan Mithralmane, the clan that in ancient times dug
			 out The Mithralmane, but modified by a mark resembling a bloody human handprint.
				-The same symbol, in fact, that we saw branded into the tongue of that dead beholder,
				 by another of these dragon slayers.
		-We also saw Teysa touch many of the slaves as she walked by, each looking paler after.
			-A Spellcraft check suggested she was embedding some species of necromantic growth in
			 them.
		-While we watched, she then looked straight at the magical sensor, asking us if we liked
		 what we saw. . .
		-As we continued watching, we saw her listen to something we could not hear, then saying,
		 "Ah yes, it has arrived."
			-At which point, we could suddenly hear screams outside Tiamat's temple at The Rookerie.
			-Sszythrach: "There are foes at our gates! Come, let us show them what we're made of!"
	-Outside, there lay various corpses of the lesser races, and three of the insectoid beasts,
	 albeit larger and. . . bladier than the ones scried.
		-The three immediately outside the temple fell immediately to Sszythrach's breath, but more
		 screams could be heard in the distance.
		-Dokinanth flew off with Clator on his back, off to battle another group of them.
			-Cal managed to Dominate one, but not until after another had clawed Dokinanth.
			-Dokinanth failed a Fortitude save and felt the bite of a terrible burning acid in the
			 wound.
				-Dokinanth suffered more of the same when he bit one of them. This proved a trend,
				 repeating each time we injured them.
				-One even lept onto Sszythrach's face, rendinging open _its own abdomen_, spraying
				 him with a great quantity of their acidic blood.
		-Several other groups of them rampaged throughout the area as well.
		-From his dominated one, Clator got the sense that these things could not see, but could
		 feel vibrations. . .
		-Arvaec hit a pair of them with a Flame Strike. The fire of Tiamat's wrath did not seem to
		 be all that effective, but the _divine_ portion of it seemed _especially_ so.
		-Cold too did not seem to phase the beast.
			-The dragonslayer's chose a wise weapon. . .
		-Eventually, they all fell before us, as all foes must, save the dominated one.
		-That one, Caltor established a telepathic link with, for it seemed without language.
			-He saw visions of a version of the creature 3 times it's size, associated with some
			 kind of breeding ritual.
			-He also saw the red bearded human with the enormous axe, clearly in this vision made
			 of dragon vertebrae, whom the creature respected and admired.
			-Terming it wild and impossible to tame, Caltor began to whip the dominated creature to
			 death, but Starfire stayed his hand. Not, though, from mercy, but to eat it's soul,
			 after which it rose as a spectral spawn.
				-Quite the new trick!
	-That finished, I decided a Sending was in order, to Teysa
		-"You chose a wise weapon, but grossly underestimated us. I, Sszythrach, will destroy you,
		 your family, your nation, and your people."
		-She repsonded in a like manner (somewhat impressive. . .) and did not seemed cowed, to no
		 great surprise. She claimed they were but a distraction, one that allowed her to complete
		 her citadel.
			-She'll soon learn there's not a wall built, floating or not, that can stop Sszythrach's
			 wrath. . .


-TODO:
	-More undead, now that you're two age categories advanced!
		-Collect xenomorph corpses?
			-Raised it here: https://discord.com/channels/759886843801239603/759886844258943039/868981857818116116
			-We did so, and got 2 juvenile ones and 3 adults.
		-Plenty of more mundane ones now too. . .


7/26/21:
	-We gathered up our new corpses and returned to the scrying chamber by the temple to Tiamat.
		-Gazing into the pool, our foe was still at the castle.
		-Starfire disappeared while we were focused on it, as he's wont to do (Jeff ended up busy
		 this evening).
	-We thoroughly buffed ourselves, and then quickly teleported to our foe, now inside a room at
	 the castle.
		-Dokinanth opened the assault by attempting to curse her, but to no avail.
		-We were all invisible, but she was subject to some horrible necromantic spell. Her guts
		 hung from her armor, writhing, and bits of them even dropped off attempting to attack
		 invisible Sszythrach!
			-Though it did not manage much harm through his thick scales, but latched on in some
			 fashion, which surely isn't good.
		-Finally, buffed-huger-but-now-slow Sszythrach finally breathed his dread breath.
			-The woman came well prepared, though. As crackling volcanic desctruction washed over
			 her, a great diamond embedded in her wrist began to sparkle. . .
			-Caltor was quick (_impossibly_ quick, via spells) and managed to intervene, countering
			 her defense.
				-So quick, in fact, that Sszythrach didn't even notice the aid, and claims the
				 victory himself.
	-With our foe dead (though Caltor had some doubts, as of yet unsure what the ring was about),
	 we swept down from (what turned out to be) the top of the floating tower, clearing the rooms
	 of a necromantic horror as we went.
		-In one room, Arvaec stumbled on a grisly scene, the well dressed but disembowled corpse of
		 a dwarf. Around it were scattered various plants and implements, which Arvaec recognized,
		 strangely, as an example of ancient wild elven magic. An odd thing for dwarves _or_ humans
		 to be involved with. . .
	-On a balcony below, Sszythrach could hear more movement inside a doorway and, catching sight of
	 a blue-scale-armored arm, unleashed a Sound Burst.
		-Charging through the doorway in response, we recognized the figure as the rumored Cuculain,
		 another of our hated dragon-slayer foes.
		-He struck Sszythrach with a blow from his enormous axe, leaving a gash in even mighty
		 Sszythrach's stony scales.
		-Hearing the noise of battle, Arvaec rushed out a door and down some stairs to join his master,
		 wishing Destruction upon his foe.
			-Like his identically armored companion, Cuculain bore great diamonds inset in jewelry,
			 sparkling in response to the spell.
			-This time, Cal wasn't quick enough, though he tried, and Cuculain resisted the spell.
		-Not to be deterred, Sszythrach sought to rend him apart with a full attack, which seemed to
		 go quite well, only for a second (of two) diamonds to restore him as he neared death.
		-He responded with quite formidable full attack himself, though Arvaec closed those wounds
		 moments later.
		-We traded more blows, with Cal mixing in a blast of cold and some other trickery, but he was
		 wearing badly.
		-With a bad swing, his half-frozen leg cracked, but still he fought on, even through a rain
		 of blows from Dokinanth too.
		-It (_it_ now) fought on through all of this, well past what any living thing could have
		 surivived, seeming sustained only by rage, until it finally tore itself apart in one last
		 attack.
	-With that, we continued our sweep down through the tower.
		-In one room on the next level, Caltor found a shrine to Io.
			-It heavily featured a 9 headed dragon motif, including a statue of Io and his holy
			 symbol.
			-It _also_ seemed to apply Restoration every turn to those within it.
			-In response to Sszythrach's comment that it's odd the humans follow Io too, Caltor
			 mentioned that Io was said to have created the first dragonhunters, to force The Council
			 together and to end the dragon wars.
				-Arvaec added that, given the conflict currently at hand among dragons, it is no
				 surprise they've returned.
				-From what Arvaec knew of their doctrine, they believe Io has tasked them with the
				 destruction of _all_ dragons.
		-Scattered throughout the place was also the corpses of seemingly every dwarf noble that had
		 allied themselves with the necromancer, all tortured and slaughtered in the same ritualistic
		 manner as the first one found.
			-All 6 we saw through the scrying pool were accounted for among them.
			-It was _not_ the work of the chestbursters.
	-Dokinanth was able to locate the xenomorph queen we'd seen in visions with a spell. It was down
	 in the basement beneath us. . .
		-Flying down to a convenient balcony protruding from the floating rock on which the tower
		 was anchored, we could indeed see the creature in the tunnels beyond.
		-It seemed frustrated, scrabbling at the hard rock walls of it's chamber, as if intent on
		 escape, taking no notice of us in it's frantic quest.
		-Caltor attempted to read it's mind, but it managed to resist.
		-It did seem to react to our speech, seemingly. . . curious, but without understanding.
		-Dokinanth attempted some True Name weirdness, to reach the creature and perhaps even bind
		 it to service.
			-In response, it clawed at it's own neck, and runic symbols that briefly glinted around
			 it's neck. It seems it is already bound in some fashion. . .
			-Nonetheless, Dokinanth established a measure of communication with the creature.
				-In stuttering visions, he could see it's interest in mothering it's brood, that
				 brood slaying demons and devils both, and, asking it who it served, a vision of it
				 shredding the (now-dead) necromancer.
				-It seems mostly interested in it's own violent reproduction.
				-It seemed, though, to also know the squid elves, viewing them too as a kind of
				 hated master.
					-They controlled the creatures with some kind of glowing stones. . .
		-Though Sszythrach cautioned against it, Dokinanth seemed intent on playing with this fire,
		 so Sszythrach had Arvaec attempt to bring the horror to heel.
			-To no avail, though, as it resisted the spell, and several more castings from Caltor's
			 wand.
			-Dokinanth, finally convinced the beast was uncontrollable, turned it over to
			 Sszythrach's mercy.
		-Stepping over it's ashes, we explored the late queen's chambers.
			-Within, we found a mithral doored chamber. It's walls were covered in images, seemingly
			 carved by the beast itself (claw marks, acid, etc.), and it's floor in eggs.
			-They depicted squid elves emerging from a crater, and forcing dwarves, elves, and
			 humans to kneel before these creatures' eggs.
			-The crater, in fact, seemed to resemble one we could see in the landscape far beneath
			 the fortress, one from which even now dwarves were dragging more of their enslaved
			 fellows.


8/4/21:
	-We'd seen evidence of some of the dwarven generals being raised as wights, and think that the
	 "dwarves" seen below still doing the bidding of the humans may be more such.
	-In sweeping the rest of the fortress, we found a dwarf corpse unlike the others, where something
	 had broken open it's _skull_.
		-Dokinanth and Starfire had apparently seen similar wounds before Sszythrach joined them, on
		 a pirate ship where, through object reading magic, Dokinanth had determined that blue armored
		 humans had been present.
	-After we completed, our search of the castle, Starfire appeared.
		-He'd apparently been working with his spy network in search of more shards of the sword of
		 Io (Jeff couldn't make last session).
		-He believes he's found the locations of both the Divination and Enchantment shards.
			-The Enchantment one lies on The Isle of the Mad.
			-The Divination one is at The Oracle, protected by a great gold dragon.
			-He and Dokinanth already held Evocation and Necromancy, respectively.
		-We caught him up on our end of things too.
	-Huh. An off hand mention by Dokinanth let Sszythrach know that Dokinanth had apparently managed
	 to mangle most of the planar dragon council with poorly weilded truename magic, transmuting them
	 into horrors.
		-So there's a power vacuum amongst the planar dragons as well. Interesting. . .
	-There were four holes in the terrain below us, all but one of which had dwarven slaves emerging
	 from them.
		-From two of them, the slaves went out to collect surface minerals.
		-From one, though, a long line of slaves emerged. They were lead to the fourth hole, directly
		 beneath the floating citadel, and were being forced into it.
		-Sszythrach wished to bring swift destruction to his foes, starting immediately, but the
		 others counciled caution, and said that tiny Caltor was fatigued and needed rest.
			-Accustomed to the weakness of the lesser races, Sszythrach assented, acknowledging that
			 we may also require new spells to fit him into these caves.
		-They also wished to send someone ahead to scout, a task for which shadow-y Starfire and tiny
		 Caltor volunteered. Starfire flew Cal down and, finding the hole narrow even for his runty
		 self, Starfire tossed Cal in.
			-The hole opened into a volcanic-looking tunnel, leading to a frozen "river" of obsidian.
			-The slaves were being chained to cables anchored in the stone walls, and then forced
			 to follow the cables deeper into the tunnel.
			-The guards, matching the dead leaders above, bore a tatoo of a dwarven face, the mark
			 of Clan Mithralmane, apparently our traitors.
			 along those steel paths, deeper into the gound.
			-We'd seen the patriarch of the clan, dead above, so Caltor attempted a deception, taking
			 his form.
			-Starfire, though, had witnessed more of the Kythons (xenomorphs) pouring into the hole
			 behind Cal, and squeezed in after, to warn him.
			-Seizing Cal as the casting of Alter Self revealed his previously invisible self, Starfire
			 alerted Cal to the Kythons creeping down the tunnel behind him, and then flew them both
			 back towards the entrance, beneath the Kythons scurrying along the tunnel's ceiling.
			-Not wanting to waste his illusion, though, Caltor shouted over his shoulder, "It's a
			 trap! Run! They'll kill us all!", successfully sowing quite a bit of chaos.
			-They returned from there to the rest of us, relaying the news.
		-Sszythrach finally got his way and we went off to visit destruction upon our enemies.
			-Dokinanth widened the hole, and we could hear the screeches of the Kython in response.
			-Sszythrach scurried down into the tunnel, and blasted the crowd Kythons at the bottom.
				-Not one could stand before his breath.
			-He then led the way deeper into the tunnel.
			-We came to a group of chained dwarven slaves, emaciated and clearly held captive for
			 a great length of time.
				-Cal offered them some rations, while Sszythrach barked questions at them.
				-We learned they were also of Clan Mithralmane, and claimed they'd been "loyal" (to
				 their treacherous leaders), but had been chained nonetheless.
					-Sszythrach lectured them on the wages of treachery against their _true_ masters,
					 but mercifully decided they'd been punished enough.
					-One volunteered that some dwarves in the capitol, apparently of more stalwart
					 stuff, still were actively resisting.
				-We asked them where the slaves were being taken, and they said they'd seen many
				 slaves led into these tunnels, but few returning, all of which bore strange eggs. . .
				-Sszythrach yanked from the wall the cable they were chained to, freeing them, saying,
				 "Be glad your treachery will be met with mercy on this day! Go, free the other
				 captives, and carry 
			-Deeper in the tunnels, walls of strange metal met the rock, leading to chambers filled
			 with strange machinery.
				-In one such chamber stood dwarves of Clan Mithralmane, armed with crossbows, but
				 not reacting to us.
				-They were seemingly enscrolled.
				-Dokinanth reached out to their minds.
					-He saw visions of a craft, made of this same strange metal, floating in a star-
					 studded void.
					-He also saw visions of chambers, seemingly within it, containing figures somewhat
					 like the squid elves they'd encountered, though taller, four-fingered (rather
					 than five) and of somewhat more. . . octopus-like features.
					-And of another, containing a great, tentacled brain in a tank, devouring smaller
					 brains.
					-And then, of conflict amongst the tentacled humanoids, one stabbing another,
					 and then cracking open an egg in the great brain's tank, which went red, and
					 then of the Kython queen emerging from it, followed by a sensation of falling.
					-And now of the blue armored humans, seemingly discovering what now seemed to be
					 _this_ craft. The figures we'd seen were there, but also a very young girl,
					 though one covered in scars and bearing a spear and a sword with a dragon wing
					 crossguard. In the vision, they chained the queen.
					-Finally, he saw one of the squid creatures emerging from an armoire-like
					 container, perhaps having hidden from the humans.
					-He also then heard a voice, seemingly directed at him: "If you are here to
					 attempt to kill me, you would not be the first. But if, as I suspect, you are
					 here to kill the humans, you will find in me a valuable alley."
						-Dokinanth, skilled at such things, detected no lie.
				-Coming to, he relayed all of this the rest of us.
				-Dokinanth then spoke to one of the enscrolled dwarves, saying, "Voice, can you hear
				 me?"
					-The dwarf convulsed, but then did indeed respond.
					-This creature was indeed interested in negotiating an alliance against the
					 humans.
					-Dokinanth tried to get it to reveal itself, but it claimed doing so would allow
					 the humans to find it.
					-He attempted to reassure it that we had slain two of the three blue armored
					 figures, all save the little girl, but it claimed she was the most dangerous
					 of the three.
						-It said she had gathered many weapons from this ship, that she meant to use
						 against The Rookerie.
						-An army follwed her in this, and she believed herself invincible, beneath
						 the banner of the dragon god Io.
						-What it feared most, though, was that, with the resources and slaves she
						 would seize, she would dig up this ship as well, posing a great threat to
						 itself.
						-The girl, in believing herself invincible, left her dreams open to the
						 creature.
						-If we would swear to not return to this place, it was willing to share that
						 information with us.
							-Pressed further as to why it wished that, it claimed only to want to
							 live out it's (unending) days in solitude.
							-Dokinanth wanted more, though, and wished to know of the outer realms
							 it had seen, to perhaps correspond with it in some way.
							-It volunteered that the only way to leave "this crystal sphere" (?) was
							 with the "Spelljammer drive", contained on this ship. It would give it to
							 us, if only we would assent to it's bargain.
						-This struck us as a reasonable bargain, and we assented.
						-It then told us that the weapons the girl had armed herself with required
						 special orbs to work fully, a fact she did not know, orbs which it had,
						 and gave to us by somehow teleporting it into the possessed dwarf's hand.
							-One would allow us to control the energy-ballistas she had taken,
							 instead of her.
							-The other would allow control over a bioweapon that she was using to
							 create monsters from the dwarves.
								-"The Kythons", Dokinanth asked? "Yes, it will control any existing
								 Kython, albeit with a limited range of about 60 feet."
									-Though, on a moonless night, that apparently extends to 300',
									 owing some interaction with the sun and moon of this world.
									-The use of it, though, required care, lest the user's mind be
									 overcome by that of the Kython hivemind.
						-Questioned as to the drive, it said it would have it's enscrolled slaves
						 bring it to the surface.
						-As we then sought to hurry back to The Rookerie, the voice offered to send
						 us there, and we accepted it's Teleport.
	-Back at The Rookerie, we hurried to ready it's defenses.
		-Starfire recieved a vision of the assault shortly after arrived, of ships at midnight,
		 blanketing the waters, an endless mass.
		-If that (rather mysterious) vision is occurring _tonight_, we have a mere 9 hours to prepare.
			-We readied The Rookerie's defenses, and called up our soldiers, setting patrols in boats
			 (and in the form of my wraiths and shadows) to watch the coast.
			-Dokinanth and Starfire employed Weather Control, to make the trip difficult with fog and
			 sleet.
	-Indeed, just before midnight, lights were spotted on the horizon, and the sound of drum beats
	 and oars could be heard on the water.
		-The bad weather slowed them, and disarrayed the ships, with some even foundering.
		-Soon, though, gouts of flame were also seen, as a Colossal gold dragon was sighted, soon 
		 joined by a similarly sized blue and green, and they strafed the ships.
			-The blue and green were dragons Dokinanth and Starfire recognized, having once mediated
			 a dispute between them.
			-A black also lept from the water, joining the battle with gouts of acid, and then a great
			 silver dragon also emerged from a cloudbank.
			-Finally, a great tentacled silhouette appeared in the fog briefly.
				-Perhaps aid from our indebted storm god?
		-Around the same time, Starfire got a strange look in his eyes, and then suddenly burst with
		 light, glowing like a beacon.
			-He said he'd seen a vision of the girl on the way to The Rookerie's amphitheater,
			 accompanied by Painted Ones.
	-We rushed to the amphitheater, to slay the girl and strike the head from her army.
		-We did indeed find the girl there, along with nearly a dozen Painted Ones and three of the
		 strange ballistas.
		-Dokinanth unleashed a Storm of Vengeance on the field, later followed by a Whirlwind, but
		 the girl ran through it, straight at us, darting so quickly we could not strike at her,
		 and ending up right between Sszythrach and Dokinanth.
		-Perhaps she is wise in Sszythrach's ways, and wished to use his companions as living
		 shields, to stay his wrath.
		-It was to no avail, though, as Sszythrach tumbled back and threw himself into the air above
		 her, breathing pinpoint destruction down upon her.
		-Shockingly, she weathered it! Though Sszythrach, learning from her companions' wards, hardly
		 gave it his all, and in exchange could use it again the very next round.
		-Arvaec thought to show his master up, apparently, and even more shockingly, succeeded! She
		 began to crumble as his Destruction spell took effect.
			-The observant could see Sszythrach glaring at Arvaec.
		-Once more, though, a diamond embedded in a ring she wore began to sparkle, and Caltor again
		 sprang into magically fast action, pulling it from her finger, and leaving her to crumble
		 to ash.
		-Starfire, then, unleashed a Firestorm on the painted ones, leaving them (somewhat greasier)
		 ash as well.
	-With the leader fallen, the army remained.
		-Sszythrach, none too happy with Arvaec at the moment, grabbed him by the ankle and took wing.
		-Setting him down in admidst the settlement buildings around The Rookerie, Arvaec cast Death
		 Dragon and joined the street fighting, while Sszythrach flew on, to the nearest beached ship.
		-Flying from ship to ship, Sszythrach blasted the ships and crowds of soldiers with his breath.
		-The others visited similar devastation upon our enemies, Dokinanth with spell and breath
		 while Starfire drained the very life from them, some three hundred rising as spectors under
		 his control.
	-As the sun rose, broken survivors slowly crawled ashore, where they were met and offered death or
	 to submit to the will of the council.
	-Meanwhile, the five wyrms who came to our aid eventually came ashore, but busied themselves barking
	 orders to their servants, and then took wing.
		-That's where we're leaving off, also leaving (the fuckton of) loot for the next session.


TODO:
	-Speech:
		I have promised the humans my vengeance.
		Io has sent these creatures to unify his children. I say we gratefully accept his blessing! Let us indeed stand united. . . to bring war to these humans in their own countries. We will burn their cities and lay waste to their lands! The survivors will fear the skies for generations!
		Do not mistake this for _just_ sweet vengeance, though. This is truely a blessing from Io!
		War is a potent force for our unification, to be sure! However, humans cannot possibly stand before dragons long. Io, in his wisdom, would seem to have planned for this, though! When their nations fall, though, the _territory_ will remain. . .
		How much conflict among us is born from fights over wealth and territory? With these new vistas, that pressure will be eased! And, though we are mighty, I doubt even our kind could wipe humans from the land entirely, small and fast breeding as they are. If the more bellicose among us still find they crave conflict, they can satisfied for a millenia at least, digging the vestiges of humanity from their borrows to secure our new holdings.
		Io's offer to us here is as generous as it is wise. We'd be wise to accept it.


8/18/21:
	-Servants of the wyrms who arrived to our rescue came to speak with us.
		-They informed us that the wyrms were forming a new council, and were currently busy seeing
		 to their clans in light of this new order, but that they wished to speak to us in two weeks
		 time.
			-There goes the appetizing power vacuum. . .
			-The new council:
				Green - Blighttooth
				Blue - Glimmerscale
				Gold - Blaze Talons (Sheeredni-vaktar in Draconic)
				Silver - Winter Warden (Kuulvaysheniruss in Draconic)
				Amethyst - Stone Crested (Loexpersveksauriv in Draconic)
		-The servants of the wyrms also searched the human ships and corpses, taking anything of value,
		 and heaped it in the amphitheater where it was divided into shares for the various groups of
		 dragons that arrived to the battle.
	-Meanwhile, we returned to the buried ship, and salvaged our promised spelljammer helms with the
	 help of the voice.
		-We installed the whole drive system in the floating castle, and returned with it to The
		 Rookerie.
		-Treasure_for_dragons.odt has rules for the helms.
	-We also took some time to complete the saining of my name.
		-And inadvertently created a wild magic zone in one of The Rookerie's storerooms.
		-Dokinanth eventually completed the saining, though, and even then added a rune to my true
		 name, granting me _+1 base attack_.
	-Dokinanth also attempted the same with Starfire.
		-In the course of it, he managed to rip a hole in spacetime, sucking us all through to The
		 Elemental Plane of Earth.
			-We found ourselves in a vast cavern in which a huge crystal structure stood, attended
			 by various crystalline creatures that seemed to shed cold.
				-The others had heard of "Elemental Councils", and suspected this might be one such,
				 though what a "council" of mindless forces of nature means is unclear.
				-Starfire thought the crystals likely valuable, in part because of a psionic resonance
				 of some kind, but we opted to leave the creatures be for now.
		-The portal was two ways, though, (and not going anywhere, it seems) so we walked back
		 through it and completed the saining and granting him his own +1.
	-Dokinanth then set in on his own name.
		-Complete with another botch, swapping a big chunk of the store room with an equal section
		 of The Windswept Depths of Pandamonium.
			-It took the portal and a portion of the wild zone with, but specifically seemed to leave
			 living creatures behind, leaving us standing in a substantially craggier storeroom.
		-He did eventually complete his own name, and granted himself some skill points.
	-We then prepared for the arrival of this new council.
		-Starfire and Dokinanth had mentioned meeting the Green and Blue in the past, so Sszythrach
		 asked them about them.
			-They had settled a conflict between the two of them, over some servants taken by one
			 from the other, and had sided with the Blue. The two don't seem to care for one another,
			 and the Green likely is none to happy with my fellows, while the Blue is, and has aided
			 them in the past.
		-Sszythrach also asked them what they knew of the others.
			-Blaze Talons was the wyrm representative for the gold dragons on the old council.
			-Winter Warden was the wyrm representative for the silver dragons on the old council.
			-Stone Crested was the advocate of Clan Startail.
	-One by one, the wyrms arrived, and we were eventually brought before the council.
		-After quite a lot of waiting, and similar humiliations. . .
			-Actually quite a lot or ritualized humiliation. Sszythrach is going to remember the 
			 names of this new council.
		-Finally brought before them, Dokinanth questioned this ill treatment for the saviors of
		 The Rookerie, while Starfire asked them where _they_ were when the council betrayed us,
		 sullying the image of us all, by becoming profane dracolichs.
			-The Blue, Gold, Silver, and Amethyst all seemed suitably ashamed, but the Green was
			 deadset against us.
		-They claimed we had violated the law by pretending to the status of council members and
		 claiming the hoards of it's dead members, without consulting the wyrms of this land.
			-The Green apparently wanted our deaths, but the Blue suggested instead exile, to
			 which the rest had already agreed.
		-Sszythrach had little problem with this (though a big one to eventually resolve with the
		 wyrms). "This is not my home, and it seems the land is thoroughly unworthy of me."
			-Sszythrach made the first part of that speech:
				I have promised the humans my vengeance.
				Io has sent these creatures to unify his children. I say we gratefully accept his blessing! Let us indeed stand united. . . to bring war to these humans in their own countries. We will burn their cities and lay waste to their lands! The survivors will fear the skies for generations!
				Meanwhile, hide and squabble amongst yourselves. . 
	-The gave us two months to order our affairs and bring our followers and wealth with us.
		-Byond our followers, joining us on the journey would be:
			-The Desmodu and Salamanders.
			-The withered, comatose body of The Speaker.
			-Glimmerscale's circle of hags also joined us, claiming that it was fated to be so,
			 a thing they could see, but they did not know why.
				-Dokinanth was suspicous of one of them, though, and questioned her. She professed
				 a continued loyalty to Glimmerscale, and said that she would still be in contact
				 with him.
			-We were also joined by younger dragons who were sympathetic to Sszythrach's attempts
			 to rally them against the humans, in which he also enlisted the rest of the party.
				-Dokinanth took the lead on the speechifying, once Sszythrach brought him on board.
				-The dragons who agreed to come with us:
					Gold-4
					Silver-2
					Bronze-3
					Copper-4
					Brass-8
					Red-7+Profidious
					Blue-2
					Green-3
					White-8
					Black- 4
					Amathyst- 6
					Quartz- 6
					Emerald- 1
					Sapphire- 7
					Topaz- 4
				-d4 to determine age category, from hatchling (1) to juvenile (4).
					-We're previously acquainted with one of the Reds, Profidious.
					-Done and in Followers tab of spreadsheet
		-We'd be taking our floating castle with us, providing us a residence for the moment, though
		 it's _extremely_ crowded, with all of the above.
		-That just makes our next big question all the more urgent: Where to?
			-Though the dragons of this plane speak of other landmasses, little is known about them.
			-Dokinanth and Starfire at least knew of a cold land, populated by giants, far to the
			 South. Apparently The Keeper (?) had once tried to send them there, in search of true
			 name secrets and to find the source of the corruption, but they never went.
				-That's one option, at least.
			-What of the homeland of the humans?
				-We don't know where it is, but perhaps Divinations could tell?
				-Oh, another option presents itself! Dokinanth has managed to restore The Speaker,
				 through True Name workings.
					-Reacting to our exile from the isles, he said that we were a threat to the new
					 council, that our deeds meant their power was. . . insecure.
					-Asking us our intent now, we told him that we meant to strike back at the
					 humans that had plagued the isles in his absence.
						-He was unsurpised by their presence, and in fact claimed to have called
						 them!
						-He had discovered the council was corrupt, and had sent the girl we slew
						 dreams of the buried weapons in the desert. He meant to destroy the corrupt
						 council members.
						-At this, Dokinanth gestured to the drive system, speaking of our own salvage
						 from the ship, at which The Speaker's eyes widened.
						-He spoke excitedly of the wonderous places that might allow us to reach,
						 contrasting it with our (paltry, in his eyes) goal of human destuction.
						-Sszythrach insisted that he had made a promise, and asked The Speaker what
						 he knew of their homeland.
							-He said that the clan of dragon hunters that had attacked us was in fact
							 residing on the isles themselves, hidden amongst The Painted Ones for
							 centuries.
							-Blast! This exile has rendered them beyond our reach (for now). At very
							 least our enemies can plague one another.
						-We asked him then what he knew of travel to these other spheres.
							-He spoke of a creature brought here by the gods. One which destroyed the
							 human gods, though it was eventually bound, it's name broken. It's name
							 gone, it is now known as The Tarrasque, or "World Breaker".
							-The gods, it said, brought this creature from another crystal sphere.
							-The ark, then, in which they did so, the gods are said to have stored in
							 the sun.
						-We pressed him on the subject of navigating to these other spheres, and he
						 suggested investigating these other ships, the crashed one, or (and here he
						 seemed rather eager) the ark in the sun.
							-Sszythrach supposed he may be able to survive in even such a place. . .
							-How, then, could we reach the realm of the sun?
								-He was no longer sure, bereft of much of his memories as he was,
								 from prior to the breaking of his name.
							-Well then, Dokinanth attempted to restore his memories through true
							 naming, and met with success!
								-His memories restored, he spoke of stone tablets, found long ago by
								 his people, that told of the gods making a deal with illithids for
								 a ship, a spelljammer.
								-The realm of the sun must be plane shifted to, with it's focus being
								 a daidem of purest gold.
									-Which Dokinanth promptly miracled up from a handful of coins.
								-You then must sail a sea of golden flame to find an island, upon
								 which rests the wreckage of the ark.
	-Well, off to the sun.
		-Sszythrach plane shifted there alone, and indeed arrived in a sea of golden flames, boiling
		 like a cauldron.
		-The place managed to be hot even for Sszythrach.
		-Sszythrach took wing, and (somewhat languidly) flapped towards a land mass vaguely seen
		 in the distance.
		-Beneath me, creatures of living lava occasionally surfaced amidst the swiling flame, some
		 far larger than even Sszythrach imagined life could be.
		-Occasionally, Sszythrach saw mountains of magma and molten gold beneath him, the closest
		 thing to a solid surface on which to rest he saw, but Sszythrach's endurance is the stuff
		 of legend and he flew on.
		-Sszythrach flew for hours, as the island very gradually grew larger in the distance.
		-As it finally grew close, he could see something hovering over the island, outshining even
		 the sun beneath me, a great white light over the island.
		-As Sszythrach came close to the edge of the island, he could see the wreckage of the ark, an
		 improbably Noah-like craft to have survived the heat. It lay a few miles towards the center
		 of the island.
			-It was also broken open, with claw marks all around the opening.
		-Sszythrach could also see more clearly the source of the white light, a shining creature
		with six wings, skin of shining gold, blindfolded and with an absurdly large sword at it's
		waist.
			-Sszythrach recognized it as a kind of angel, though not a kind he knew.
			-As Sszythrach got to the edge of the island, it turned to look at him, despite it's
			 blindfold.
			-Sszythrach addressed it, with Tongues, asking who it was?
				-In answer he received a great cacophony, one which he eventually realized was many
				 languages at once, some of which he recognized.
				-Straining, he could just make out the strange speech.
			-Rather than an answer, he instead received a warning. It said the island was forbidden
			 by the gods, and that to approach would mean death.
			-It demanded Sszythrach leave this place, and asked what it would take to make that so.
				-Sszythrach explained he came in search of the knowledge to leave this crystal
				 sphere, and that he would happily leave with that in hand. Did the being have such
				 knowledge?
			-Seeing Sszythrach would not leave empty-handed, it drew it's blade and flew at him.
			-It was met with disintegration, but, in this particular instance, it felt like Sszythrach
			 was aided.
				-A storm rose around him, and amidst flame, ash, and green energy, his breath also
				 crackled with lightening. It would seem the not _all_ gods forbade this island, and
				 the storm god still stood with Sszythrach.
		-With that, Sszythrach began a search of the wreckage.
			-He spent four hours searching, but eventually heard a sound, not aloud, but in his mind.
			-It was a a repeating signal, seemingly of distress: "It has escaped! Run, if you can,
			 but please, help me!"
			-Sszythrach climbed inside the sundered ship, in search of the signal, and, after hours
			 of searching, came to a pedestal supporting an assemblage of glass tubes and machinery,
			 including a metal claw that thrashed and flailed.
				-Inside the largest of the tubes, a brain floated.
			-As he approached it closer, the signal in his mind changed, now seemingly addressing
			 him directly, in a plea fo aid.
				-"Who has left you here?"
					-Bahamut brought it here, venturing deep into the phlogiston to retrieve it,
					 seeking it's knowledge. When it refused to yield it, he slew it, preserving it
					 as it now was.
				-"What knowledge did they seek? To travel beyond this crystal sphere?"
					-"A weapon."
					-"Ah, I think I know of what you speak. . ."
				-Sszythrach confessed he came in search of knowledge as well, the escape from this
				 sphere he'd mentioned.
					-"Grant me my freedom and I will aid you in attaining what you seek."
					-He did not smell of lies (though seemed a bit crazy, as one would be after a
					 millenia or so), so Sszythrach assented.
					-Lacking Use Psionic Device, I needed to open my mind to the creature, but was
					 rewarded with a rush of knowledge, allowing me to use the machinery that would release this sorry creature.
					-At the pull of a final lever, the pillar retracted and the device containing
					 the brain was lowered to the floor, allowing it to move on a mechanism
					 unfamiliar to Sszythrach (treads).
			-I followed that by Plane Shifting us back to the Material, though I ended up quite a
			 distance away, brain-bot in hand, flying above the ocean.
	-It was quite a journey back to the fortress, fatigued as Sszythrach was, but he finally reached
	 the floating fortress's dock.
	-Sszythrach performed introductions, and told the rest that the creature had agreed to aid us.
		-Upon reaching the chamber in which we'd installed the helms, it asked us how we'd come by
		 helms of illithid manufacture, and we relayed the story of the illithid that traded the
		 spelljammer drive for it's solitude.
		-It then moved over to the central tank, and began to smash at it's glass container with
		 it's claw, eventually shattering it and throwing its brain into the pool.
		-It then asked us where to?
			-We confessed we were actually unsure, and merely wished at the moment to leave this
			 place far behind.
			-It then suggested Crucible, a place of commerce.
				-Sszythrach said that would likely suit Dokinanth and Cal just fine, and seemed a
				 good place to get our bearings.
				-With that, we were off at speed, soon leaving behind this sphere and travelling
				 through the misty green phlogiston.


TODO:
	-Loot bookkeeping:

				-Spent it maxing Knowledge(Religion), Spellcraft, Listen, Spot, and Sense Motive, and
				 boosting Search.
					-11+12+3+3+3+9
		-Apply the rest of the items.
			-Done.
		-Now, do money math resulting from that.

			-The "Triple Standard" for your adult CR of 13, 3*13,000=39,000, seems way low.
				-You have many times that.
			-Ah, it's equivalent to the XP required for a normal PC to reach that HD.
				-So, it was 171,000 to get to your current age, and then 231,000 for Adult.
				-We don't actually go up in age until it narratively happens, though: https://discord.com/channels/759886843801239603/759886844258943039/883053665638809660

		-Stuff to raise in session:
			-Do we keep magic items, for 1/4 hoard value, or sell them (presumably at 1/2)?
				-Mostly a Lesley question, as that seems to mostly moot the 1/4 hoard value thing,
				 though I guess it _incentivizes_ sale, rather than banking them?
	-Ask after the original form of that helpful brain.
		-Did so here: https://discord.com/channels/759886843801239603/759886844258943039/883464224569966642
		-It being an illithid would explain much, and raise many new concerns. . .


10/10/21:
	-The Crucible, or The Rock of Brawl (sp?), is the nearest place in "free space" that accepts a
	 variety of people, and is our destination.
	-With the time we spent traveling there, we were able to question this brain further about it's
	 nature.
		-It claimed it was once a titan, a massive humanoid from the far distant past, creators of
		 all that is.
		-He claims that the gods themselves were the work of the titans, but that, even before they
		 had begun creating worlds, they were visited by those that came before, the Illithids.
		-Predating even creation, the gods and Illithids were eventually at war, and the titans sided
		 with the Illithids.
		-The Illithids betrayed the titans, though, and this one was taken by an elder brain as a
		 trophy, reduced to this form.
		-It declined my offer to attempt to restore it's form, though, saying that it had been like
		 this so long it had nearly forgotten any other existance, and wished to remain thusly.
	-The journey took some time, and we got familiar with the basics of Spelljamming.
		-The titan-brain is able to power the castle's Pool Helm providing our ship with a base speed
		 of 5 Ship Rating, and we also have 12 Series Helms that can be powered by creatures with
		 spell-like abilities (and perhaps by normal spell casters too, as normal helms all use?),
		 each adding 1 to the Ship Rating if manned.
			-Conveniently, we have a bunch of dragons following us, many of whom can manage various
			 spell-likes.
		-Most of the phlogiston was a formless gray fog, but we traveled along a great river of
		 of flowing energy, a pathway of a kind in this strange desolation.
		-Eventually, we came to a great rock wall, bordering an area the titan-brain called The
		 Broken Vast, and passed through it by a route the brain knew.
		-At the center of this region lay Crucible.
	-Arriving finally at Crucible, which took the form of a great asteroid, covered in both buildings
	 and great fins and sails recalling a ship.
		-We joined a number of strange and fantastic ships at Crucible's docks, from which we could
		 observe many species, most unfamiliar to us, walking about he city.
		-The docks were largely manned by hippo-people and apes with gliding flaps linking their arms.
		-Illithids too coursed through the city, to the evident alarm of no one.
		-Perhaps most interesting, a "Southern" neighborhood featured dragons soaring above it, of
		 all kinds and ages.
	-The titan-brain reminded us that we were here for a map, and suggested that, in The Grand Market,
	 we seek out Illithids there.
		-Their maps, it says, are best, for they have sailed the phlogiston the longest.
	-I suggested we present ourselves to the city's rulers, those wyrms we saw circling, and then,
	 having announced our presence, venture into the market.
		-The titan-brain corrected me, though, saying that we'd have to go to the city's palace to
		 speak to it's rulers.
		 "What wyrm makes it's lair there?"
		 "No wyrm rules this city."
		 *Shocked Pikachu* "Then who rules here? Or at least did, when last you were here?"
		 "I imagine the same ones who have always ruled here, the dwarves."
	-As we moored ourselves to the dock, Starfire released his agents into the city, to learn of this
	 place.
		-One was fairly immediately accosted by a hippo-man claiming to be the harbormaster, speaking
		 of docking fees. He directed the creature to the ship's masters.
		-Coming aboard, he explained that there was both a docking fee and a two percent tax on goods
		 brought into the city.
			-The docking fee could be paid in cash or in the labor of 2/3rds of the crew.
			-The latter was quite attractive to us, with our surfeit of labor, and we accepted it,
			 with dwarves and hippo-men coming aboard to collect gangs of our followers and have us
			 sign paperwork.
	-We also took a moment to test our divine powers.
		-Our storm-god-granted power indeed fealt. . . weaker, translating to a +4 to attempts to
		 save against them.
		-Those granted by Tiamat to Arvaec, though, felt undiminished. 
	-Starfire's agents eventually brought us back word of The Grand Market, a place where seemingly
	 everything was for sale, noteably including ships and Spelljammer drives.
		-They used a currency of "chits", roughly equivalent to a platinum piece, which can be broken
		 up into "bits", or the equivalent of gold pieces.
	-They also brought back word of "dragon town", the neighborhood we saw dragons soaring over.
		-No council, nor single great wyrm rules the area. Instead, each wyrm claims a building as
		 it's territory here, and usually a larger territory somewhere out in the phlogiston.
		-It _does_ feature a "Drakkon Enclave", a meeting place.
		-They also seem to shamefully acknowledge the authority of the humanoid police throughout
		 the city ("Red Cloaks", to the upper class, but most of the rest of the city name them
		 "Black Helms").
		-Dragons are also shamefully considered largely equal, regardless of their age, to any other
		 inhabitant of the city.
	-Unlikely to offend our kin here, if they claim such small territories on the rock, we went to
	 the market.
		-On the way, vast differences in the technologies in use by various peoples were readily
		 apparent. From medieval things we're well familiar with, to black powder fire arms and
		 clockwork, to full on Sci-Fi space opera stuff.
		-Many homeless also abounded, featuring prominently among them rat-people and two kinds of
		 insect-person, one of them featuring four arms.
		-The market itself was dark and crowded, but featured seemingly every sort of good.
			-Cloth canopies, looming ships, and walkways formed a near complete roof over the area.
		-As we entered the market, in a caravan of our followers, we received many questions, about
		 what goods we bring, what good we want, and what crystalline sphere we came from.
			-Dokinanth announced us as coming from "Draconia", to which we heard things like, "Ah,
			 The Radiant Triangle. Good, good. . ."
			-A brisk trade in some of the smaller goods Dokinanth's gnomes had on hand quickly
			 ensued, teas and spices of our homeland given in exchange for exotic foods and
			 commodities available here.
		-We were soon approached by an Illithid, though, one bearing a strange medallion on his chest.
			-The medallion was made of reddish bronze, carved with a spiral pattern.
				-None of us recognized it.
			-It soon "spoke" to us, asking us if we were the owners of the docked castle.
				-Dokinanth first asked who it was  "The Hunger", a servant of Thrasadune.
				-It claimed it's elder brain had told it that a being, one not seen in a very long
				 time, had arrived aboard our castle. Not hard to guess who it "spoke" of.
				-After some hemming and hawing on Dokinanth's part, Sszythrach broke in, announcing
				 that we were indeed the ship's master.
				-It then explained that it sought us because it's elder brain had made agreements
				 with others. Others of it's kind were active in our homeland, interested in
				 preserving unique draconic lineages found there, having foreseen a cataclysm coming
				 to that land.
				-It asked us for a drop of blood from one of us, from which to make clones, an idea
				 we were less than enthused about. . .
					-The clones, it said, would live in Crucible, safe from whatever calamity had
					 been foretold.
				-In exchange, it offerred us an atlas, detailing all of the crystal spheres known to
				 it's kind.
				-Dokinanth asked it who or what Thrasadune was.
					-Thrasadune, it said, was a god of mystery, one who once visited here and was then
					 gone quickly.
					-Nonetheless, he had made quite an impression on the elder brain, who now
					 maintained a cleric of Thrasadune on his council always.
				-Asked for details of this cataclysm, it's eyes glazed over for a moment, and then it
				 responded, "The cataclysm has not yet occurred."
				-It also volunteered that the clones would be "severed" from us, such that they would
				 no longer serve as an arcane link to us.
					-That was indeed among my concerns, so I asked it if it could provide some surity
					 of that? It referred us (lol) to previous. . . customers, around the city, for
					 the elder brain had opperated here for some time.
				-Dokinanth also inquired about a town crier or the like, some means of finding
				 information in this strange city.
					-It said most bars and inns of the city should have an "echobox" for use, and that
					 they could also be purchased in the market.
						-Essentially, they're radios.
						-Dokinanth also asked then about the range of such things, and it responded
						 that they varied, from those limited to a short, local distance to
						 transmitters that could reach between the crystalline spheres.
				-We said we'd thinkg about the deal, speak with his references and talk it over.
	-From there, we went to Dragon Town, to speak with the dragons the Illithid had referred us to.
		-We even met a few of their clones.
		-The general opinion was that, though this whole thing was weird, it did seem to be on the
		 up and up. No great customer regrets or the like.
		-The only slight complaint came from the clones, who were banned from leaving Crucible, but
		 provided for in exchange.
	-We were convinced, and went off to convince one of our kindred aboard the ship to provide the
	 blood.
		-Perfidious actually volunteered, _to stay_, sending the clone with us.
		-Sszythrach was a bit astounded, and then scornful after Perfidious explained that the
		 concept of territory he need not fight for appealed to him. With his disability robbing
		 him of speech and more, though, I suppose it's the best he could hope for. . .
			-He'd at least managed to pick up sign language over the years.
		-We brought him to the market, and made the deal. The Illithids were amenable to Perfidious's
		 modified terms, and turned over to us the atlas.
	-The Hunger also offerred us another deal, mentioning something it desired in The Radiant Traingle.
		-A dish, actually. Made by a chef in a town called Solace, spiced potatos said to be the best
		 in all The Radiant Triangle.
		-In exchange, it offered weapons, of the sort it learned form Profidious we desired, with
		 which to defend our ship.
			-Pressed for specifics, it was vague still, but staked it's reputation on it: "It would
			 not be good business, to cheat your partners. . ."
		-Dokinanth also asked if it had coordinates or the like, at which it produced a strange
		 device, comprised of crystalline spheres.
			-23 phlogiston units each way.
		-Dokinanth also attempted a transparent ploy, mentioning the potatos would surely not keep.
		 Perhaps it could provide us with a faster drive?
			-Instead, it responded that surely we could obtain a Chrysalis of Preservation. . .
		-We agreed to the deal.
	-From there, Sszythrach suggested we do some shopping. We have many things to unload, and also a
	 few thing to purchase.
		-Caltor went off in search of a suitable merchant.
		-10 minutes after he left, though, an angel floated down the street, passerby giving it a wide
		 berth.
			-It bore a holy symbol in the shape of an open book.
			-It floated up to us, standing before Shiv and Arvaec and said, "All gods must register
			 in crucible. Come with me."
			-Sszythrach asked who it spoke of, but it yelled back, "Dragon! Know your place. The
			 divine stands before you!".
			-Arvaec, one of the two getting special attention, then tried, "Where I go, Sszythrach
			 can too." He too was shut down, though, as the angel said, "You failed to register! You
			 cannot make requests here!"
			-The angel then waved, summoning disks of light, that took Shiv and Arvaec, through the air
			 and across the city.
			-It took them across the city, to a clear space amongst the palace grounds across the lake.
			-There, it unceremoniously dumped them, saying, "The gods will not suffer further
			 competition. You must die." Then, it swung for us with it's sword.
			-In response, Shiv stepped into a shadow, and disappeared entirely (seemingly more so
			 than otherwise, Arvaec normally being able to track his hidden movements via _some_
			 senses).
			-Arvaec did not react in time to do anything at all, but nonetheless felt a wave of cold
			 come over him, and the angel's blade stopped dead the moment it came close to him.
			-Seizing his advantage, Arvaec reached forward, grasping the angel's wrist with his hand,
			 employing his energy drain ability to devestating effect.
			-The angel collapsed to it's knees, shouting, "It couldn't have happened already! You
			 weren't powerful enough!"
			-Shiv then reached towards the the stricken angel, and it disappeared as he had done.
			-More of the creatures swarmed out of the nearby buildings but, as they neared us, Arvaec
			 was suddenly elsewhere.
				-He found himself on a desolate moonscape, stars and asteroids overhead.
				-His form, too, was not his own, but rather that of a withered, desicated corpse
				 (though admittedly what he'll soon look like anyways).
				-As he walked around, he witnessed an asteroid hurtling towards the planet. It struck
				 and, in a flash of blinding light, he could feel his flesh blasted away.
				-Only to awake, garbed in a new corpse, that of an elf woman. Enclosed in a glass
				 box, I was surrounded by mourners, who reacted with great alarm as he/she sat up.
				 Soon, a cleric approached, yelling, and they thrust torches into the box.
				-And, once more, waking as a corpse, this one floating in water.
				-This repeated many times, until Arvaec again found himself in Crucible, though still
				 as a walking corpse.
				-He could see Shiv nearby, and Caltor soon popped into existence as well.
				-Arvaec, or the corpse he's garbed in, stood up from where it lay in an alley, and
				 approached them. As he focused, though, it was soon garbed in his gear, which faded
				 into being around him. It also seemed to possess noteably tough skin.
				-Caltor had just had a similarly surreal experience, also featuring an angry angel,
				 though he got a name of the god it served: Ashnos The Keeper, who keeps the history
				 of everything.
				-Caltor then did something to a nearby ad. It took on a new form, proclaiming the
				 merits of good from The Dragon Isles.
					-Actually, looking further, not just this ad, but all we could see had taken on
					 this new form.
				-Looking to the sky, we could see that more angels poured from the palace grounds
				 into the air, including twelve larger beings who grew and soon towered over the
				 city, flickering like insubstantial, ethereal beings.
					-The twelve great ones had various forms, with us recognizing Tiamat and Bahamut
					 among them, as well as a giant brain, a giant beholder, a skeleton, and, weirdest
					 a giant spiral, covered in eyes.
				-We also saw the dragons circling in the sky, from where they'd been trying to keep
				 watch over Shiv and Arvaec.
				-As we debated how to contact them, a robed figure materialized next to us, and spoke:
				 "They will continue looking for you. You are not gods, but they will continue
				 pursuing you nonetheless. The dragons are in danger too. They say they are the
				 breakers of names that made all this possible. Come with me, back to your ship. I
				 can take you to a place of learning, a safe place."
				-We agreed and, collecting those from the market, we headed back to the ship.
					-Keen-eyed Sszythrach spotted the rest of the party in the market, and sooned
					 joined them.
				-On the way out, Caltor again affected the ads throughout the market, which now read,
				 "Freedom of religion! Gods should be free!"
					-"That'll certainly piss them off," the robed figure said, chuckling.
					-He was highly intrigued by the powers over illusions that Caltor showed, asking
					 him to create the illusion of a knife.
					-The man then tested the illusion, feeling it's heft, and then even testing it's
					 point, which surprisingly drew blood.
						-He then asked for a series of further tests, in which Caltor demonstrated
						 some capacity for making his illusions _real_, albeit only so long as he
						 concentrated on it.
				-In fact, all three of the cohorts seemed to demonstrate strange new powers.
					-Arvaec demonstrated an extreme new resilience, and ability over the mindless
					 undead (also in Roll20):
						your body hardens and calloses becoming extreamly durable. You become immune to all damage except for that caused by a dragon's bane weapon. Dragon's bane weapons deal an extra 2d6 damage to you, and the total damage id doubled after it is rolled (quadrupled if it is a critical!)
						you can jump crystalinne spheres by possessing the bodies of mindless undead.
				-The robed man aided in our exploration of our new powers, a thing we were all
				 preoccupied by, but eventually also introduced himself as Urza.
					-He offered us his aid, as a master artificer, and the aforementioned place of
					 safety, if we would help him against a foe in a great battle.
					-His battle, he said, was stuck in a time loop, resolved in some time streams,
					 but not in others. He warned us that we would be drawn into this fractured time,
					 if we were to join him.
					-He came from Dominaria, in Mage Space, a long distance away. To get there, he
					 offered to upgrade our Spelljammer drive, rendering it much faster.
						-Magical materials will be required, though,  collected from Toril Space,
						 The City of Ravnica, Athas Space, Grey Space, and Siberys Space
					-He had originally come here seeking a great warrior, Elsbeth, from a land plagued
					 by gods as capricious as those of Crucible.
						-She is said to reside on the plane of Thedas.
					-He indicated that the three cohorts may be able to step between crystal spheres
					 in another way.
						-"No dragons allowed, huh?" Caltor chimed in.
						 "They too possess the spark, but it has not yet occurred," Urza said.
						 "They mistook this spark for godhood, but it is something else, which allows
						 walking between the crystal spheres."
						-He said, though, that it is possible to get lost when doing this, and that
						 we should travel thusly with him, lest that occur.
							-He also recommended avoiding "The Weird".
	-To pursue the magical ingredients we required, and given that a subset of us can travel much
	 faster, we opted to split up.
		-The cohorts would head to the city of Ravnica, a place that sounds suited more to discretion
		 than raining destruction form the sky.
		-The castle and it's contents, then, was to travel, far slower, to Grey Space, our reasoning
		 being that, as part of The Radiant Triangle, it is perhaps not unlike our home, a place we
		 rightly ruled.
	-In the blink of an eye, Urza and the cohorts were in Ravnica.
		-With Urza's guidance we all found ourselves in more or less the same area of the city.
		-Arvaec emerged in the body of a dead man, laying in the street. He stood, as his armor and
		 the rest materialized around him.
		-From this place, we need a special power core, obtained from an "Izzet" technician, for our
		 drive modifications.
		-With in a few minutes, we could see armed and armored figures, hassling people on the street
		 nearby, asking them for identification.
			-"This area is under control of the military. All not allowed here will be ejected."
		-Caltor quickly employed an illusion, duplicating around us the seeming of some blue-skinned,
		 four-armed humanoids passing on the street nearby. We then hustled out of the area.
	-Asking around, we learned the Izzet were a kind of guild, and were directed to a guild
	 house of their order.
		-Heading there, we found it a place bedecked in strange machinery, spewing lightening.
		-Most in the area were goblins, along with a smattering of humans, the blue-skinned people,
		 elves, centaurs, and even, rarely, wooly mammoth people.
			-Skulking in the shadows of dark alleys, we could also see stranger creatures, hybrid-
			 seeming things, combining the shapes of many animals.
		-We decided that Shiv, sneaking in, could watch the place a bit, get some sense of how they
		 do business and such.
			-Soon he was running back out, amongst the sound of alarms, after the electricity flowing
			 from the structure was disrupted.
			-We hid together inside an illusory structure created by Caltor.
			-"What did you do?!?" Caltor asked.
			 "I stole a power core."
			 "Do you know it was the right one?"
			 "It was the biggest. . ."
			-We observed the action for a bit, as several goblins examined the structure, eventually
			 replacing the device Shiv stole, resuming the flow of electricity.
			-Examining the device he stole, Caltor said it radiated magical energy, drawn from the
			 air and flowing out as electricity. Strangely, it seemed to do so without being magical
			 itself.
			-Arvaec also took a moment to test his powers.
				-He felt no connection to Isriboss, and only a faint connection to Tiamat.
			-Unsure if this is what we want, we asked around further, and what we stole is not, in
			 fact, a power core.
				-A power core, instead, is something that would exist beneath the guildhouse,
				 powering the whole of it.
				-Only one creature, it was said, could help us obtain such a thing: Niv Mizzet, the
				 guildmaster.
				-We also asked more about what the guilds were to this place.
					-There are 10 of them.
					-Each oversees a different type of magic in the city, and the conveniences
					 provided by that type of magic.
						-The Izzet oversee electricity.
						-The Orzov are bankers.
						-The Azorius provide a system of laws to the city.
					-They often war on one another.


11/6/21:
	-Caltor and Shiv did more asking around about Niv Mizzet, and how one would obtain an audience
	 with a guildmaster.
		-Apparently it would involve a permit from the Azorius Senate. Seemingly lawmakers, they
		 could enable one to petition a guildmaster for an audience.
		-Shiv investigated that end, and came back from one of the Azorius guildhouse/watchpost
		 buildings with a permit of some kind, after paying only a modest bribe, and which he'd
		 signed with Caltor's name.
	-All of us were somewhat agrieved by the loss of our Isriboss-granted powers on this plane, so
	 Caltor proposed some evangelizing.
		-He went about setting up an illusory pavilion, in some disused, rubble-strewn square, and
		 creating an also illusory, mostly-from-his-imagination altar to Isriboss.
		-Arvaec wanted no part of this, viewing Isriboss's powers as a service rendered to dragons,
		 rather than a function of god-worship, a distinction that has. . . theological implications
		 for him. Caltor mollified him by setting up a grand, if again illusory, statue of Tiamat
		 and a matching altar.
		-We went largely ignored for a day, but, by the next, folks had begun to stop by.
			-Probably in no small part due to Caltor offering free booze at the altar to Isriboss.
				-Another illusion, but few _wanted_ to disbelieve it.
		-Arvaec had only faintly felt the presence of Tiamat here and, in some of those who stopped
		 by, found that the _indirect_ worship of her _was_ rather widespread here, in the direct
		 worship of what sound like her children: chromatic-sounding dragons, mostly followed by the
		 barbarians among those passing through.
			-They spoke of someone who came to the city to spread the message of these great beasts,
			 coming from a plane called Tarkir, where the spirit of Tiamat is said to reside and her
			 children are exalted above all else.
		-That evening, we began to hear cacophonous "music" approaching.
			-As it did, people packed up belongings and fled in the opposite direction.
			-Eventually, . . . jesters with spiked collars, bearing torches stumbled spasmodically
			 down the street, coming with the music.
			-Simlilar revelers slowly stumbled, danced, or skipped into view. These, it would seem,
			 we're the Rakdos we'd heard so much about.
			-As more of the procession came into view, we saw it centered around a great demonic
			 figure in a rolling cart. Corpulent, it was constantly shoving various foods and. . .
			 offal into it's mouth.
				-Also among the procession were beautifully tortured harlequin-puppets, feeding the
				 demon on the cart, and grotesque flying demons, infants in shape and size.
			-As they neared our square, Caltor threw up the illusion of a portcullis across the
			 street they came down, and concentrated on it until it had held a few minutes against
			 the beating of the mob, and the force of some kind of fiery blast.
			-Eventually we could hear the sound of the mob giving up and turning back, the "music"
			 growing fainter again.
			-Caltor was not content to leave well enough alone, though, and, dismissing the
			 portcullis, he strode after them, disappearing from sight as he walked.
				-Soon, a (to Arvaec's willful eyes) illusory storm appeared above the carnival, no
				 doubt an illusion to our storm-given powers.
				-With Caltor's strange new powers over illusion, the rain still slowly put their
				 fires, one by one (a strange necessity of the semi-real illusion).
				-As the fires guttered out, the carnival went truely wild.
					-The flying infant-demons fell to the ground, twitching, and began to swell.
					-Revelers went about screaming and rending their skin, or were grabbed and
					 devoured by the fat demon in the cart, who was now eating _everything_ in sight.
			-Caltor then Dimension Doored back to us, as the previously flying demons had swollen
			 to the size of men, and were now ambling after him, towards us.
			-They were soon swallowed whole all together, though, by one of Shiv's new shadows.
			-We were then content to watch the cart-demon wreak havoc on his own followers, until,
			 standing amidst now-still devestation, it turned to us.
				-Arvaec then loosed a quick volley of arrows down the street at the demon, but it
				 merely pulled them from it's flesh and devoured them, as the wounds quickly closed.
				-As it strode down the street towards us, Shiv employed one of the thuribles,
				 blessing us all and throwing a Blade Barrier around Arvaec.
				-As it neared us, Arvaec switched to his Rod of the Viper, strode forward, and
				 taunted the beast.
				-It was as stupid as it was ugly, a fact Arvaec was quick to point out as it charged
				 straight through the whirling blades, heavily shredding it, with it's only rewarded
				 being a blow with the rod from Arvaec as it missed him with it's snapping maw.
				-Caltor had rendered his illusory depiction of Tiamat somewhat realer, and he had it
				 contribute with blasts from a multi-elemental breath weapon.
				-Arvaec lashed it with a now _live_ snake-headed rod, in between blasts of the
				 breath weapons, and Shiv stepped through a shadow into the inside of the barrier
				 to join in attacking it as well.
					-The snake's poison was not likely to harm the demon, but Arvaec was starting to
					 get into the spirit of things, now that he was scourging demons instead of
					 soliciting the general public, and liked the showmanship of it, and the
					 association with Tiamat's scaly aspect.
				-It, meanwhile, impotently gnawed at Arvaec's mailed and unbelievably tough arm,
				 until beneath many blows, it fell to the ground as stinking bloody rot.
			-None of the revelers seemed to be left, and we stood alone in the square.
		-As people slowly tickled back into the square, they reacted with shock to see us still
		 there.
			-Gradually, and especially once some of the first to arrive left, spreading word, people
			 began to return to the area.
			-They asked us what had happened, and Caltor was quick to tell the tale of us driving
			 off the Rakdos, and quick to add mention of Isriboss and Tiamat both, how this was
			 done in their name.
			-Cal began to supply music and illusion-booze both, as the square attracted a crowd and
			 began to take on the air of a festival.
			-Arvaec now really got into the preaching (making Diplomacy and Perform rolls), speaking
			 of how the Rakdos could not stand before the wrath of Tiamat.
				-He met with success, receiving donations of incense, coin, and even a sacrificed pig.
			-Clearly Caltor's efforts on behalf of Isriboss bore fruit too, as we could all feel
			 more and more of our connection to the storm, and soon felt we could access spells up
			 to level 3 here now, as Isriboss clerics.
			-The freewheeling festival then lasted until dawn.
				-Caltor did some gathering of information, during it.
					-There seems to be some tension between the apartment dwelling majority here
					 and the barbarian tribes that scorn living that way. The later take over
					 abandoned areas, establishing relatively savage, but free, homes.
					-There's general peace at the moment, but fear of future conflicts between the
					 guilds.
						-The last was Boros vs. Gruul, triggered by the Gruul destroying an entirely
						 neighborhood to return it to nature. There was no real winner, just
						 devestation.
		-We then rested for the evening, still in the square, sleepless Arvaec and Caltor lounging
		 while they watched over sleeping Shiv.
	-During the early morning, a great shape descended into the square, and we felt the
	 unmistakable presence of dragon-fear.
		-A colossal dragon had arrived, seemingly a mix of blue and red in form, but with
		 bronzed scales.
		-Arvaec greeted it, and introduced himself as "Ar vaec".
		-The dragon, though, ignored him, and instead pulled out a lens from a bag of holding around
		 his neck, and looking all around the square, particularly at it's illusions.
		-With his evident interest in illusions, _Caltor_ was able to get his attention, as he
		 stared intently at Caltor(with the lens-device rotating in different sets of lenses as he
		 did). Caltor had made several references to now _being_ an illusion himself, in some way,
		 and undoubtedly the dragon examined just that.
		-"So, you're the ones who broke into my guild hall," he said, speaking for the first time.
		 Caltor: "We wanted to get your attention. We succeeded, it seems."
		 Niv Mizzet: "You're not from here, are you?"
		 Caltor: "No, but we come with great need."
		 Niv Mizzet: "I feel it would be only right were you to help me first. I require a crystal
			          hive, from a place called Athas. Bring me this, and I will overlook your. . .
					  faux pas, stealing from me."
		 Caltor: "We need a small favor too, a power core."
		 Niv Mizzet: "Bring me the hive and we can speak of it."
		 Caltor: "Where is Athas?"
		 Niv Mizzet: "I do not know exactly. . . where, but I do not doubt you can reach it."
		 Caltor: "How will we return it to you?"
		 Niv Mizzet: "My agents will tell me when you've returned to the city."
		-And, with that, he flew off abruptly.
		-We were fairly sure we'd seen the name Athas on one of the maps of the crystal spheres
		 that we'd seen.
	-Well, with a potential deal in hand, we needed to consult those maps, then. As such, we shifted
	 back to our flying castle, The Sky Watch.
		-We'd been there before, and knew our new powers well enough to at least return somewhere
		 we'd been, even if it's position among the crystal spheres had changed.
		-The dragon's then got a summary of what had happened in Ravnica.
		-Sszythrach: "Hmph, we're being sent from one end of the multiverse to the other, chasing
					  wild geese. At least some end is in sight if we can unwind this piece. Do you
					  know anything more about this crystal hive?"
		-Urza then appeared, very conveniently, at that moment, seemingly from nowhere, asking,
		 "What is this crystal hive you speak of?"
		-And so, again, another summary.
		-Urza laughed, and said, "His spies are quick. He wants the same thing I need. The hive
		 possesses psychic properties."
		 Caltor: "Can we get one for each of you?"
		 Urza: "There are enough for us both. You'll need to retrieve them from the thing they grow
		        on, a thing that may or may not be alive.
		 Caltor: "Do you know the location?"
		 Urza: "Yes. The locals use it for their own savage purposes. Smaller clusters exist, and
		        one large one is known. If a cluster was brought to me, I have resources enough to
				feed it while it produces another hive. The large one may produce multiple hives, 
				if wounded.
				Athas is some distance from here, though, as the Spelljammers travel. There is
				something else, Nephelim glass, that is close at hand in Grey Space. It too is
				necessary for the Spelljammer drive enhancements. It will shield the drive while
				allowing us to examine it's workings, for maintenance.
	-Grey Space, then, seemed liked the place to go first. The cohorts would proceed the castle and
	 the rest by a few days and, once we had the glass, we'd head for Athas.
		-Urza would be guiding the cohorts to Grey Space, and also supplied us with several maps.
		-The depicted a fortress, and he said a vein of the glass was known to be found deep within
		 it's basement.
		-He told us a tribe of kobolds lived within the fortress, and that he'd dealt with them in
		 the past. They can mine it, but it's easier to gather it yourself.
			-He said that a Shatter spell was all he had needed to do so in the past.
		-Urza also knew the entrance and a spot in the basement well enough to help us visualize and
		 shift to the areas.
		-After some discussion, we opted to send the cohorts directly into the basement, relatively
		 close to where the ore vein was supposed to be.
		-We'd also disguise them, with Caltor's new illusion powers, as kobolds.
	-Shifting there, our first impression of the grove was a great carving, on the wall of this
	 underground grove.
		-It depicted a great red dragon with demonic features being stabbed in the chest by an elf
		 woman. The next scene showed it's guts spilling out, particular it's heart, while the next
		 showed it, unphased, ruling over a scene of humanoids.
		-We clearly recognized this depiction of Ashardalon, a being we're well familiar with from
		 our home, but there, he was not worshiped as a god. Not even the council had that temerity,
		 but here things are clearly otherwise.
		-A tree also grew over a broken altar there, half alive and half dead, each half bearing
		 apples. On one side, they looked lush, and the the other, white and withered.
		-That's all we could take in before being swarmed by stick people, some kind of animated
		 wooden creature, well under two feet tall.
		-Shiv swallowed most of them in shadow, and the three that remained scratched impotently
		 at our armor.
		-Arvaec pinned the one attacking him with his foot, and then asked the others, "So, which
		 way? That way looks to be the Northern passage from the map?"
		-More of the stick creatures seemed to be emerging from piles of brambles scattered about,
		 so we moved that direction.
			-Caltor summoned an illusory ring of fire which kept them back, and gave us a moment to
			 reach for our godly patrons.
			-Arvaec could feel a strong connection to Tiamat here, and a fainter one to Isriboss.
	-We walked past a series of minor horrors, giant rats, pits full of zombies, and a tunneling
	 elemental of some kind, but all ignored us or fled at the sight of Arvaec.
	-We found our goal, a cave whose walls were thoroughly encrusted with blue-ish glass, but also
	 with holes from the tunneling, worm-like earth elemental.
		-Anticipating trouble if we distrubed it's food source, Cal readied a suggestion spell as
		 Arvaec Shattered some of the glass.
		-Sure enough, the glass walls brightened with the red glow of the tunneling elemental, but
		 we saw no reason to stick around, and shifted back to Sky Watch with the glass.


TODO:
	-Shopping? https://discord.com/channels/759886843801239603/759886844258943039/906663422211534868
		-Yep, we're doing it between sessions.
		-You need to reserve 231,000 for going up to Adult, but should have plenty beyond that.
			-Confirmed with Lesley that "we manage to sell all of that at the usual half price, save
			 the Gray Gem, the glass, and anything someone wants to claim?"
			-That gives you 161283.75+370846.58=532130.33, or potentially 301130.33 to spend.
				-Oh, no, you have less, as you claimed many different items.
					Claimed: (32650+26650+10000+110000+85,000)/2=132,150
						-Last 85,000 is Dragon's Eye Amulet, only claimed if S gets his belt.
				-Sell Arvaec's Full Plate +2 for 5650/2 as well.
			-So, you actually have 301130.33-132150+5650/2 = 171805.33 available.
				-Still a lot, but basically will only get the belt, if that's available.
				-It's only available because a quarter of it's value will count towards the hoard.
			-Maybe sell Arvaec's expensive-but-not-amazing ioun stone too?
		-Stuff to consider:
			200,000	Belt of Magnificence
			 98,000	+7 (5 element) bow?
			 25,000	Cloak of Resistance +5
			 64,000	Bracers of Armor +8?
		-Belt is available, so I guess that's what you do!
			-Do the required updates.
				-Shit, was looking at the wrong dragon table during part of this, hence FIXED.
				-Gloves added to Arvaec.
					-Did attack macros.
				-Mitre added to Arvaec.
					-(DONE) Do it's impact on bonus spells, going from +2 item to +6.
				-Belt added.
					-FIXED Stats bumped.
					-FIXED Did DCs.
					-FIXED Did skills
						-2*21=42 more points
						-Are my current skills correct?
							-Spent: 5+22+22+22+5+22+19+22+22+22+5+19=207
							-Should have: 21*(6+7)=273
							-Looks like I never did skills for the sudden jump to YA
							-So, figure out 273+42=315 worth of skills.
								-Done!
						-Actual:
							-19*(6+7)=247
							-Diff 273-247=26
					-NO FIX Did turning attempts.
						-Do new persistent spell?
							-Righteous Might? https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Righteous_Might
								-Being bigger is awkward, but _is_ a stackable Con bonus.
					-NO FIX Did HP.
					-NO FIX Did attack macros.
				-Move int stone to Arvaec and do skills
					-Are his current skills wrong too?
					-Wait, is he even the right level? He should be 19 if Sszythrach is 21.
						-Yeah, his skills and spells both look like 17, not 19.
				-Did Gold.
				-Added amulet to Arvaec.


11/20/21:
	-We continued on our way to Athas, in our flying castle.
	-The journey was interrupted, though, as a vistor alighted on our castle, mid-flight.
		-The first Sszythrach heard was it's roar. Scrambling to basement balcony, he took wing,
		 flying out and up to the "ground" level of the castle.
		-There, I could see a huge dragon. It was (or, perhaps, _was_) a red, but it's chest cavity
		 gaped ragged and hollow, shining with a sickly green light, and from all of it dripped oily
		 black corruption.
			-Similar, but distinct from the corruption we'd seen on our home sphere's material plane.
				-The oiliness of it seemed new.
		-As Sszythrach and Dokinanth flew up to it, it turned towards us and lunged, breathing a
		 noxious breathweapon comprised of the same corruption.
			-Sszythrach legendary hardiness saw him through the attack, but Dokinanth was afflicted
			 by the foul stuff, and noxious looking boils grew around his ears and claws.
		-Arvaec, meanwhile, was hustling up the stairs from the basement in which he was abandoned
		 by Sszythrach, slamming through the doors of the "ground" floor just in time to witness
		 the corrupting attack.
		-Casting his head about, looking for more foes, Sszythrach saw none, and thus gave the thing
		 the full force of his breath weapon
			-Shockingly, it weathered it.
			-As such, Sszythrach then flew to the side of the rock on which the castle was mounted,
			 digging his claws into it andtaking some cover from the creature, as provided by the
			 angle.
		-Arvaec then felt some kind of change to the bubble in which the castle traveled.
			-Conferring later with the others, it seemed some kind of abjuration affect, maybe a
			 ward, had been applied, as it interfered with magical travel Caltor attempted during
			 the fight.
		-Arvaec blasted the thing with unholy flames and, though the flames seem ineffective, divine
		 energies still did some damage.
		-As the others activated various spells, it skittered over to Sszythrach, in a motion more
		 insect than dragon.
			-As it's head peeked over the ledge that Sszythrach lurked below, he managed to lunge
			 up and bite it. His reward was a mouthful of sickening oil, which thankfully did phase
			 him, and some damage to the creature's neck, which certainly gladdened him.
			-It followed that with it's own attack, some kind of necromantic effect channeling
			 negative energy into force damage.
		-The others attempted various spells, with mixed and minor effects, followed by a flurry of
		 attacks from enraged Sszythrach.
			-He landed a few decent blows, but this time, bits of the corruption flung free from the
			 abomination _did_ cling to Sszythrach, sinking into his scales.
		-Arvaec, then, blasted it with another Flame Strike.
		-Caltor joined in that too, slamming an illusory-but-sort-of-real weight into the thing, to
		 substantial effect.
		-It was still intent on Sszythrach, and struck out with it's own flurry of blows, dealing
		 grevious, corrupted wounds to Sszythrach and seemingly tugging at his very soul.
		-Dokinanth then struck out at it, with spell-lengthened limbs, in an effort to avoid the
		 corruption. He dealt a few more wounds.
		-Sszythrach was forced, by his many wounds (particularly the negative levels) to retreat.
		-After that, the battle descended into a slog, as we tried spell after spell to pierce this
		 thing's many immunities.
		-After a short while of that, though, whatever was affecting the bubble around the castle
		 changed, hexagonal openings forming in it and. . . something pouring in, a shimmer of
		 glittery light.
		-Undeterred, we continued to pummel the thing with various spells.
		-Caltor also called out to Sszythrach, saying he had a ring that could perhaps help Sszythrach.
			-Sszythrach took him up on his offer, and scurried up to the side of the tower Cal was
			 hiding within, thrusting one clawed hand inside for the ring.
			-Caltor placed it on one of his fingers, and the negative levels were immediately banished.
			-Sszythrach then rushed forward towards the shimmers, halting 15 ft. short of them.
		-Arvaec, meanwhile, hit the thing with another Flame Stike, and the beast finally collapsed
		 under it's many wounds.
			-As it did so, though, it called out, saying, "This is but my first coming. I am endless."
			-Uh oh.
		-We then turned to face these new arrivals, as the shimmer slowly formed into (somewhat)
		 humanoid figures.
			-The formed on the clump of ground attached to castle, and also appeared to be more
			 horrifying combinations of necromanticly animated flesh and machinery, much like the
			 "dragon".
			-Shiv immediately greated them with a storm-god-powered Firestorm, leaving all of them
			 greviously burned.
		-They then ran towards Sszythrach, the closest of us to it.
			-He got a good bite in as one of them closed within his reach, the rest of the large
			 creatures closing in behind it.
		-Before Sszythrach could strike at more of them, Shiv struck them with another spell, an
		 Ice Storm this time, and Dokinanth finished them of with his screeching breath weapon.
		-We cast our eyes about, looking for more attackers, but saw none.
		-As such, Sszythrach and Dokinanth fell to discussing the corruption these things had
		 sprayed, and how to cleanse it.
		-A round into that, though, the corpses of the more humanoid things exploded, spraying all
		 of us around them with more corrupting oil.
	-We then set about seeing what we could do about the phyresis corruption.
		-Greater Restoration seemed to remove some portion, and other Restoration spells had similar
		 effects. Miracle proved able to set you back to the previous taint category too (the minimum
		 phyresis score to go down a level).
	-The ward affecting our ability to reach outside our bubble of subspace also eventually seemed
	 to fade.


-TODO:
	-Adjust spells prepped?
		-Blood Wind is amazing for both characters. https://dndtools.net/spells/spell-compendium--86/blood-wind--3975/
		-Holy Star remains very tempting: https://dndtools.net/spells/spell-compendium--86/holy-star--4709/
		-Maybe ditch:
			-Divine Power, since you now already have the Str bonus.
			-The stat boost spells, including Arvaec's extended one at level 3, since they won't stack.
	-(DONE) Level Arvaec to 19 and move int ioun stone to him.
		-SHIT, wong dragon table. He's still 17.
		-STILL Do Skills
			-Ioun stone adds 1*17
		-unDid HP
	-(DONE) Undo Sszythrach impacts of table fuck up.
	-Do new persistent spell, due to belt?
		-Righteous Might? https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Righteous_Might
			-Being bigger is awkward, but _is_ a stackable Con bonus.
			-Can always polymorph, though, somewhat obviating this.
			-Ah, far outclassed by non-Core cheese.
		-Miracle allows Bite of the Werebear: https://dndtools.net/spells/spell-compendium--86/bite-werebear--3950/
			-Crazy physical stat bonuses and natural armor.
			-Probably the way to go.
		-Visage of the Deity, Greater: http://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/complete-divine--56/visage-deity-greater--757/index.html
			-Stackable template bonuses to all stats, but sadly only +2 to Con, and the rest of the
			 abilities are wasted on a dragon.
			-Eh, I think this may be too weak for dragons. Maybe just prep, but even that is iffy.
			-Ah, but on Arvaec! TODO


-TODO:
	-Get Arvaec a bow that deals all of Tiamat's five elements.
		-He's got a great attack bonus while buffed anyways, so this would be a good tactical fit,
		 as well as thematic.
	-Spreadsheet-ify followers.
		-Search "Eventually sort your followers out", above.
		-You probably have more of them! You went up two age categories, and the last, unexpected
		 one, at least, could not have been factored in.
			-Yeah, this, your old count you actually fleshed out, looks like the one you had at
			 juvenile:
				1st	2nd	3rd	4th
				30	3	1	1
			-At young adult, you should have:
				1st	2nd	3rd	4th	5th	6th
				60	6	3	2	1	1
			-But, given the currently crowded flying fort, and trip to parts unknown, maybe recruit
			 those later, and better suited to your new life.
			-You could narrowly fit a White Wyrmling as a 5th level follower, but they're not yet
			 very useful, so probably no dragons unless Lesley waives the level adjustment or
			 something like that.
	-Clarify how that "year and a day" works.
		-You'd initially figured it started immediately, but that seems unlikely to be true with you
		 now sleeping many years past that.
	-Arm the flying fortress.
		-Posted about it here:
			https://discord.com/channels/759886843801239603/759886844258943039/877997542409904238
			In character as Sszythrach:
			Yessss. . . Weapons are important. Perhaps great siege engines. . . 
			Our enemies have conveniently gathered themselves in one place, and I long for the day we rain death upon them. Such tools can serve us well against the old fools of the council.
		-Cannons? Spelljammer shit?
			-Crucible may be a good place to find either.
	-What do we do about the dragons who followed us for vengeance upon the humans?
		-Reveal to them that they resided on the island all along, among The Painted Ones?
			-Mix in some insinuations?
				-"How could the council not know of this infestation, there for the long centuries since last humans attacked? We may know they're fools, but could they be _that_ blind? They let the humans slay so many, before they acted, and punished those who _did_ act. I wonder, was this what they _wanted_? Dragons dead by human hands, to secure their power over us?"
			-Proposed that here: https://discord.com/channels/759886843801239603/759886844258943039/878003104816193567
		-Can one of them be a mount for Arvaec? Plenty are big enough.


-TODONE:
	-Figure out that greater touchstone power.
		-Didn't get the details of it written down.
		-Lesley's links related to it:
