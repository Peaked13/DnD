20	Psy. War 1?		Would give bonus feat and weapon profs. Don't think it ever really gives you casting worth caring about, nor substantial PP.
21	Thrallherd 1?	Enabled by 20 bonus feat and respec of II (Feat is Epic Spellcasting)
  or
20	Thrallherd 1?	Enabled by respec of last two feats. This seems like the way to go.
21	Thrallherd 2?	Still two Psion levels left that give PP. (Feat is Epic Spellcasting)
22	Thrallherd 3?
23	Psy. War. 1?	Gives you a bonus feat, weapon perfs., a weird power, and another manifesting class to advance.
  or same as above, but:
23	War Mind 1?		Has faster Psy. War. casting progression. Only costs another Knowledge(History) rank and the feats and profs. Psy War would have given you. Gets you +1 BAB and +2 Ref. (No! 'Cause epic. Probably enough to not do this.), though. I guess the casting _does_ cap out, and the 6th level Dispelling Buffer _would_ be nice, but that matters only if the game goes _well_ past 30. . .
  do I even want this?
??	Constructor 10	Oh, Epic Psionic Focus makes this worthwhile!	Same		0


Portfolios (Jake ruled we get 4):
	Abundance, Crystals, Engineering, Psionics
Divine Rank Planning:
Rank	Divine Saliant Abilities
	1	Divine Earth Mastery (if Earth domain), Increased Spell Resistance
	2	Divine Skill Focus (Psicraft)
Interesting ones:
	DR 5 and less:
		-Oh! Divine Skill Focus is an _amazing_ adjunct to Epic spell casting.
		-Alter Size then Alter Form, and even more after DR 6.
			-Fits being a creature in full conscious control of his physicality.
		-Automatic Metamagic: Amazing, but need to get a metamagic feat first.
			-Once you have Quicken Power, it's a must.
			-Twin Power would be cool too.
		-Call Creatures(Elans) would be interesting.
		-Gift of Life is OK.
		-Increased Spell Resistance is solid.
		-Know Secrets is OK-ish, but thematic.
		-Divine Recall is terrible, but thematic.
		-Somehow getting to 29 Cha would allow some amazing stuff, like:
			-Alter Reality: Free wishes!
			-Avatar: Be many places at once!
	DR 6-10:
		-Extra Domain is great.
			-Pick up Creation, at least.
		-Create Object is OK, fast True Creation without the XP cost, and combining it with Divine
		 Earth Mastery and/or Fabricate eases the material limits somewhat.
			-Shit, you can already True Create without cost, due to being able to use your domain
			 spell as spell-like abilities: 
			 "Spell-like abilities are magical and work just like spells (though they are not spells and so have no verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP components)."

Epic Spells Known:
	-"Edric's Insight"
		-+11 insight Int to all within 20 ft. burst with 300 ft. range. Duration is 40 hours.
		-11 min. casting time, and 42d6 backlash. Will negates (harmless).
			-Talked with Jake and the Elan Resilience can indeed be applied to backlash.


Psicrystal @ Lvl 21:
	Diminutive Construct
	Hit Dice: As master’s HD (hp 1/2 master’s)
	Initiative: +3*
	Speed: 30 ft.*, climb 20 ft.*, fly 50 feet (poor)
	Armor Class: 27 (+4 size, +3 Dex*, +10 Natural**), touch 17, flatfooted 24 (also probably shares your inertial armor)
		You can also assign a +1 Dodge bonus.
	Base Attack/Grapple: +0/–17
	Space/Reach: 1 ft./0 ft.
	Saves: Fort: +6, Ref: +13, Will: +14 (uses master's now-unchanging base saves and own bonuses)

		Str: 1*
		Dex: 16* (increased 1 for HD)
		Con: —
		Int: 28** (increased 1 for HD, and 11 for Edric's Insight)
		Wis: 10
		Cha: 13 (increased 3 for HD)
	Skills**:
		Same ranks as owner, plus a minimum of 4 ranks each in Spot, Listen, Move Silently, and Search. 
			A psicrystal uses its own ability modifiers on the skill checks.
			Use it to aid you on craft checks!
				On Minor Creation and Fabricate? Yep, Jake confirmed it!
		Listen: 6
		Move Silently: 7*
		Search: 13**
		Spot: 6
	Feats** (Jake confirmed it gets them):
		Alertness
		Mindsight
			http://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/lords-of-madness--72/mindsight--1960/
			See subjects with minds out to telepathy range of 30 ft.
		Draconic Aura (Senses)

			+1 to Listen, Spot, and initiative checks for self and allies within 30 ft.
		Wild Talent
			2 power point and now psionic
		Lifesense
			https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/libris-mortis-the-book-of-undead--71/lifesense--1764/
			Small or medium creatures shed 60' of light only you can see. Each size above medium doubles the radius.
		Dodge
		Hover
			http://marksworld.zeemer.com/files/feats/featlibrary/hover.html
			It can hover despite it's fly speed's Poor maneuverability.
		Epic Reflexes
		Take these later:
			Epic feats, now that it's got >20 HD?
				Great Intelligence for +1 Int?
				Looks like that and the save feats are the only ones remotely worth it.
			Psionic Dodge?
			Save bonus feats?
				Get the Epic versions now, instead.
			Feat giving skill bonus for Hide and Move Silently?
				Stealthy
			Another Draconic Aura?
				http://therafim.wikidot.com/draconic-aura
				Only one can be in use at a time
				Another aura, Vigor, seems possible (PHB II, pg. 13), granting fast healing 1 to anyone below half
					Decent
					Seems to still work on constructs: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Construct_Type
				Resolve is a decent option: "a bonus on Concentration checks and on saves against fear, paralysis, and sleep effects."
				Swiftness is almost OK
					"Swiftness: This aura grants you a bonus on Climb, Jump, and Swim checks. It also increases your climb, fly, and swim speeds by 5 × your bonus. (The aura doesn’t grant you a fly or swim speed if you don’t already have one.)"!
				Eh, over all, not great options
			Dragontouched would enhance the auras, but you need one more charisma
				http://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/dragon-magic--62/dragontouched--747/index.html
				NOPE! The increased bonus is pegged to *class* level in Draconic Aura's description
			More flight feats?
				Good list: http://marksworld.zeemer.com/files/feats/flight.html
				After Hover, Improved Flight might be the only other useful one (that you qualify for).
					The Complete Adventurerer doesn't require "Natural" fly speed, and explicitly allows it for magic or shapechanging.
	Special Qualities**:
		Construct traits:
			A psicrystal has immunity to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects,
			mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that
			requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits,
			nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage,
			but it can be repaired. Psicrystals do not have the usual construct traits of darkvision and low-light vision.
		Hardness 8
			-Hardness applies to energy damage and the like.
			-As an object with hardness, it may also take less damage from some energy types: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Breaking_and_Entering#Energy_Attacks
				-Jake has not yet confirmed this.
		Alertness (Ex): Psicrystal in arms reach gives owner +2 Listen & Spot
		Improved Evasion (Ex)
		Personality (Artiste) (Ex): +3 to owner's Craft skills
		Self-Propulsion (Su):
			-Standard action by owner to grow legs for 24 hours. 30 ft. land, 20 ft. climb
			-This is part of Edric's morning routine, along with Flight and gaining psionic focus (for you both!).
			-Monster Manual entry also mentions "a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10,
			 even if rushed or threatened." I think this is a property of having a climb speed.
		Share Powers (Su):
			-Any power owner casts on self can be shared with psicrystal, though duration stops if it moves > 5 ft. away.
			-Additionally, owner can cast powers with target of self on psicrystal as touch.
		Sighted (Ex): Telepathic sight and hearing to 40 ft. Ignores darkness and silence, though can't see invisible/ethereal.
		Telepathic Link (Su): As Mindlink with owner, out to 1 mile. Allows owner to teleport to it as if he'd seen location.
		Deliver Touch Powers (Su):
			-Owner, in contact with crystal, may designate it the "toucher" for touch range power, though it's lost if the
			 owner manifests another power before it's delivered.
		Telepathic Speech (Ex):
			-Can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 ft. that has a language, if within 1 mile of owner.
		Flight (Su):
			-Standard action by owner to grant flight speed of 50 feet (poor) for 24 hours.
			-This is part of Edric's morning routine, along with Self-Propulsion and gaining psionic focus.
		Power Resistance 25** (Ex):
			-Equal to the owner's level + 5.
		Sight Link (Sp):
			-If the owner is 13th level or higher, the character can remote view the psicrystal(as
			 if manifesting the remote view power) once per day.
				https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/remoteViewing.htm
		Channel Power (Sp):
			-Manifest powers through the psicrystal to a distance of up to 1 mile.
			-The psicrystal is treated as the power's originator, and all ranges are calculated from
			 its location.
			-When channeling a power through his psicrystal, the owner manifests the power by paying
			 its power point cost. He is still subject to attacks of opportunity and other hazards of
			 manifesting a power, if applicable
	* with self-propulsion activated
	** changes with owner's levels (usually just psionic ones, but that doesn't matter for Edric)
	This gets ability increases
		"..... I read the listing over again. The Psicrystal needs a Cha of 11+ to manifest a power. Meh, I can wait 2 levels to put a point into that stat. I'll be putting points into that specific stat anyway, I want the Psicrystal to have Lifesense."
			From: http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?366175-What-are-the-best-feats-to-give-a-3-5-Psicrystal/page2
		Asked about it, with Monster Manual page reference: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/597112043107123200
			Yep, Jake confirmed it
		Charisma to 13 for life sense seems to be the way to go
		Then maybe dex or int
	Holy crap! Do psicrystals get _item slots_?
		Listing his inventory under yours, tagged with "(Worn by psicrystal)"
		Sure seems like they've got most of them, according to the Magic Item Compendium.
			Where I found that: http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?585673-3-5-Magic-Item-Slots-For-Various-Creatures
		I talked about that page and more here: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/665035124366245939
		Healing belt will be an early priority, but the possibilities are endless and endlessly weird.
		Things that it can use it's actions to activate are good for it, though soon many of those actions will go to restoring focus
		Concentration boosting items become useful at 12, and remain so until 16, when your bonus for the skill hits 19
			To restore focus
			At 12, your skill will be 15
			Creating a brand new one (Renar!):
			Skill bonus (competence)	Bonus squared × 100 gp
			Slotless doubles the cost
				Maybe make it an ioun stone?
				Better yet, stick on crystal! Bedazzle that psicrystal!
				+4 would cost 3200 gp., or 1600 and 128 XP!
					-1.6 days to craft
						-Hmm. . . at that price, more of these are interesting, but you might need to respec
						 Renar in and out of skills, which would substantially increase XP costs
				Then, when the crystal is done with it, stick it on you!
			Got it.

Power Stone Bandolier:
	-A plain leather band, worn as a bandolier against my bare chest, with my many power stones
	 tightly embedded within it, such that only a little bit of the stone is exposed, on the inward
	 side of the band andtouching my skin. It was carefully sized to also fit around the waist of
	 the tentacle monster Renar often helps me transform into.
		-Worth about 6 gp.
	-I personally fabricated it here: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/674826657948893199
	-The stones embedded in it are tracked on both your powers.html and your gear spreadsheet
	 (the latter mostly to amuse yourself by tracking their value).

Stuff Edric always does:
	-Every morning:
		-Psionically focus himself and his psicrystal.
		-Refresh his psicrystal's 24 hour Self-Propulsion and Flight abilities.
		-Summon his floating disk (periodically resummoning it as needed).
	-Takes a round to restore focuses as needed, after combat is over.
	-Manifest powers without their display if it's automatic.
		-DC is 15 + power level
		-So, at level 12, that's 4th level and below.

Edric's Plane:
	-"The Nested Domains of the Enlightened Edric"?
	-The focus is an elaborately complicated forked rod made from crystalline adamantine, seemingly
	 grown into it's shape. A thing few other than Edric could make.
	-Size:
		-Created on the 1st day of the 4th month of year 301.
		-Recieved some number of expansion castings of Create Demiplane, Greater during 11/3/21
		 session.
	-It's weird gravity:
		-"Gravity points to the nearest of the spheres or connecting pillars making up the plane."
		-I even threw together plane_gravity_diagram.png, to demonstrate what I mean.
	-Other properties (from Create Demiplane, Greater):
		-Double the normal rate of time.
		-Enhanced Magic for Creation spells and powers.
	-Portals:
		-A portal links Dungeon Level 1 of Xûl-Jarak and it's twin on Outer Boundary.
	-The adamantine barriers between the spheres:
		-Inside each of his plane's stone spheres, Edric transmutes a portion of the stone into
		 a foot thick sphere of adamantine. He also needs to perform maintenance over time, both
		 creating more barriers in new sphere as they form and expanding the existing barriers
		 as their spheres grow. For the latter purpose, Edric builds carefully designed
		 expansion joints into each sphereical barrier, comprised of densely interlinked
		 chainmail-like adamantine rings, allowing the spheres to grow for a few years before
		 maintenance is required yet not permitting anything much larger than a fly to tunnel
		 through.
		-Further hardened by your now at will Hardening spell too.
			-Looks like that'll take several months, so I'll at least get it _started_, but it will
			 likely take a very long while.
	-The spheres:
		-Boundary:
			-The outermost sphere of The Domains, it serves as their interface with The Multiverse.
			-Outer Boundary is a crystal-studded but otherwise flat desert of hard-packed earth.
			 Roads crisscross it, but serve mostly as guidance between landmarks, as the hard
			 surface allows travel off them nearly as easily.
				-The clusters of crystals are sparse, and range from waist high to twice a man's
				 height. Though they appear random, they actually follow a complex pattern, and can
				 be read by those who know it, to identify their current location on the sphere and
				 nearby landmarks.
				-Edric's copy of Xûl-Jarak stands here, with it's portal to the original. It appears
				 to be a perfect duplicate of the whatever Edric has currently done to the original,
				 but actually possesses a variety of changes to optimize it for defense against
				 intruders coming _from_ the portal, rather than those attempting to get _to_ it on
				 The Material.
			-Inner boundary is TODO
				-City? Market?
		-The Sanctum:
			-Only about 20' across, the interior of the innermost sphere contains Edric's crystal-
			 pierced meditation chamber, from which he connects to the entirety of The Conflux.
				-He fits within only because he can freely move _through_ the crystals. No other
				 creature much larger than a cat would.
			-The outside of The Sanctum is covered in a frequently shifting crystalline structure.
			 Resembling abstract art, it is in fact elaborately encoded notes and diagrams concerning
			 whatever Edric is thinking through within.

Feats to look at:
	-Psionic Meditation
		-This makes the 10th level of Constructor, with free Quickened for Astral Constuct, very
		 worth it
		-Only question now is when you take this and the 10th level
			-This at 15 and then the level at 16 is possible
				-Would delay your 1st 8th level power by a level, which might not be worth it
					-Getting Greater Teleport might be a big deal for you, probably depending on
					 how much Adalia is around
			-Reforming into this is always an option too, allowing a temp feat in the meantime
			-Maybe get Expanded Knowledge(Teleport, Psionic) at 15, Constructor 10 at 16, and then
			 respec feat to Meditation at 17, when you get Greater?
				-Earlier teleport, Quicken as fast as possible (but with limits), then everything
				 great at 17, for a mere handful of XP
		-You have the Wisdom
	-Extend Power followed by Persistant Power?
		-Extend is semi-useful but not amazing. Making a psionic analogue of Persistant Spell,
		 though, could be good, especially with power stone sourced buff powers
	-Expanded Knowledge
		-Always interesting powers on other lists
	-Midnight Augmentation?
		-http://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/magic-of-incarnum--74/midnight-augmentation--1939/index.html
		-Weird incarnum stuff, but might be powerful
			-Eh, not astonishingly

Potential Powers:
	7th:
		Oak Body is decent
			Crucially, you're immune to _poison_, along with all sorts of other stuff
			Grants the same to your psicrystal, by virtue of that ability to share personal range spells
			Ah, Iron Body is this, but better, as an 8th level power
				Only get Oak temporarily (Refomation!) or if you really want 8th level slots for other stuff
		Mind Blank, Personal is almost as decent
			Duration of a day, and blocking mind control and scrying is starting to get important at so high of ability
			level
			Ooo, given it's duration, a power stone is a decent substitute for actually taking it
				Only costs 2,275 gp. for one
		Phase Door would also be a neat stone
		Divert Teleport is getting even more niche
		Same deal with Evade Burst
			Eh, maybe it's worth geting, especially for protecting your psicrystal
			Nah, because it prevents you from using your immediate save bonus too.
		Energy Wave is probably the best of the direct attacks
		Decerebrate is Fortitude or (sort of) die
			-The "sort of" is important, as a powerful cleric can restore them, making it sort of a
			 knockout power
		Moment of Prescience, Psionic is a _huge_ bonus
			-Depends on if Jake lets me use this with craft and knowledge checks, which is stretching the flavor
				-Ahhh, it explicitly can't, due to commas. It only applies to *opposed* ability or skill checks.
	For 11th (aside from the below):
		No, wait, it's totally Quintessence
			It plus items made with creation is amazing. Those poisons just got a lot more flexible.
			Eh, Jake ruled it out: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/664978640689299467
			That removes any reason to take this power.
				Well, not entirely. Turned out well as a power stone, dumping end-of-day points
				into it for later niche applications.
		Body Purification, solving the risk of poison somewhat?
		Correspond could be handy, though the telegraph quills solve a lot of it
		Anticipatory Strike, from CP, is kind of interesting: http://therafim.wikidot.com/anticipatory-strike
		Concussion Blast is a decent blasting power
			~1d6 force dmg per 2 pp, but no save or attack roll, extra target per 2 pp, and can choose nonlethal dmg
	5th
		Hail of Crystals
		Incarnate
			Along with Psychic Reformation weirdness to make use of it, and then get rid of it
			Minimum manifester levels to use this with various powers may mean you want to delay getting and using this
				Saves XP not to get and remove it multiple times, albeit a miniscule amount
				Still, the moment you get access to it it, you can get some solid value for reasonable XP
				Actually, Overchannel probably works with this! You have a lot more available to you faster than you'd think.
		Major Creation
		Plane Shift, Psionic
	4th (for the one more you'll need at lvl 9):
		Dimension Door
			Won't get another telepot until 8th level spells
				And can always use reformation then
			Neat additional augmentations in complete psionic
		Death Urge
			Great will save targeting offensive power
			Damages and disables
		Quintessence
			Weird outlet for excess power points
				Fabricate will already consume a good amount of that downtime excess
		Nothing in Complete Psionic seems even decent
	Glyph of Warding, Psionic (CP)?
		Material cost seems to apply, making it less attractive, but still good
		Eh, you can pay people to do this, and material components means you won't be using it randomly on adventures
			Though you might be able to embed nastier things than the average cleric
	Vigor and Share Pain?
		Combined with the psicrystal's ability to share your personal range powers, this effectively doubles the HP bonus
		Probably only worthwhile if you really have powers to burn, which is unlikely
			The astral constructs are already tanking for you, as is Conor
			Vigor is only 1 minute per level anyways

Interesting Skills (Constructor gets 2 more points than Psion! Psychic Reformation can adjust them later!):
	This skill trick is great: https://dndtools.net/feats/complete-scoundrel--60/collector-stories--3280/
		2 skill points for +5 compentence when using any trained knowledge check "to identify a
		creature or to learn its special powers or vulnerabilities"
		TAKEN!
	Profession(Pilot):
		Airships!
		Eh, probably not worth much, due to limited applications of airships without enchantments powering them
		Maybe a few ranks, so you can Minor Creation hangliders and occasional aerial weapons platforms
	Craft skills (none of which are likely worth it to you, now, at high level):
		Craft(Weaponsmithing):
			It includes crossbows!
			Lots of metal, so it needs Fabricate or Major Creation
		Craft(Sculpture):
			Fancy constructs, and some Complete Psionic content requires it, though most of that you don't want
		Craft(Food) and/or Craft(Brewing):
			Interesting social possibilities, preparing feasts and such for people
			Especially interesting depending on what happens after duration/dismissal
				Do people suddenly have room for more? Suddenly sober up?
				We seem to have established that they're nourished/affected if they manage to digest it before dismissal
		Craft(Boatbuilding):
			Under Stormwrack rules (pg. 84), this covers Huge or smaller vessels
				The largest of which is a Pinnace for DC 20, the highest listed DC

Potential Successors:
	-Phrenic Bard, with a one level dip into Marshall?
		-Good option for a social focus, and the +4 Cha mostly negates the level adjustment if
		 skills is what you really care about.
		-Level adjustement buy off could make this even more attractive.
		-Marshall lets you double the Cha bonus applied to skills that use it.
		-Human or Half-Elf? Latter is in the running for their racial +2 to Diplomacy.
	-Rogue instead of Bard?
		-More skill points and good abilities. Probably more attractive if you're not going to have
		 enough Bard levels for it's spellcasting to be much good. More dip-compatible.
		-Shadowdancer? Maybe with more dimensional/planar theming?
			-Possible for a bard too, though less advantageous than with sneak attack.
			-Clashes a bit weirdly with both Marshal auras and bardic music, both being audible.
				-Telepathy, or maybe even whispering, would work around it for the Marshal, and
				 Marshal aura probably works _for yourself_ regardless.
				-Yeah, actually, self is mostly what you want it for, and even then for out of combat.
			-Has Bluff and Diplomacy as class skills.
			-Hmm. . . Spring Attack doesn't actually affect spellcasting. There is Mobile Spell-Casting,
			 but do you even need anything more than your normal move action to hide after casting?

				https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/complete-adventurer--54/mobile-spell-casting--1973/
			-Unlikely that more than one level is worth it, though. _Maybe_ two.
		-Spymaster could be good for a dip, or maybe even more:
			http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/spymaster/index.html
		-Guild Thief would be amazing, but is 3.0:
			http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/guild-thief/index.html
		-Psionic Weapon and it's related stuff would be good, but has min. Str 13:
			https://dndtools.net/feats/expanded-psionics-handbook--65/psionic-weapon--2290/
		-Or the ranged version of that? How do ranged sneak attacks work?
			-It requires Point Blank Shot, and sneak attacks just have to be from <= 30'
		-Craven is a solid sneak attack feat:
			http://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/champions-of-ruin--27/craven--484/index.html
		-Ranged?
			-The Hide skill's description is generally interesting, but the language of the sniping
			 bit is problematic. Not clear that moving from where you are avoids th -20.
	-Archivist/Erudite into custom Divine/Psionic version of the Cerebremancer?
	-Druid would be fun.
	-Ah, we talked about the next campaign a bit during our last session of the former one.
		-Talked about an aquatic game, and about starting at level one.
			-Both make the druid a bit more attractive.
			-Jake did mention doing something to allow level adjustement if need be, though. Maybe
			 taking one flaw per point of LA.
