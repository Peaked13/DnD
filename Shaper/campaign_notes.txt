9/16/17:
	-Got a job trying to find runaway noble kid, working for House Nather
		-5 went missing, but employer only cares about his kid
		-Other families are also offering smaller rewards
			-Administered through town guards
		-Rewards are for live recovery
		-They left on some orc slaying adventure, with Darin ****, dwarven orc slaying hobbyist
		-Before leaving, were accosted by goons of House Leiyraghon
			-Rivals of our employer
			-Captured one, and interrogated him with help from House Natale's dwarven mercenaries
				-Said his employers are in league with the orcs in some fashion
				-Reported all of this to our employer, suggesting he work with the Natales, against
				 Leiyraghon, in the city while we're gone
			-I think I recall hearing they had a kid missing too
				-Wonder what happened there, given that they appear to have handed the group over
				 to orcs
	-Passed an orc ruin we may want to explore later, on our way North following the noble kids
	-Found Darin dead, along with evidence the kids were captured by orcs
	-Captured an orc after the boar encounter
		-Will interrogate at start of next session
			-Uh, did we forget all about this?
				-Don't recall anything about it in the second session


10/14/17:
	-Met with a half orc ranger in the woods, promising him some money in exchange for info on the
	 orc stronghold, which he provided
		-He gave the info, with promise of payment back in town
		-The info was good
	-Snuck into the stronghold disguised as orcs
		-Poisoned their bathroom
		-There's a sleeping wyvern in the courtyard
			-Eventually kill it, as I can make it into very valuable poison
		-Found a room down in the basement where some kind of ritual was happening
			-Killed many orcs in the process, so they certainly know something is up
			-Paused the session there
			-Will likely find the missing kids there.
				-Orcs kept mentioning them in the context of the ritual
	-Don't think we got XP for this session yet
		-I believe Jake gave the justification that we wouldn't be leveling up in the middle of a fight anyways.


12/2/17:
	-Rescued the kids
		-Orcs had been getting ready to sacrifice them to something, and were guarded by demons
		-Brought each back to their respective family
			-Nathers didn't want to hold hostage the Leiyraghon kid

				-Included at least:
					-A letter from House Burrell giving free passage on a ship
		-Got an invite to (obvious trap) dinner with House Leiyraghon
	-Left much of the orc stronghold unexplored and filled with enemies


1/1/18:
	-Attended trap dinner at House Leiyraghon's house
		-Dinner was hosted by Dornig Leiyraghon (patriarch), Kalman Leiyraghon (kid we rescued),
		 and Bremen Leiyraghon (heir and dick)
		-Bremen let in a bunch of orcs, who shot his father
			-Seems to have been in league with them for the kidnapping, or at least in favor of his brother being gone
			-Likely sent the Leiyraghon goons from earlier
				-Should we look into this, or mention it to his father?
			-If he remains a problem, we could also try siccing those dwarves on him, at their
			 legendary orc slayer, Darin, is dead due his treachery

			-Also a captured orc
			-Got no real reward beyond orc loot
		-Kalman followed us out, asking us to take him to sanctuary with House Nather
			-We delivered him, and the story of what happened, to them

				-Does he think his father can't protect him, or won't?
	-House Nather offered a new mission, putting down some separatists in a trading town North of Thar and Xûl-Jarak
		-Reward was unspecified, though they both cited their previous payment for the return of
		 the kid and said they would offer greater payment for both thoroughness and speed of
		 putting down the separatists
		-We accepted, and set out using horses they provided us

			-Used in creating Warforged
				-This particular one was involved in creating especially powerful warforged, but at the

					-Thranton agrees
		-Thranton thinks lady is not human, and does not trust her

	-Found our likely target, a tower across a ravine from town, connected by bridge
	-We tried to stealthily climb up to the bridge, but were spotted
	-We assaulted the bridge, but were driven off by the guards, along with two summoned hippogriffs
	 from an unknown source
	-We made our way back to the cave to rest again, for our next assault in The Seige of Glister

		-Learned, from Renar, how Warforged were made
			-Built by the clerics of Onithar (sp?), NG god of artifice, fire, and crafting
		-Renar examined the artifact
			-The Soul Conduit
				-Looks like a pipe with a sharp end, driven into skulls
			-It was a device definitely *not* made by clerics of Onithar
			-Related to practice that combines artifice with flesh
				-Blasphemous
				-Treated like necromancy
			-Uses souls to power powerful constructs
				-Rumors of warforged dragons made with such items

5/9/19:
	-Fought a battle with the gnolls, outside the walls of Xûl-Jarak
	-I sent many astral constructs with censors filled with burning othur over the walls, into various buildings
		-It's what drove them out, to fight us outside the walls
		-It deals constitution *drain* for it's primary damage. Other gnolls damaged, even far into the future?
	-Defeated, among others, a very large and well armed one
		-Still need to split the loot from this: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/578724855613095956
			-Consolidated it with other loot, from 5/24. Look at that link.


5/16/19:
	-Cleared the top two levels of the fortress and started down into the basement
		-Skipped over our previously looted tomb, on the way down, so we should return to clear that
		-Didn't loot anything on the way since the battle on the bridge
			-Can return at our leisure, after clearing the place, to take 20s everywhere
	-Following a 7 pt. astral construct down into the basement, we left off with it having started

		-Kursk One-tusk united the 5 tribes of Thar, conquering the region and building Xûl-Jarak
		-They also describe demons driving dwarves out of the area


6/6/19:
    -Went to the orcish ruins between Xûl-Jarak and Melvaunt
	    -Consisted of some ruined towers and a cave
    -Old tracks suggested a battle that drove some humanoids into the cave
    -The cave thus far contains orc corpses and scavengers
	    -Giant stag beetles, a black pudding, and some centipede swarms we left off in the middle of fighting
    -Heard both water and mining noises coming from the area to the South, though we haven't yet been able to investigate

    -Down in the lower level of these caves, we encountered skums mining
        -They escaped into an underground river that appears to flow in the general direction of Xûl-Jarak
        -They appear to have been mining cold iron, with the cave having veins of both that and regular iron
        -The cave and ruins are about a day and a half's travel overland from the fortress
    -River also had a Chuul within it
    -The dead orcs in the cave appear to have been killed by the bugs we fought
    -Elle is taking off
        -Beyond her herself, her character has also decided she's spent too long in one spot and must hit the road
		-I encouraged her character (and herself, life permitting) to drop in anytime she's near:
			-https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/589238052027760640
    -Loot is in Discord
        -Elle will still be taking a share

	-Set out to visit the tomb and dragon
	-Ambushed by orcs while sleeping along the way
	-Captured one of the orcs
		-Claims they sought new powers to defeat _us_
			-A blackguard named Xavgold came and now leads them
			-The powers came from a demon known as Mandarth
				-Xavgold is his lieutenant
		-Their camp is 3 days NW of the fortress
			-Gave us the exact location
			-A war camp
			-Has palisades, but not a real fortress
			-Roughly 30-40 blood orcs are there
		-They captured our ranger buddy!
			-His pet got away
			-They summoned an inquisitor to interrogate him
				-It's some class of demon
		-They're gathering information for an attack, though still in the planning phases
			-Shoring up their numbers, sending out scouts, interrogating the ranger
	-Got a magic telegram, via the quill, saying Joe is on his way and arranged to meet him along the road to Glister


7/3/19:
	-Met up with Joe and headed to the orc war camp
	-On the way, an ogre *tried* to ambush us in a canyon
		-Insignia suggested he was a member of the Skullcrushers, a tribe of ogres in the area
			-We're on the outskirts of their territory
	-Managed to rescue our buddy from the camp, but enemy forces were overwhelming
		-Substantial damage to the demon, probably the inquisiter, is what caused them to turn back with a promise of an
		 attack on the fortress later
	-Left off just as the enemies turned back
		-Left 5(!) constructs behind causing havoc
		-Combo of that, losses, burned supplies, and such should at least delay an attack on the fortress


7/17/19:
	-We did indeed have time to visit the tomb and dragon on the way back
	-Haravak described a large white dragon
		-Based on Renar's Knowledge(Arcana) check, it's like a young adult or adult
	-The area was cold enough to warrant survival and fortitude checks
		-The cultists may have warm clothes we can "borrow"
	-Found a small door that had been forced open, leading to narrow tunnels
	-Haravak warned us the dragon had cultists and indeed there were
		-They know we were here after we failed to quietly take out a patrol, just inside the door
		-Killed a band of them
	-Killed the dragon
		-You need to part it out
			-Mount head at fortress
			-Scales and bones for crafting
			-Gallblader for dragon bile poison
			-The bile or some other caustic substance to etch the psicrystal
				-Probably not taking more dragon aura related feats but, eh, still have one and still is cool
	-You need to do loot for the whole place and XP
		-*Might* have been unexplored sections, but not clear form the map (could just be alcoves or visual artifacts from mapmaking)
		-Search for traps first, than for loot (was one on the door, and in the false tomb at fortress)
		-We took care of it: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/603380604846735400


8/7/19:
	-Found, in the dragon's chamber in the tomb, magic statues
		-They're each tied to a school of magic, as indicated by inscriptions
			-Abjuration (the one with damaged inscriptions)
			-Divination
			-Evocation
			-Transmutation
		-They're activated by casting a spell of the matching school on them
	-They appear to be tied to a magic portal
		-It, in turn, is related to a "shadow leyline"
		-It seems like we may be able to manipulate the portal to travel to different points along the leyline
			-Orcish inscriptions mention the location of the tomb, Xûl-Jarak, and two unknown places, Shagol and Azuk
		-After activating all the statues, it opened a portal that then allowed someone with +4 intbonus to use the
		 bracer to travel to any known point on the leyline
			-Unknown locations seemed like a possibility to, with some chance of missing
		-We then traveled back to the fortress
	-Conor and Joe are going to head to town, selling items, bringing stuff back, and doing some of their own stuff
	-Renar and I will remain at the fortress, doing crafting related stuff and sorting out the order for Melvaunt

Downtime before next session:
	-Extra hirelings:
		-The scouts, and thus archers?
			-2nd level ranger would be great, as they get their first combat style bonus
				-4 sp./day if same as 2nd level mercenary, but those are warriors and this is a player class
			-Got a ruling: https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/609512337485070346
				-Rather expensive
				-Jake suggested negotiating parts of the deal: https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/609774836553875468
		-Equipment:
			-They come with their own, and don't need any of this after all: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/609819267386572817
			-Do you still have extra leather armor?
				-Shit, you don't seem to have written down the new equipment for the existing guards
					-Here is where we first talked about it in chat: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/595426128903274518
					-It's also on the equipment spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DVroD8YaTENIxQ-GjJXygxzlT0HtgrMbL9gQiiSNBxg/edit#gid=109774102
					-Ah, here is where we bought it: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/591452068309368832
				-Looks like we did get at least 40 sets: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/586990212605804597
			-What else do they need?
				-Longbows: 100/3 = 33.33 each
				-Bucklers: 
				-More arrows?
					-Eventually, but we've got the cold iron ones for now, plus extra mundane ones
				-Other outdoors-y stuff, they should be able to cover themselves, if they're rangers
					-Hunt an animal and turn it's skin into a water skin, etc.
		-Proposed 9 here, asking for skill checks to determine the reasonableness: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/609811050115629221
	-Cold iron arrowhead crafting:
		-You talked about this previously; search "grains"
			-You did the math here: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/597117376055607329
		-So, enough cold iron for 1,050 arrowheads, by your estimate
			-The rest of the material is the same as a normal arrow, and thus costs at most 1/3 of a gp. per 20
				-So, max 1050/20/3 = 17.5 gp.
		-Jake previously said the DC for arrows is 12, same as simple bows: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/595772209440489483
			-I don't see anything about the DC for cold iron being in any way higher: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialMaterials.htm
		-Should we order materials for making more?
			-We're at 20 per person or so for existing mercs, and we're thinking of hiring more
				-Cost is double so 2/3 gp. to craft 20
		-Bought the materials for 2100 in total, minus some cost for the existing cold iron
	-Construction projects:
		-Arrow hoardings?
			-Came up with a plan: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/609939208332902410
			-Bought the wood for it on 8/14
				-1000 gp. worth, or enough for 3 stronghold spaces
			-Drew an example: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/611364598112845883
			-Maybe one less or so, to also seal breach in wall with temp. wood
		-Look through stronghold guide for pricing
			-Will save having to know volume of wood per gp. or some such
		-What kind of quarry output can you obtain?
			-Asked a question about it here: https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/609798839817338952
			-Jake did some rolls and I got 62 gp. worth of stone over 6 days of 10 laborers quarrying: https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/609825256609415218
	-Proposed party spend:
		-3 stronghold spaces worth of wood: 1000
		-2100 Cold Iron Arrows (using found iron for half): 35+35/2
		-Total immediate per person: (1000+35+35/2)/4=263.13


8/14/19:
	-Upon our return to the fortress, via portal, we found Geppetto, the gnome who reactivated Renar, along with Renar's new cohort, Ned
	-Melvaunt seems to have seen probing raids from bands of orcs
		-Many more guards on the walls, outlying towns mostly empty, guards questioning travelers at the gates
	-Reported the massing of orcs to House Nather, and their demonic backing
		-Was introduced to their spymaster, Akkar
			-An elf
		-He wanted us to replace the orders of some soldiers working for another house, to push them away from engaging nearby tribes
			-The other house is interested in conquest, when they should be preparing for the orcish threat
	-Ran into a child pickpocket, and caught him trying to grab my purse
		-Let him go
		-He offered to spy for us, if needed, but we didn't really take him up on it
	-Did some shopping
		-Magic items for Joe and I
		-The wood and arrow materials
		-Also arranged our 9 rangers
	-We tracked down the soldier with the orders, and Joe successfully replaced them
	-Reported that back to Akkar
		-He gave us 4,000 gp. and offered to help with fortress defense planning
		-Seemed to sign off on us having a chance, at least
		-Said not all orcs are likely to be augmented with demonic powers
		-Warned us demons will, if in danger, summon more dangerous fellows
			-Finish them quickly!
	-We headed home the next day


9/4/19:
	-The army of "orcs" attacked the fortress
		-There were many demons, and a few demonic orcs driving the dretch foot soldiers forward
		-Beyond the inquisitor we encountered earlier, there was also a orcish demon thrall leading
		 them, his body twisted into demonic scales, like living plate armor
			-The inquisiter is a bone demon
	-You defeated the demons, with only the turned-invisible inquisiter, and a handful of dretches, escaping
	-Still need to do loot and XP
		-Done
	-Other questions to answer as to the outcome of the battle: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/619031117084753940
		-Got all the answers save the gate


9/11/19:
	-Cast some divinations the morning after the battle
		-I myself asked, "How should we find the bone demon inquisitor who led an army against us?"
			-Recieved "Between two doors. Seek the little purple man."
		-"How should we best slay the demon?", reworded by the psicrystal to, "How should we most artfully slay demon?"
			-"Make a tapestry from his skin."
				-Psicrystal may now try and insist on this.
				-Wait, do bone demons have skin? What is this, a Zen Koan?
	-There was a feast with a rousing speech by Joe, and food by me
		-Prevented recruitment penalties
	-We sent messages back to House Nather
		-We fought the demon/orc army, more demons than orcs.
			-They responded that many orcs still raid the roads.
			-We promised to setup patrols
				-Figure out these details during downtime
		-We request your aid hiring replacements for our casualties.
			-They set servants to the task
				-Again, figure out exact details in downtime, updating the spreadsheet as necessary
		-We also request a message be passed to the proprietor of the Wand and Griffin, in turn to his
		 business partner Thranton. We seek the bone demon inquisitor who led the army against us. He
		 fled invisible into the night, and we hope to find him "between  two doors". Do you know what
		 this means, or how we might find him?
			-Thranton teleported to the throne room
	-Thranton told us that the shadow ley line, through Thar, is also linked to the first level of The Abyss
		-By interrupting a teleport on the ley line, you can perform a ritual in the no-space to reach The Abyss
		-He suggested they may be seeking artifacts to travel between layers of the Abyss, seeking advantage in The Blood War
			-He also suggested we may be able to fake one, using it as a trap or lure
				-Perhaps even convincing them they've got what they came for (though maybe it blew up) 
	-Thranton also expressed interest in perhaps opening a shop at the fortress, should traffic increase
	-We also talked him into a 10% discount
		-On our quills, certainly, maybe in general
	-Ordered wood for a new gate, already paid for
	-Headed to Melvaunt for fake artifact research
		-On the way, scoped the orc and road security situation
			-40 to 50 of them seem to still be out there
			-They seem to lack organized leadership
			-Mostly plaguing the area West of Melvaunt, towards Phlan
		-Wizards there mentioned their research into the soul conduit bore fruit
			-It was of demonic origin, part of a trio of artifacts
				-One each dealing with mind (the conduit), space, and time
				-Perhaps the space component is what they were seeking?
					-They described what it should look like but are unsure of it's function: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/621533104179511306
			-Once together, they have some greater function
			-Suggested that, with time, they could research details to help us fake the artifact
				-Alternately, reclusive wizards might be able to help more, and they told us of one
				 who makes his home above the Galena mountains, in a floating tower
					-His name is Qebras
				-Magic items from Thar might provide clues
					-Mechanically, donating stuff to the wizards, instead of selling it, can speed up their research
	-Instructed laborers to drag the ballistas up to the walls
		-This has locations: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/621533088681426963
	-Stuff to do with downtime:
		-Mention to Jake we should probably pay their cost at some point
		-Setup road patrols
			-With existing, or hire still more?
				-Existing, for now
			-Use one set of gatehouse shifts, plus the rangers for it
				-18 people in total
			-Perhaps 2 patrols
				-9 in each ensures pretty minimal danger to them from the 40-50 disorganized orcs
					-The orcs are likely in smaller bands groups than that, and our mercs are somewhat
					 tougher than the average orc
				-One group gets an extra ranger, while the other gets an extra 3rd level warrior
				-Covers less ground than smaller patrols, but each group has 4 or 5 rangers to scout,
				 finding an orc band for the large group to hunt
		-Give a hard look at items to buy, and if waiting for the +6 headband really is worth it
			-Shit, crafting it seems *almost* reasonable. 18,000 gp. and 1440 XP.
			-After thought, it really seems like it is the next thing to get
				-Getting it several adventures earlier isn't likely worth the XP, though


9/18/19:
	-Hunted some orcs while waiting for Qebras
		-Caught a band that had ambushed a caravan, slaying all of them
		-Inside the ruined wagon, we found expensive textiles along with a ring with a House Bruil signature
			-On good terms with Bruil, we reported the loss to them, and they gave us 3/4 the value of the stuff recovered
	-Made a deal with Qebras
		-Hunt down a lone mindflayer, bringing it back dead or alive
			-Bonus for alive
				-Poisons sound like a solid option for that
					-Either ones that actually cause unconsciousness, or which do mental ability damage
					-Still, bit of a long shot: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/624084983518330882
		-It has taken over an old shrine to Blibdoolpoolp, god of the Kuo-toa
	-Use your downtime to plan the assault on the mindflayer
		-Cast divinations
			-Requested question suggestions from the party here: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/624090752355401728
			-Possible questions:
				-Why is the mindflayer at the temple?
					-Safety from his kind he did seek, in the temple he traps the weak.
				-Why is the mindflayer alone, away from it's kind?
					-Heretical studies drove his action, for this he was driven from his faction.
				-How could we approach the mindflayer undetected by it?
					-Act as food and steel your will, attack when he goes to eat his fill.
				-How does the mindflayer trap the weak at the temple?
					-Domination
				-Would the mindflayer be vulnerable to the blue whinnis poison?
				-Specifics about how best to attack, sneak up on it, incapacitate it, etc.
		-Can we really take it alive?
			-Possible poisons:
				-Blue whinnis for secondary unconsciousness?
					-Secondary damage implies surviving *10 rounds* against a mindflayer, though
				-Deathblade to reduce con, and thus fortitude, to make vulnerable to other poisons?


9/25/19:
	-Renar crafted some scrolls to help resist the mindflayer
		-I paid for a copy each of Protection from Evil (5 minutes) and Clear Mind (20 minutes)
	-We set out for the temple, in Kua-toa infested marshes
	-We found a likely looking cave, and buffed at the entrance
		-I created 11 gallons of 11 hour Black Lotus Extract, and cast Inertial Armor
		-Renar cast Clear Mind for all of us at the entrance of the cave
			-Protection from Evil and the shape change too, outside the temple door
	-Cleared out some Kuo-toa, and then cornered and killed the mindflayer
		-In doing so, we freed his enslaved elf, who we still need to find out more about
			-His name is Oristel
			-He has dim memory of his 6 months enslaved by the mindflayer
			-Seems like he can hold his own in a fight
				-6th level rogue who will work at cost of 3rd level one, in gratitude
					-Jake mentioned spymaster would be a good fit
					-Asked Jake the price, and he said 1 gp. per level, or 3 for this guy
			-He agreed to come back to the fortress with us, giving him a place to stay while
			 he puts his life back together
		-Jake will post loot and XP in downtime
			-Done


10/9/19:
	-Delivered the mindflayer corpse to Qebras, calling him with the arranged signal
	-Holding up his end of the deal, he proposed overloading an item known as a Warp Marble,
	 to create our explosive deception
		-He doesn't have one, but knows where one can be found
		-He directed us to a fallen tower of frost, created by Vorbyx, the first king of Thar
			-Vorbyx is also what his lost race is called today, after him
			-They're rumored to have left behind a powerful artifact, but we know little about it
				-Could maybe research it
		-The tower is on a frozen lake, a day and a half southeast of Glister
			-Qebras pointed it out on a map
		-It is now controlled by an ogre mage
	-With the marble, Qebras can overload it, but then we'll need to provide an antimagic field to stabilize it
		-With one of us casting the field, we can then release it when we want the device to explode
	-Qebras teleported us back to Melvaunt, where we sold some loot
	-We then set out for the tower, dropping off our new elf rogue-like buddy at the fortress on the way
	-Outside it, we slew a patrolling giant, without apparent notice from the tower


10/16/19:
	-We invaded the top level of the tower, the only bit projecting out from the frozen lake
	-There, we fought giants, ogres, and a hydra
	-We might want to take a break, run a ways off, and rest
		-I, at least, am super low on power points


11/13/19:
	-We did indeed rest, creating some fake rubble with Minor Creation to hide a room behind a fake cave-in
	-During the night, the ogre mage reanimated most of what we fought as undead
	-Slew the creatures again, and the damned ogre mage too
	-Looted the whole building, as those seem to be the last things alive (or "alive")
		-Found the Warp Marble


11/20/19:
	-We headed back to Melvaunt, to sell our loot
	-At The Wand & Griffin, we saw the proprietor arguing with a cloaked figure as we entered
		-Joe identified his neck tatoos, saying he's a member of The Black Syndicate
			-A local guild of thieves and assassins
			-Apparently the shopkeep has borrowed money from him
	-We sold our loot, and also did somewhat weirder stuff
		-Joe and I both put 10% downpayments down on +6 attribute enhancers, strength for him, intelligence for me
			-I asked him to let me know when he's able to obtain one, via our telegraph quill with House Nather
			-Well, 3,600 towards it, anyways. With our discount, it should only be 32,400, so we need to come up with
			 28,800.
				-I'm about 3,000 away: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/646925760866680833
		-Renar also asked after some expensive reagents (with which to create a Portable Hole)
		-Conor paid to shrink a Large Greataxe +2
	-Met with the wizards at the library
		-They'd done further research on our artifacts
		-Mentioned they'd once been more powerful
			-It appears to have been reduced through psionics somehow
		-Also mentioned that they learned something of the last emperor of that great old empire
			-It's widely believed the last emperor destroyed the empire attempting to become a lich
			-Instead, they believe he had been trying to awaken an elder evil
				-Something the celestials appear to have attempted to surpress knowledge of
			-The mages have been seeking a tome with knowledge concerning this, in large part to keep it safe
				-It is believed to be located on an island off the coast of this continent, a long journey from here
				-We'd be interested in seeking this out at some point, but might want to wrap up the warp marble stuff
		-We also looked into if a Globe of Invulnerability that Renar can manage would work for the antimagic needed
		 with the marble
			-After a Knowledge (Arcana) check, sounds like it would suffice to contain it for a minute or so
		-We also checked a bounty board there, where wizards seek magical items and creatures
			-We saw a bounty for a "Cauchemar nightmare" in The Ride, North of Thar
				-Bring back it's tail, as proof of the existence of the rumored creature
					-Ask Jake about the value
			-There was another for a lich in the South of Thar
				-Bring the remnants of his phylactory as proof of his destruction
					-Ask Jake about the value
				-Useful to us too, as we've a definite interest in pacifying Thar
			-And another for the leader of a cult
				-Bring his head, with it's distinctive (and probably magical) forhead tatoos
					-Worth 500 platinum
				-Chaos cultists worshipping vecna
				-Have been causing chaos around Melvaunt, including a forest fire and earthquakes
					-They may be druids/ecoterrorists
	-Left a message with Qebras's favorite magic shop
		-Said we have the item he sought, and that, should we miss him, he can contact us via House Nather
	-We then began investigating the Vecna cultists, they being nearby, and we having ~5 days before Qebras is likely
	 come through (edit: we actually had a shortcut)
		-Renar's religion knowledge suggested Vecna is opposed by creator deities, and we went off in search of one
		 revered by the warforged, of which Ned is fond
			-Onitar (sp?)
			-Asked them about the cultist, saying we were interested in bringing them to justice
			-The cleric mentioned a cave they seem to be basing themselves out of, though they've established
			 magical obstacles in the surrounding area
				-3 days travel away
	-Called Qebras, through his magical stone, meeting him at a nearby restaurant
		-He explained we'd need to identify the demon lord who is pursuing us
		-They generally exist immaterially, keeping their physical bodies on the first level of The Abyss
			-Destroying our enemy's body with the destabilized warp marble will disband his army
			-The idea is to get our trap to the body by disguising it as a fake artifact, getting one of it's
			 servants to bring it to it's master's cache
		-Our 1 minute from the Globe of Invulnerability won't cut it, but Qebras thinks we can find a way to
		 extend that
			-He's going to look into it
		-In the immediate term, he had an idea as to how to track down our enemy
			-He is willing to summon and bind a demon lieutenant, that we can interrogate him
				-A glabrezu
				-Qebras won't be there, as he doesn't want this shit on him
				-Don't break the binding circle around it, crossing it or smudging it
				-We can also activate Qebras's magic stone, to signal him to banish it
	-We went back to Qebras's lab
		-The museum had an orc with a tail like Dog's, and Qebras gave Dog the trader's name
			-He traveled The Ride, selling strange corpses
		-He also mentioned he wants to get a beholder for it
	-We began the interrogation
		-Our enemy's common name is Balaros, who makes his home on the 43rd level of The Abyss
		-He even drew us a map/coordinates (Ned is terrifying, and has sick burns)
	-Qebras kindly teleported us back to Melvaunt, where we'll be pursuing those cultists next time, while
	 waiting to hear back from Qebras as to options for extending the antimagic
		-Also asked about it via Divination, between sessions: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/646934599036960769
			-Heard back: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/647231374058848256
				-Forwarded that along to Qebras, to see if he has ideas, but didn't yet hear anything
				-Raise the above, and maybe do some research of your own
					-Renar's arcane knowledge and the Melvaunt library?


-12/4/19
	-Looked into the divination
		-Qebras said he'd get back to us
		-Knowledge local found rumors of mage hunters that established such towers
		-Knowledge(Geography) and consulting with the university suggested such sites can be found in The Tortured Lands,
		 North of The Ride
			-A broken land of lava flows carved by later glaciers
			-Settlements established by adventurers and the like exist on the outskirts
	-Set out to find those cultists, wherever the cleric of Onitar told us to look
		-2 days away
		-Once in the general vicinity, we relied on Dog to help us track them
	-While sleeping in a quick structure fabricated, some elves attempted to burn it down
		-Interrogating the one left alive at the end, they wanted to drive us out of their territory
		-He seemed to know where the cultists were, a cave guarded by various elementals
		-He agreed to take us there in exchange for his life


-1/1/20 ("The Mystery of the Suspicious Log"):
	-With the location of the cultist's hideout in hand, we headed there to find their leader.
	-It turned out to be a shaped and enchanted tangle of brambles and other plants.
		-Enchanted with ironwood on the outside, but less resiliant inside.
	-It was guarded by elementals, and a combination of flaming traps and a fire elemental led to us 
	 setting the damned place on fire.
	-We located the leader, a druid, in a cave below the brambles, and defeated him, severing his rune
	 covered head.
		-He shouted a lot about some elder evil, "Pandorym".
			-Low Knowledge(The Planes) rolls didn't tell us anything, so we should research further.
		-He ended up killing himself with Firestorm, trying to take us with him (a pathetic failure).
	-Jake will post XP and loot in Discord chat.
		-Did the XP in chat, and then loot next session


-1/15/20:
	-Loot to account for: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/667196190512644126
		-Interestingly, we got a jar, or part of it, that could be used to preserve and interrogate
		 the head of a dying enemy
			-You figured that out with Knowledge(Psionics)
			-Is that the "Brain Serum"? What's "Chaositech"?
				-Yep, that's the jar
				-It has a label on it saying Chaositech
			-You'll need to research it to use it. Jake mentioned that some form of psionic ritual
			 will likely be required
	-We severed the seared druid head, to bring back for the bounty
	-Joe reached us through the flames, after guarding the camp (explaining his absence last session)
		-He warned us there was company coming, others interested in the bounty
	-I Dimension Doored Conor, Joe, and myself out to the entrance
		-Renar, Ned, and my psicrystal were left behind, to be fetched by a second trip
			-Dimension Door at this level allowed one person less than we needed
			-Psicrystal allows communication
		-Four elves were waiting for us
			-They immediately drew their weapons
				-Joe also mentioned he'd spoken to them, and they weren't in the mood for further words
		-We fought and eventually slew them
			-I fetched Renar, etc. after a round or two
	-We rested and headed back to Melvaunt
		-This triggered my level up
	-On the way back, we got a message from Qebras, saying he had important news, and to meet him at the
	 usual shop in Melvaunt
	-Still need to do XP and elven adventurer loot
		-He posted both

-Stuff you should do as soon as you're back in in Melvaunt:
	-(Jake mentioned we'd maybe do our shopping during downtime, though that's waiting on loot from him.)
	-Claim the bounty
	-See if that Headband of Int is ready
		-Sounds like you'll narrowly be able to afford it
		-You _definitely_ can
	-If you then have the money to spare, get your crystal a belt
		-750 gp. to buy, or 500gp, 40 XP, & 1 day for Renar to make
			-That buy price doesn't even factor in your 10% discount
			-Buying is way preferable, and probably possible
	-Getting the power stones and buckler from our loot will cost you (50+175+4165)*(3/8)= 1646.25 of your take
		-As a result, you'll be getting 14454.25-2195=12259.25 (WRONG), bringing your total to
		 23310.46+12259.25=35569.71
		-If you get the headband and healing belt, you'll still have 35569.71-28800-750=6019.71
			-Not a bad quantity to save
			-Other stuff, though, that it might be time to get:
				-Mithral Chainshirt?
				-The Handy Haversack?
				-More power stones?
			-Get Quintessence power stone (700 gp) along with the Haversack (2000 gp)
				-If you can get them both from our favorite shop, your total cost is
				 then 28800 + (700+2700)*.9 = 31860, leaving you with 3709.71
					-That's a pretty good reserve
	-Research those foci, and see about buying them if you can't make them
		-Knowledge(Psionics)
	-Research "Chaositech" and the brain jar
		-Knowledge(Psionics)
	-Also research the druid's elder evil, Pandorym
		-Knowledge(The Planes), I think
	-Oh, we need to meet Qebras too!
	-YOU FORGOT THE CRYSTAL'S BELT!


-1/22/20:
	-The sky looks odd
		-We need to ask Renar for a Knowledge(Arcana) check (he was going to be late)
	-Meanwhile, we went shopping
		-The Wand & Griffin:
			-The proprietor is Scibder and his daughter is Felkap
			-Our stat boost items are in!
			-Sounds like he can also do the Haversack, but doesn't carry psionic stuff
				-He mentioned a psionics shop, but couldn't remember the name
				-Joe's and my Knowledge(local) check did, and the location
					-Mind Over Matter
		-Went to Mind Over Matter and picked up the Quintessence power stone
			-It's proprietor is a Xeph
	-It is apparently the 5th of Marpenoth (the 10th month of 12), 300 AC (after cataclysm)
		-The local elections are on 11/1/300
			-House Nather is doing well, exploiting recent military follies to pull ahead
				-It is still rivaled by House Bruil, currently their main rival, but they worry some
				 other grand spectacle could upset the matter
				-House Natale is doing well too
			-They requested we be in town for the election, to act as bodyguards
	-We went to the guard headquarters, to collect the bounty for that druid
		-Ominously, we're seeing runes in those strange clouds 
			-They seem to appear as the clouds pass over Melvaunt
		-Reward was 5000 gp.
	-We stayed at a dockside bar/inn
		-The Crow's Nest
		-The sailors within were talking about a pirate ship that has lately been raiding the coast
			-The pirates operate out of an abandoned mansion, overlooking the town of Balt, North 
			 of Melvaunt
				-Or so it's thought. The raids stop when the ship is seen near there, though the
				 seaside cliffs there offer many hiding places.
			-Balt is 3 days away from Melvaunt
	-As we left the inn, we were ambushed by a band of demons, led by that damned vrock
		-He surrounded the area in purple flames, isolating us
		-I forced the vrock to kill himself, which ended the flames
		-With the flames gone, and now assistance from both guards and Qebras, we made short work
		 of the rest
	-We're now off to meet with Qebras
	-Loot and XP will be posted in Discord
		-https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/670993176026415104

-Stuff you need to do:
				-Research those foci, and see about buying them if you can't make them
					-Knowledge(Psionics)
					-Arcana can also do it and maybe Qebras can help
				-Research "Chaositech" and the brain jar
					-Knowledge(Psionics)
				-Also research the druid's elder evil, Pandorym
					-Knowledge(The Planes), I think
				-Oh, we need to meet Qebras too!
					-That's more or less what we left off doing
				-YOU FORGOT THE CRYSTAL'S BELT!
					-750
						-10% discount
				-Get more power stones
					-Get:
						-Vigor (1)
						-Know Direction and Location (1)
						-Sense Link (1)
						-Share Pain (2)
						-Tongues, Psionic (2)
						-Body Adjustement/Purification (both 3)
						-Correspond (4)
						-Detect Remote Viewing (4)
					-Total cost: 25*3+150*2+375*2+700*2 = 2525


-2/5/20:
	-Qebras, after helping us kill demons, told us to meet him at his favorite shop when
	 we're ready for a journey
	-Got the above items
	-Renar tried Arcana for the sky, but didn't learn much
	-Then, we went to the library to research
		-Pandorym:
			-In a history of the old empire, we learned Pandorym was a spirit that once possessed
			 a warforged behemoth, a weapon of the empire
				-Apparently not the first manifestation of the spirit
					-Previously, clerics had attempted to create it an avatar and have it isolate the
					 material plane, to then be ruled by them
			-It was defeated by a dragon general and twelve legions of warforged
			-It was then banished to some other plane
				-Joe deciphered the name of that plane, a disused and unfamiliar words
				-This representation seems to include some kind of coordinates
			-After this, all but one warforged behemoth was dismantled
				-There had been twelve, one for each province
				-After, only one in the capitol was kept
					-Renar thinks he could figure out the location of the old capitol
			-We now have +5 towards Knowledge(Arcana) checks to figure out the sky's weirdness and can retry
		-Retrying sky arcana (rolled 35!):
			-The symbol in the sky is "a faint sign of doom", a seal of binding
			-It's affecting divination and summoning spells
				-They require spellcraft checks or they will failed
				-Further, banishment/dismissal stuff automatically fails
				-This affects psionics, but you get +2 on your psicraft checks, as it's not as effective
				 as against magic
		-Portable Hole components and where to find them:
			-39 on arcana for Renar
			-The necessary ingredients can be collected from the cubbies of planar spiders on
			 Panzunia, The Plane of Portals, 1st layer of the Abyss
				-Same place as the body of that demon lord we need to blow up
		-Planeshift Foci:
			-Material Plane:
				-Focus is a pencil sized gold rod
			-The First Layer of the Abyss (Panzunia, The Plane of Portals)
				-Each layer is it's own focus
				-Focus is a thorium rod
					-30 on Geography suggested it's found in the mountain homes of the dwarves,
					 knowlegable in rare metals as they are
					-We swung by that dwarven bar to ask around if they know where some could be
					 found
						-Spoke with a fairly drunk dwarf who claimed to have a cousin who dealt in
						 it
						-Last he heard, his cousin was in the dwarven city of Steelhammer
							-It's in a mountain range on the border of Krakya (the kingdom Melvaunt
							 is in) and Naven
							-240 miles to the South of Melvaunt
								-There is a sea route
				-This layer has a great trade city
					-Strangely, it's run by _devils_
						-The result of a half-enforced Blood War truce
			-Ethereal Plane (in this cosmos, known as The Shadow Plane):
				-Focus is a vial of alchemical smoke
					-Renar can craft it, at twice the price of his noxious smoke
			-The Astral Plane
				-Focus is a rod of platinum
			-Ysgard:
				-Focus is a rod of rose gold
					-"Rose gold is a blend, or an alloy of pure 24 karat yellow gold, copper and silver."
		-"Chaositech" and the brain jar
			-40 on Knowledge Psionics
			-Found a brand new relevant book, a recent research paper on the soul conduit we found
				-"Chaositech" is the technology of Chaos
					-An alarmingly powerful force, though considered an abomination. Many would sell
					 their soul for it's secrets, and often do.
					-It's thought to have some connection or origin with The Drow
				-You didn't find a defined ritual, but were able to piece something together you think
				 would work
					-10 min. casting time
					-500 gp. material cost
						-Various preservatives and psionically infused materials
					-Will preserve a living head in the jar
	-As we took the magic-elevator down from the planar section of the library, I ran into another
	 elan
		-He was looking for us, wanting me to meet with the elder elans in 1 week in the capitol
			-They want to talk about how to address the signs in the sky
			-He gave me a letter explaining the details
				-The capitol is about 3 days from us by sea
					-We have that free ship passage
	-We then met Qebras
		-He said he had info for us, and teleported us back to his museum
		-North of The Ride lies the Tortured Lands
			-They were the site of an ancient battle, predating even the Elcarian Empire
			-Torrents of elemental chaos still swirl above it
			-Qebras found an ancient document describing a tower, set up by an order of ancient
			 paladins to find some artifact, using an antimagic field
				-Some of the paladins were warforged, and may still live
					-If they do, they are still bound by their oath to protect the location until
					 the artifact they needed was unearthed
						-Perhaps, if we helped free them, they'd be willing to help us
				-Lines up with the divination I did
				-He had the general location of this tower
		-He then teleported us back to Melvaunt
	-We then redeemed our letters from House Bruil for passage on a ship to the capitol
		-They didn't seem too happy about it, on account of currently being rivals with Nather
		 in the elections
		-We leave in two days
	-While waiting for the ship to leave, you do some Fabrication and Quintessence making
		-https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/674826657948893199
		-Lets cheekily call it two Fabricate castings, one for metalwork and one for leather
			-Foci can be made with sprues or whatever, if need be
		-They cost you 14 PP, leaving you 76 from day-of-demon-battle and another 128 for the next day
		-Quintessence costs 7 each oz., so that's 10 castings the first day and 18 the next
			-Added it to your gear
	-Next session will start on the ship
		-Make sure to make Quintessence each night on the ship too!

-Maybe write up something for Jake about your background, since you're going to talk with other elans
	-Not sure what you've sent already. Thought there was a bulleted list somewhere, but maybe not.
	-Wrote up a bunch in background.txt, sending it all to Jake
-Ahh, Quintessence can stabilized the warp marble: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/675122506063151112
	-With that solved, you can pretty much leave for The Abyss whenever (and from where ever) you
	 get the thorium
	-Still save those paladins: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/675122618013188096
-Send a message to the fortress about what those laborers should be doing
	-Fortress should be about cleaned up
	-Have them do some quarrying
		-Once you open the basement, quarrying there also yields cellar space
	-Done: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/689997181725442132


-3/18/20 ("Ship in a Bottle"):
	-We boarded the boat and met both crew and an elvish spice merchant who would be accompanying us.
		-Christiana
	-I offered to cook a meal (using Minor Creation) for dinner, conferring with both the cook and
	 the spice merchant.
		-It was a hit.
		-Repeated the same the next day, making a special request for the cook.
	-Also spent some time talking shop with the sailors.
		-Got a +2 to use one one future Profession(Sailor) check.
	-Joe also went off in search of someone who may be smuggling drugs on the ship, but you don't
	 actually know anything about that.
		-Oh, he did let you in on the secret.
		-You worked with him on a plan to discover the culprit.
		-You attempted a Divination
			-First, it led to a seemingly unrelated vision: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/690026830266499127
				-The storms in Jake's verbal description surrounded a plane.
				-You're guessing it's related to Pandorym, and the goal of having it cut the
				 material off from the rest of the planes
			-The Divination to actually discover the culprit failed (you rolled shitily).
		-With Renar's help, you found the  Sunbeam, through detect magic.
		-Meanwhile, Conor distracted anyone he could get a drink into the hands of.
		-Riven, human crewman, was acting suspiciously throughout.
		-We brought the issue to the captain, who Joe trusted.
		-We rounded everyone up on deck and, with the help of Renar's Zone of Truth.
			-Riven was indeed the culprit.
			-He was working for a criminal organization known as the The Crimson Tree.
				-Apparently they have a tree house and he had a gambling debt.
			-The captain is going to turn him over to the crown when we reach the capitol.
	-One of the half orcs aboard knew of an orc with tail, on Rumug who had been aboard The Sunfish, a ship.
	-Next week will start with meeting the Elan Eternals.


-3/25/20:
	-Joe and Renar diced with a dwarf, the first mate
	-We arrived in the capitol
		-The captain turned the smuggler over to the guards
		-It's named Bellus
			-In ancient times, it was a colony of the old empire
		-Ruled by king Samir
			-Considered tough but fair
	-The ship will return to Melvaunt in 3 days, if we want a ride back
		-We left a good impression on the captain
		-Christiana too, who asked us to stop by her shop later
	-We went to visit the Elan Eternals
		-We looked through some ancient texts they were piercing together while waiting
			-Described the founding myth of the empire, a flood wiping out the unworthy and then a
			 virtuous 30 founded the city of Impirus at a site consisting of three hills
		-Among those at the formal meeting were Olfunso, Adalia, and Vallo
		-They indeed wished to talk about the threat from Pandorym, fearing we were about to be cut
		 off from the planes and our psionic powers both
			-Even that which sustains the Elans
			-Adalia had had a similar vision, though hers featured winged creatures, not interfering
			 but rather meditating
				-Asked if they could be demons, she said they were twisted things, and could have
				 been
			-They also mentioned a divination sphere, used by the greatest clerics and diviners,
			 suggesting it was the storm in the vision, for it has become clouded and dangerous
				-When it was last threatened, the gods created the Knights of the Last Oath, to
				 topple the emperor who was threatening it, the emperor from that history fragment
				 that kicked off the game (Hadrian IV)
			-They suggested we replace some failing planar nexus, gathering the requisite materials
			 here on the material plane, and than traveling to some prison island between the two
			 continents
				-The prison was once known as The Black Tower
					-Adalia smoke with a mercenary Jerad who recently passed near it, where he had a
					 vision of the tower restored as his ship passed near it
					-Though it exsist on the material, it is an inflection point between the celestial
					 and abyssal planes
				-Restoring the crystal will then cause a local disturbance in time, during which we
				 must defend it (against who knows what)
				-They gave us a list of components we'd require, though they make little sense without
				 extensive knowledge of geology
					-One critical component, a crystal, can only be obtained by slaying a saphire dragon
						-Such creatures are found in the upper levels of The Underdark
						-Must be at least an adult
							-We've got a _shot_ at killing such a thing
								-Jake: "On. . . a scale between 1 and 20, it's a 13" (lol)
					-The elans have the rest of the materials on hand
					-Saphire dragons
						-A psionic gem dragon
						-Most isolated and territorial of them
						-Militaristic, known for their strategy
							-They often keep companions/servants of many war like races
						-They lair in rocky caverns, keeping large spiders for their food
						-Their breath weapon does sonic damage
						-Immune to electricity
						-They also have powerful psionics
						-As far as finding one, they like the stability of mountains
							-A knowledge geography check suggested a possible site in the South of this
							 kingdom, near it's border with it's neighbor
							-They're hostile at the moment, though, and there are restrictions on
							 passing between them
							-They suggested we seek an Underdark entrance in this kingdom, and then head
							 South
							-They also suggested we seek the aid of dwarves in finding this dragon
				-Restoring the nexus will buy us time, after which we must seek the aid of the gods
					-Their intervention will be necessary to truly stop Pandorym
					-Hopefully this time they don't destroy an entire continent
		-Adalia had been doing some mapping of the old world lately, seeing which areas have been looted
		 and which still hold ancient treasures
			-The great dragons still hold their stronghold and are rumored to being grafting war forged
			 parts to themselves, to fend off the looters that seek their hoards
			-She also suggested that warforged, or hybrids therewith, might be better able to stand up
			 to travel through temporal portals than flesh
				-Some are said to have summoned great armies from the past in this way
		-Jake used a diagram of the D&D Great Wheel Cosmology, so that seems like our cosmology
		-The Pandorym cultists, known as Void Cultists, seek to isolate the material from the ethereal
		 and shadow planes
		-We headed to the dwarven city of Steelhammer
			-It is conveniently in the South of the kingdom and full of dwarves
			-Also, it's where that guy's cousin, the thorium dealer, lives
				-His name is Goric. We arrived outside his stall.
			-We contacted the drunk dwarf, asking him to describe Steelhammer, and then Adalia teleported
			 us there
				-She'll be joining us in this quest
			-Conor won a pig wrestling contest, and I had wisely bet on him, winning 90 gp.
				-Afterwards, he cavorted with dwarves, some of whom were guards
					-They told him of a nearby entrance to the Underdark, as well as the location
					 of a nearby Drow city and a beholder's lair
						-Qebras was looking for a beholder
						-Drow are known to sometimes keep planar spiders
			-You successfully divined "Where is the nearest saphire dragon?"
				-Jake will give the answer in Discord, as we ended the session here
					-Seek the the cavern where crystal covers the walls, find the entrance behind where the river falls
				-It triggered another vision:
					-Two great beings, locked in combat. A third figure sneaks between them, pulling
					 the land out from beneath them and causing them to fall into the void. Instead
					 of silence, there was chaos.


-4/3/20:
	-5 days since leaving Melvaunt
		-9 days until we need to be there for the election
	-15 on Knowledge(Geography), trying to find the cavern from the divination
		-You do know of a place, 80 miles to the West where the river Birtun disappears beneath
		 the mountains.
			-This could be the the falls the divination spoke of.
	-We picked up some scrolls of Resist Energy (Sonic)
	-After a day of travel, Adalia _attempted_ to teleport us home
		-However, it went arry, and we ended up at the tomb of Kursk One-tusk
		-Adalia seems to know things about leylines, though, and was able to work the portal there
		 that we once used to teleport to the stronghold.
			-We had used a bracelet found there, that we seem to have lost
	-We cleaned out the basement
		-Two "landsharks" (Bullettes?) and some fire-blooded spine wolf
	-Afterwards, we walled off the Underdark passage in the basement, NE of #39
		-Rolled 22 on the Knowledge (Arch&Eng) check
		-Thick stone wall and stone door, with stone bar
			-Sent Jake the stats for this, from Stronghold Builder's Guide: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/695856097097023489
			-Also assigned a guard patrol to it, to listen from inside for anything trying to break in
		-Places a Psionic Lock on it too
		-Also dispelled the Psionic Locks on the ground level doors to the basement, giving
		 staff access
	-Thanked Adalia for the basement help, telling her she's welcome at the fortress any time
		-She seemed interested, particularly in the leyline, but preoccupied with the threat of
		 Pandorym for the moment
	-We teleported back to where we left off, and headed to the falls
	-We found the mineshaft sometimes used by dwarven patrols to reach the area
		-It offered us a shaft down, which we used Feather Fall to descend
		-That then opened into a vast cavern containing an underground sea
			-The Glimmer Sea, a Knowledge (Geography) check recognized
				-Named for the glowing fungus that sporadically illuminates it
			-It's also what the river empties into
		-We left off drifting down towards this sea, which we know to be full of dangerous creatures.
			-Come up with good solutions.
			-Adalia can float a foot above the water
			-I can be cheaply carried by a construct, as can all but Ned and maybe Renar
				-They last minutes, though, at best, and this is a _sea_, not a puddle
			-I can conjure boats, but not quickly
				-Probably need an intermediate solution, if we do this
				-Doesn't necessarily protect much from aquatic predators
				-11 cubic feat at a time means a small boat
					-I can _probably_ manage a launch (Stormwrack pg. 101)
				-Make that launch masterwork?
					-Depends on how easily you can make a check of 20:
						-"The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of
						 armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20."
						-Your base for any Craft is 10 @ lvl. 11, but Renar can help lots


-4/8/20: The Princess Bride Episode
	-I summoned a masterwork launch, with edges lined in handles, as we drifted towards the sunless sea
		-We caught it and lowered it with us to the sea
	-Our not too quiet splashdown attracted some aboleths, who attacked out boat
		-They curiously probed it for a bit first, which gave us a bit of time to preparing
			-I made a bunch of black lotus extract, which our warforged dipped arrows in
		-There were quite a lot of them
		-We killed most of them, though Adalia got slimed
			-We're going to have to teleport somewhere with a powerful cleric and fix her rapid
			 onset aquatic adaptation
		-The rest took off after they failed to enslave anyone, after attempting all of us
	-Their retreat might have had something to do with the giant squid that attacked next
		-It after us as Conor rowed and an Astral Construct pushed
		-We had sighted some land and sent Renar's drone to it with a light
		-We delayed the sea monster a bit with Renar's wall of force
		-Eventually, we were close enough for Adalia and I to Dimension Door us all over to the land
			-Conveniently, it's at a cave that appeared to have been carved with rays, which Renar's
			 Arcana knowledge (plus a bit of prompting from Andy) identified as the likely lair of a
			 beholder
				-Sounds like we're collecting Qebras's bounty
		-Not content to leave a foe unfelled, I instructed my construct to begin splashing the boat
		 up and down in the water, and to attack anything that swallowed him
			-The boat that still contained gallons of black lotus extract. . .
			-That sea monster is no more.
			 
-After last adventure, you also described some conversations Edric held with Adalia, during the
 course of the last two adventures, concerning The Old World and the Thar ley line
	-https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/698964921462816870

-Fix Adalia's slime problem
	-Cure Disease or Heal and it's variants
	-Psychic Reformation into a new power, temporarily, is an option if we're somehow stuck
	-You fixed it
-Get or craft Concentration item for crystal (see Shaper.txt)
	-You ordered it, paying up front. It should be ready in a day.


-4/16/20:
	-Teleported back to Melvaunt, to get Adalia's aquatic affliction fixed
		-Spent her cash on a back alley cure. She's going to want a loot share.
	-While there we rested, leveled, and shopped
		-I replaced some jugs
		-I also inquired about stones for the powers I wish to replace
			-Three were available, and you got them:
				-Minor Creation (1)
				-Fabricate (4)
				-Divination (4)
			-Two weren't, but the Psi shop proprietor could craft them, given special crystals:
				-Major Creation (5)
				-Fabricate, Greater (6)
			-Conveniently, a Knowledge(Psionics) check of 35 suggested they could be found in the
			 cave of our sapphire dragon
				-A cave of deep crystal that possesses some degree of sentience and psionic power
					-You should be able to detect this cave if you get within a mile or so of it
		-I also commissioned my Concentration crystal, prepaying 3200
	-We teleported back to the Underdark, with only a minor mishap
		-Second trip dumped Ada, Renar, and I in some random spot in the ocean, where Renar was
		 almost carried off by some tentacle monster, but we teleported away.
	-I then constructed a goddamn airship via Minor Creation
		-Jake let me get away with some shit due via Arch&Eng checks
			-Abuse more of this
		-Something hot air balloon-like, using an alcohol burner to heat the air
			-Alcohol is a vegetable product. . .
		-I made a "DaVinci-style air screw", which Conor and our constructs turned the crank for
		-Require three castings in total, with fuel
	-We flew it toward the waterfall, where I detected the cavern psionically
	-We flew it the balloon through the waterfall
		-We were immediately grabbed by a purple worm
		-We slew it and some nearby spiders
			-You harvested the worm's poison stinger


-4/25/20:
	-We proceeded deeper into the cave, leaving the looting and stinger harvesting for later
		-Making use of those spell durations
	-Joe triggered an Alarm trap, waking a shambling mound infected by some violet fungus
		-We pasted it, though Joe needed some substantial healing
	-Beyond it lay a ruined and moldy temple to Deep Duerra
		-Queen of the Invisible Arts and the Axe-Princess of Conquest, the Druegar goddess of
		 psionics
			-Makes sense there'd be a temple to her near the psionic cave
		-In the center of it lay a stone chair, upon which an inscription appeared as we entered,
		 saying "I know you're here." in Undercommon.
			-The chair is meant to symbolize that she is always watching and listening.
			-Saphire dragons are known for hiding their lairs using Shape Stone.
				-There is a secret door beneath the chair.
		-There are also some chambers for the long gone clerics, looted long ago
	-We opened dispelled the psionic lock on the secret door and opened it
		-There was a cavern with the sounds of mining below, with no means of descent but the
		 sounds of mining coming form the cavern floor 30' below
		-My constructs leapt down and I flew in, only to be greeted by two Destrachans and a
		 mining duergar 
		-A round into the ensuing battle, the saphire dragon skittered in along the ceiling and
		 sealed the entrance, stranding all but me on the other side
		-Adalia dimension doored in all but our warforged, only for most of them to be panicked
		 by some power of the dragon's, running off
		-Ned hacked his way through the stone above, though, allowing Renar to deal tons of acid
		 damage to it while a new flying construct dragged (via trip) it down in reach of the
		 existing ones, who finally slew it.
		-It's thralls all seem to have run off during the fight

-Do loot and XP in chat
	-We got some stuff, but need to do a thorough search
	-Jake posted it and you updated the sheet
-Also, you need to investigate that psionic cavern
	-Probably need to hear some details about it's general physical description from Jake
	-Potentially useful powers you have access to:
		-Correspond
			-Would let me talk to "One creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher"
			-Notably, that doesn't require that it have a language
			-It doesn't work with stuff immune to mind affecting (most of these have the same limit)
				-Somewhat unlikely the cave both has a mind and is immune to mind affecting
		-Tongues, Psionic
			-If it _can_ vocalize, this would help us understand, should it speak an odd language
		-Sense Link
			-Not _obviously_ useful, but lets you share one sense of "One willing creature"
		-Divination
			-Magic Google can help lots of things, though it's not clear right now what questions
			 we might have
		-Detect Remote Viewing
			-Is it watching us psionically? Is something else?
				-That writing on the stone chair was the dragon, right?
	-You need crystals from the cave for power stones
		-The fact that the dragon's thralls seemed to have been mining the crystals suggests the
		 cave either doesn't mind or can't stop us from getting them
			-Still, you'd rather be friendly about this. The cave, if it is in some sense aware,
			 seems likely to possess two traits that interest you, psionics and a long life.
		-Did Jake say they were _Deep Crystal_?
			-If so, you are interested in all of it you can get your hands on. You can craft great
			 psionic weapons from it, and all sorts of other stuff. For other stuff, it's just
			 expensive "metal" (equivalent HP/hardness to iron/steel), but really thematic for you.
-And find both power stone components and whatever the elans requested!
-Skin that dragon?
	-https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialMaterials.htm
-Pickup that concentration crystal
-Get more power stones
	-See TODO
	-Order remaining stones for powers you'll be replacing, once you have those cave crystals
		-Total cost 2775, for Major Creation and Fabricate, Greater
-Sell your sonic protection stuff
-Come back to that beholder
	-Maybe after reforming into ego whip? And/or poisons to disable?


-4/30/20:
	-We successfully skinned the dragon and collected the crystal the elans wanted
		-Also, a bunch of deep crystal and some valuable mushrooms
	-We then teleported back to the capital, delivering the crystal from the dragon to the elans
		-Apparently we need to deliver it to some floating island, above an archipelago, and begin
		 the stabilization process
		-We will have to defend it during this process as, during the process, many in the
		 know across the planes will detect it
			-We've already encountered the minions of Pandorym
			-We should also expect opposition from chaotic outsiders, particularly demons
				-We might expect a Retriever, some spider-like Abyssal construct known for eye rays
		-The island is some 300 miles towards The Old World
			-There, a shattered island makes up the archipelago with a floating temple above it
			-The elans hid the temple, and gave us an enchanted spyglass that will reveal it
	-With a plan in mind, Ada teleported our warforged back to Xûl-Jarak (they, and Renar in real
	 life, having some urgent business for a bit) and the rest of us to Melvaunt for some shopping
	-We stayed at our usual inn, and bought a drink for the dwarf that referred us to his cousin
	-Qebras contacted us when he somehow detected us teleporting into town, requesting to speak with
	 Dog
		-He met us at the inn
		-He had found information about betailed orcs
		-He said there were Simic bio-wizards there, and orcs with tails had been seen leaving
		 their lab
			-Qebras knows the location, and said he'd provide it to Dog on request
			-We said we'd talk to him after stabilizing the planes
	-We rested, and woke up the next day, 5 days away from the election
	-Joe rolled amazingly on gather information and found us an elven wingship going our way for
	 50 gp. a head, leaving the next day
	-I picked up my concentration crystal
	-Commissioned the Major Creation and Fabricate, Greater power stones I wanted, paying the 2775
	 up front in Melvaunt. It'll be done within 3 days.
	-We then rested again and set sail the next morning
		-It was smooth sailing and we reached the broken island 3 days later
			-Did 3 days worth of downtime Quintessence
		-I then dimension doored us up to the temple
	-A psionics knowledge check revealed it to be a temple to Xenlaya, a neutral god of balance
	 and transportation, associated with psionics and the planes
		-The temple is a bit worse for the wear, as the balance of the planes is certainly out of
		 whack
		-The temple is comprised of floating ruins, linked by green fields of force, emananting from
		 nearby crystals, forming bridges between the islands
			-Jake mentioned that, if the crystals are broken, it may remove the force fields
	-We now have between sessions to prepare for the attack that will come as soon as we socket the
	 crystal into the alter
		-Jake said it's likely to come near immediately, when I was questioning Ada about whether II
		 should summon constructs in advance or not. Sounds like I should.

-Stuff to prepare:
	-Obviously do Minor Creation fortifications
		-You already summoned many gallons of black lotus extract, and dosed Joe's blades and all
		 his arrows
		-Walls? Arrow hoardings?
		-Maybe Major instead, for metals and such?
			-Can still manage an hour per level for stuff like iron
	-Disable any force fields?
	-Powers:
		-Some constructs
		-Vigor and Share Pain with crystal
		-Energy adaptation?
		-Timehop traps?
		-Forced Dream?
		-Divination?
			-What to ask?
				-How should we prepare to defend the crystal?
				-Who will come for the crystal?
		-Adalia:
			-Vigor
			-Precognition, Offensive
				-Edric too?
			-Share Pain, via Edric's crystal?
				-Would Dog volunteer? Is it safe for Edric?
	-Finally casting:
		-Edric:
			-Fort: 40
				-Fabricate, Greater x2: 22
					-Walls of temple-stone 9" thick and 8' high
						-120/(9/12)/8=20' of wall, for each casting
					-8 arrow slits, one on each 5' side

-4/30/20: Battle at the Floating Temple
	-We powered up, socketed the crystal into the alter, and the battle began.
	-A portal opened immediately, spilling forth half-fiend orcs.
	-Tentacles also spilled out of a portal that opened against the wall of my fabricated fort,
	 grappling Liliana, though we quickly Dimension Swapped her and Dog.
	-The demonic Retriever eventually joined the fray as well.
	-Fortunately, everything proved vulnerable to the liberal application of bludgeoning and, after
	 a hard fought battle, we prevailed.

-Do XP and loot in Discord between sessions
	-3500 xp, but no loot as of yet.
		-Loot is done too.
-Figure out if Ada can teleport back or needs rest
	-Either way, no big deal.
	-Yeah, she can manage four more castings, which should cover it.
		-She will need two trips, though, as she can only take 3 other people.
-Ada needs to level up too
	-Done
-Pick up your additional, high level power stones
	-You already paid
-After that, reform and then level up to 13
-Come back to that beholder
	-Ego whip? And/or poisons to disable?
		-Ego whip, especially if Ada joins in, is absurdly good.
-Buy/make some needles or the like, to go with Telekinetic Thrust and poison?
	-Done


-6/6/20:
	-We teleported back to Xûl-Jarak, to drop off our pile of smelted Retriever steel and spent the
	 night.
		-Before bed, Liliana and I poured over the Tome of Worldly Knowledge, and determined that
		 Beholders are moderately, but not extremely charismatic.
		-I also helped Dog Reform into Leadership.
		-Finally, I crafted my jug of darksteel needles.
			-I'm modeling the jug on my metal growler.
				-I made it from steel, and it similarly has a locking, water-tight lid.
				-The notion is to be able to dump poison in there and seal it.
			-The needles do 1 piercing and 1 electicity damage, the latter due to the darksteel.
			-Have not yet established how many of these things I can use with a single casting, and
			 otherwise how generally broken this is.
				-Ah! From the spell description: "You can hurl one object or creature per manifester
				 level (maximum fifteen separate targets)"
				-Using roughing nails as a general guide to count: "Approximately 140 of these
				 nails make a pound"
	-We then teleported to the capitol, reporting our success to the elder Elans.
		-They confirmed this was merely a delaying action, stabilizing planes, but the Pandorym
		 cultists will surely try again. That delay, though, could easily have bought us years.
		-They are reasearching a Seal of Binding, to solve the problem permanently.
			-Knowledge(The Planes) suggested it was work of Epic psionics, to banish a powerful
			 being from the planes entirely.
			-They will let us know when we're needed again.
		-Haravak informed us that lands to the East of the fortress are calm, but that undead are
		 stirring in the West.
			-Similar markings suggest a shared origin. We'd previously heard rumors of a lich in
			 the West.
	-Finally, we returned to Melvaunt, as the date House Nather asked us to be available for the
	 election is a day away.
		-Too little time to hunt the beholder, sadly.
			-Adalia did say she'd be willing to help us in that, when time allows.
		-We sold our loot, handed Adalia her share, and took care of some personal business about
		 town.
			-I picked up my Power Stone order.
			-Conor met up with his gnomish cohort, a bard, who promptly took Conor to get some
			 better clothes for the party tomorrow, for the election.
				-His name is Namfoodle "Beansinger" Nackle
		-We then met with Lord Nather.
			-He claimed that his election to despot is all but assured, and invited us to the
			 celebration tomorrow.
			-He also suggested that he intends to, upon his election, announce an initiative to
			 settle the wild lands of Thar and lay claim to The Ride.
				-Obviously that's to our interest.
				-He had already used his influence to end the conflict Melvaunt had been involved
				 in a short while earlier.
				-He said he intends to quarter troops for the effort at Xûl-Jarak, and would pay
				 us for doing so.
				-However, he first wants this demon problem settled.
					-We let him know we've got a plan.
		-I then performed my Reformation and we went in search of a party.
			-As Namfoodle led us to a bar, he talked of the history of Melvaunt. Interestingly, he
			 mentioned that the city's founding was driven by the export of iron ore from the
			 surrounding area. Melvaunt became the point it was smelted and shipped out by sea.
			-At the gnomish whiskey bar, Joe recruited informants and Namfoodle entered a violin
			 contest.
				-Namfoodle ended up winning, getting some gold and a headlining gig for the nobles'
				 party we're going to tomorrow anyways.
	-The next day, we went to the party.
		-Lord Nather indeed won, announcing his plans to tame the frontier and turn Melvaunt into
		 a regional power.
		-We left off at the end of his speech.


-6/10/20:
	-We're still at the party.
	-Houses Leiyraghon and Bruil are conspicuously absent.
		-Leiyraghon previously held the despot's seat, and were the ones with the treacherous heir
		 consorting with orcs, while Bruil are the shipping magnates.
		-The two have a somewhat tenuous alliance (strained by that whole kidnapping affair).
	-Joe overheard the guard captain talking to the newly named despot about someone smuggling in
	 some kind of poison or the like into the city. Fearing basically a chemical weapons attack on
	 the city, the captain was requesting additional resources to investigate.
		-He believes the smugglers are operating in small coves along the coast.
		-He also mentioned the people are somewhat war weary, but still enthused for Lord Nather's
		 ambtions (so long as we keep winning).
		-His name is Captain Halevard.
	-Someone from House Marsk was also elected magistrate of the market district.
		-Joe had previously helped them out, sabotaging a Bruil potion lab in some solo adventure,
		 helping them corner the market and win this seat.
		-He's already looking to the Winter Festival, a big event for the market district.
			-This election party also serves as the year's harvest festival.
	-We also heard rumors of a planned redistricting of The Stomping Grounds, the hangout of Dog's
	 barbarian buddies.
		-Sounds like it might be getting gentrified.
		-Doesn't sound _too_ likely to happen either.
	-We also heard rumors of increased activities at the docks, and more piracy as well.
		-Could be tied to the smuggling mentioned above.
		-We also heard mention of "Chaositech", the dark works that our brain jar is part of.
			-Sounds like similar stuff is being moved through the city.
	-As the party wound down, we headed back to our usual Inn, The Crow's Nest.
		-We caught the night shift, with the bar being tended by a half elf.
			-His name is Ianelor.
				-I mentioned to the rest of my party the ambition to eventually build inns along future
				 roads, and that I'm looking to build a relationship with potential future renters.
					-Ianelor does sound like a good candidate.
			-The owner usually works the day shift.
			-He said the military activity lately has been great for business.
			-I, responding, mentioned that we've been hearing there's been _lots_ of extra activity
			 at the docks lately.
				-In response to that all, using some rogue-y hand signals and the like, he pointed
				 over to a rough looking crowd around one of the tables, who seem to be smugglers.
					-Sounds like he's got some underground connections, and did us a bit of a solid
					 here.
					-Eavesdropping on them a bit a bit, Beansinger heard mention of a captain known
					 as Salty Pinkerton, captain of The Dauntless, operating out of a nearby cove.
						-Seems he'll be smuggling things out of the city within the next month.
						-Makes sense (after a Profession(Sailor) check, as shipping in Melvaunt
						 slows heavily a month from now, due to Winter. Icebreakers or the like
						 become necessary.
						-Leliana cast Charm Person on one of them, stealthily, after he peeled off
						 from the group for a bit.
						-Pumping him for information, she got him to offer "feydust".
							-Seems to be some kind of drug.
								-"It'll make you real smart and real quick. It'll help you focus."
						-Pushing him further, Leliana followed him back to his room.
							-"Well, I don't have any on me. . ."
							-Joe followed them in, interrogating the sailor at knifepoint, asking
							 what poison people are moving through the city.
						-The poison is called "deluge", and apparently spreads easily in
						 a water supply or can be easily vaporized.
						-Mentioned that, among the nobles, Leiyraghon and Bruil seem to be
						 buying.
							-They don't want this new war, and seek to sabotage it.
							-He mentioned Captain Chatam, known as "The Snake", in connection
							 with this.
						-Joe then intimidated the sailor again, suggesting he not tell anyone about
						 this. Didn't go very well, though, and he gathered his buddies and headed
						 out.
	-We followed the sailors back to their ship, with the help of Liliana's owl familiar.
		-We rendered them quite thoroughly dead.
		-On the ship, we found several vials of both their feydust and the rumored deluge.
		-We reported the find back to the captain of the guard, also giving them Captain Chatam's
		 name and mentioning that the sailor reported buyers from Houses Leiyraghon and Bruil for
		 the Deluge.
		-The sailors had flintlock pistols, so apparently that's a thing.
			-https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Flintlock_Pistol_(3.5e_Equipment)
			-You even had protracted downtime to study them, before selling them.
	-After that, we headed back to The Crow's Nest.
		-There, I Corresponded with Adalia, letting her know we're ready to tackle that beholder,
		 and to meet us at The Crow's Nest.
			-Dealing with demons is probably a higher priority, but Joe quite reasonably wants to
			 wait on the armor Renar is crafting for him, before visiting The Abyss.
	-Spent remaining power points on Quintessence before sleeping.


-Questions for Jake:
	-Details of what Feydust and Deluge are (possibly having us roll some Knowledge checks)?
		-https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/720477582176419883
		-Did the guards take them, as they did with the ship?
			-https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/720734101514223668
	-Value for those and the bullets+gunpowder?
		-Same as first link: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/720477582176419883
-Questions about the Beholder plan:
	-Is there a Cha targetting poison?
		-Ungol Dust, but it's inhaled, low DC, and not clearly made from plants
	-What about Wis poisons? They'd hurt it's will save.
		-Bloodroot is the only injury one, has a 12 DC, no initial damage, and also does more Con
		 than Wis, secondary.
		-There's a genuinely good inhaled one, and an ingested one, but the inhaled one isn't clearly
		 plant-based.
	-Maybe Conor's best role is grappling?
		-At minimum, it's a 20 + spell level Concentration check to cast, and that applies to spell-like
		 abilities. If it's an _actual_ spell, grapple will prevent anything with somatic requirements,
		 but spell-like abilities don't have that, and are likely what the beholder has.
			-Still better than the 15 + spell level Concentration check to cast defensively
	-Nonlethal is also an option. -4 attack roll penalty to do it with normal melee weapon.


-6/17/20:
	-We had Aadalia teleport us back to that beholder cave
		-First, we had Joe pick up a sap.
	-There, we explored the tunnels, finding some petrified humanoids in the first chamber.
		-They're all missing vital bits, and would likely die if reverse-fossilized.
	-The second cave had a number of drider, hiding behind an easily dispelled illusion.
		-Illusion was of a medusa. So, what's the deal with the statues up front?
	-Then dealt with some annoying, but immobile fungus.
	-We ended the game in combat with the beholder, amidst said fungus.
		-With Liliana's lantern archon, we should finally get sight of this thing, and I then
		 pretty much just Ego Whip it.
			-Find that Devo song?
		-Also, you have that invisible construct about, though you can't currently see it on the
		 map. Make sure to use that.
		-No XP was awarded, nor searching of anywhere done (for the sake of my durations). Deal with
		 all of that after next session.


-6/24/20: Beholder Battle!
	-Ego whip is proving decidedly effective
	-Yep, whipped it into catatonia.
	-The shaft it was hiding in led to it's larder, a series of cylindrical shafts covered by heavy
	 metal plates.
		-They were full of gore and loot.
	-The shaft itself was completely smooth, hard to climb.
		-Joe and Conor both went tumbling down it.
	-Qebras said he'd be there in 20 to pick it up.
	-We then engaged in a comical problem solving exercise, tying a rope to the catatonic beholder,
	 having Conor haul it back up the shaft, and then dragging it around it's lair while we stole 
	 anything of value.
	-Eventually Qebras arrived, taking the beholder and giving us our bounty.
	-While at his tower, we delivered the Quintessence to him and he got started making our fake
	 artifact, containing the trapped warp marble.
	-He can get us within 10 miles of our coordinates, the location of Balaros, in The Abyss.
	-We need to come up with a story for why we're giving them this artifact.
		-"Surrender" it to him?
		-Sell it to him?
			-Beansinger's bardic knowledge check identified a known interplanar arms merchant,
			 Varachus.
				-He's associated with The City of Brass.
				-Described as "giant", "scaled" and "horned".


-Next session will start with us teleporting to The Abyss.
-In between, we should figure out any prep we want to do, including the exact plan for delivering
 the artifact.
-Stuff to prep:
	-A way to safely rest?
	-The plan
		-More info about Varachus?
			-Divination
				-Asked his species here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/727650444394102794
		-The detonation?
			-From old notes on the plan:
				-With the marble, Qebras can overload it, but then we'll need to provide an antimagic field to stabilize it
					-With one of us casting the field, we can then release it when we want the device to explode
			-The Quintessence doesn't solve that in the same way.
			-Maybe some deception, like "Scrape away seal to arm"?
	-Power points spent on this thus far: 7
		-May affect the timing of your expedition, and definitely affects how much Quintessence you can make
-Do Quintessence or other stuff with downtime PP
	-Spent the excess from day of beholder battle.
-Got my power stone wish list: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/725559279074934857

-7/1/20:
	-Before leaving for the Abyss, we paid our staff.
	-We also did some shopping.
	-Finally, I had Renar turn me into a Grell this time, and we had Qebras send us to The Abyss.
	-Upon arrival, we spotted a fortress off on the horizon.
		-Conveniently, our map/coordinates to our target, upon arriving, reacted to the nature of, 
		 the plane, animated, and pointed the way.
	-It being The Abyss, we were also quickly stalked by horrible rat-monkey-wolves, Vores.
		-They were easily scattered.
	-We then encountered a fiery ravine, patroled from the air, but we were able to evade the
	 patrol and briefly summoned a bridge to cross it.
	-We then snuck across the landscape avoiding demonic patrols and camps, heading towards the
	 towering fortress.
	-We quite literally setup shop outside the fortress, constructing tents and signs with
	 Minor Creation while Beansinger attempted bongo heavy death metal.
		-Eventually, we attracted a curious demon, who we tried to get to lead Balaros there.
		-He seemed to generally buy it, but claimed Balaros never leaves the iron fortress.
		-He did agree to lead us to Balaros, which is where we left off.


-7/5/20:
	-They led us into the busy fortress, taking us up to the 6th floor.
		-There, we noticed even more commotion, some kind of chanting.
	-There, we met Balaros (I hope! I don't think we actually confirmed it. . .).
		-He didn't buy it, in part because he could see I was polymorphed after casting True
		 Seeing to examine the artifact.
		-Instead, as we were escorted from the room, Joe stashed the "artifact" behind a brazier
		 while I summoned an invisible construct.
		-After being escorted out of the fort, we claimed we left the artifact behind.
		-The demons were predictably not sympathetic.
		-We detonated the artifact then.
		-Not sure if they realized what was up, but demons were certainly swarming out of the
		 suddenly collapsed section of the fort, so we got the hell out of there, via Plane Shift.
	-It dumped us in the sea, 400 miles West of the coast of the continent we're familiar with,
	 "The New World".
		-Roughly halfway between it and The Old World.
		-Revealed by Know Direction and Location.
		-A Profession(Sailor) check revealed we're also ~20 miles North of The Great Vortex,
		 part of the quickest route between the continent, but an area controlled by a wave shaping
		 Merfolk city that charges tolls for the passage.
		-They're known to be generally lawful an peaceable, so we could likely deal with them.
	-Seemed like we had decent, if not quick, options to get home, but sharks were soon swarming us.
		-With all the party save flying grell me and the beansinger I saved from drowning, we opted
		 to plane shift to The Astral Plane and back to The Material, trying again.
	-This time, we ended up in the kingdom Naven, a short distance from it's Northern border with
	 Krakya, the kingdom where Melvaunt is located.
		-We were also close-ish to Joe's homeland, to the West, and, crucially, 20 miles from
		 Steelhammer.
		-We let Qebras know, via the quill, and headed for Steelhammer, asking if he'd like to meet
		 us there.
	-We indeed met Qebras in a tavern in Steelhammer, letting him know the demons were not impressed
	 by the artifact, but that we did indeed manage to detonate it in Balaro's throne room.
		-We expressed interest in confirming his demise, and Qebras volunteered his truenamed demon
		 again.
			-We opted to wait for some downtime interrogation by Ned, since he has far and away the best
			 intimidate.
		-Qebras also kindly helped us teleport back to Melvaunt.


-7/15/20:
	-Now in Melvaunt, we went to go visit Lord Nather.
		-Things are looking even more opulent, now that he's the despot.
		-We reported our strike at Balaros, though warned that we were still awaiting confirmation
		 of the kill from our sources on the lower planes.
		-We also raised the issue of potentially constructing roads and other things in Thar.
			-He directed us to the city engineers, who we should confer with.
		-Finally, we brought up the deluge, offering our aid, and were referred to House Nather's
		 spymaster, so we headed there first.
			-We delivered one vial of the deluge to the spymaster, who called the court wizard to
			 examine it.
			-Through spellwork, he revealed the maker's inadvertant (magical) mark:
				https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/733131944727937115
			-They suggested investigating the symbol, to find where the poison was manufactured.
			-He then directed us to Sigwald, a dwarf working with the city's engineers.
	-We did a handwaved introduction of ourselves to Sigwald.
		-Mostly, we can now confer with him, if we want do do some downtime projects on this front.
		-He _did_ mention he's short on labor, so sounds like they've got a problem we can solve.
	-We then set about investigating that symbol and the maker's of deluge.
		-Through a source Joe has in House Leiyraghon, the head cook, plus Beansinger's bardic
		 knowledge, we got word of a guild of dark wizards.
			-In Thar 30 miles SW of Glister
			-They have a system of tunnels, allowing them covert access to many places.
				-Including, it's rumored, The River Stojanow, giving them shipping access.
				-The tunnels supposedly connect to The Underdark
			-We heard of a landmark, concentric circles of stone. People have been seen entering
			 these circles and disappearing. It is not known where they go or how, but it is
			 believed that this is somehow associated with those wizards.
				-These are on the surface.
			-They're known as The Order of the Blue Skull.
				-They believe the deity they serve made their founder's skull blue, after his death,
				 creating an artifact of evil power, filled with hatred and a maniacal intelligence.
	-We set out immediately, on tireless astral steeds.
		-They can _constantly_ run: http://therafimrpg.wikidot.com/nonabilities
		-With that, we worked out that they move about 18 mph, if they can constantly run.
			-They can even see in the dark!
		-That made for only 11 hours and a bit to cover the 200 miles to the area near Glister.
		-Arriving in the area near one in the morning, we made camp, and then began the search in
		 the morning.
	-Conor's tracking skills quickly found the circle we were looking for.
		-Unfortunately, his impetuousness, throwing a rock into the circle shortly after we
		 arrived, caused two dire wraiths and several smaller ones to appear.
		-They're nasty as fuck, dealing 6 or 7 Con _drain_ per hit.
			-The first to Conor, the second to me.
		-Further, they rolled way better initiative than us.
		-As such, I briefly Accelerated, summoned two artillery constructs, and then Dimension
		 Doored the party up onto a ridge, 770 ft. away, leaving the constructs to beat on these
		 things.
		-The wraiths, though, were clever enough to come after us, with the constructs chasing
		 behind them as I summoned more from the ridge while the party took pot shots and buffed.
		-It took quite a lot of spell power, but we defeated the wraiths.
	-After the battle, wounded but covered by the constructs a while longer, we went to investigate
	 the circle of stone.
		-Several of the stones have strong aura's of abjuration, and those have moveable bits on
		 them, perhaps some kind of activation mechanism.
		-We identified marks on the moveable bits, that we formed into the groups crucible symbol,
		 revealing a spiral staircase down.
	-That's where we paused.
		-There are 5 minutes or so left on the durations of the constructs
		-We need to decide if we continue in our weakened state or retreat for rest (and Restoration?).


-7/22/20:
	-We decided to proceed forward, invading the mage/drug lab
	-First door we knocked down, we found a lab staffed by four alchemists and supervised by a
	 glowing-blue-skull skeleton and a clay golem.
		-I had to burn most of the rest of my psionic juice, but quickly got two more constructs
		 and some temp HP.
		-After that, we finished the spell casters in only a few rounds, though the skeleton briefly
		 escaped behind a door guarded by two animated suits of armor.
	-Upon the skeleton's destruction, it's body disappeared but the still-blue skull remained.
		-Seems like something we should investigate.
	-The door he hid behind also led to some kind of portal, or place for making portals.
		-Will of course also need investigating, which Jake said we'll deal with later, due to ending
		 at 11:00 and all.
	-Still need to do both loot and XP.
		-Lots of loot was a_looted_ to, lol.
		-Now done
			-Normal shops won't by the Chaositech stuff, though


-8/7/20:
	-After searching and looting, we examined that portal
		-It's pointing to the astral plane
		-We failed spellcraft checks to learn much more, but there does appear to be some separate
		 spell forming a barrier over the portal
			-Knowledge(The Planes) suggests it's a barrier preventing *living* things from passing
	-We also found a ledger, though the text appears to be enciphered
	-We then left to go sleep in the woods
		-We were afraid of wraiths walking in through the walls
		-On the way out, I psionically locked the door leading to the portal room and the front
		 door, the mechanism that opened to reveal the stairs down into the lab
	-We managed to stay hidden in a cave, and then headed back to Melvaunt
	-It is now 11/7 in game
	-Once back, we headed to House Nather, meeting with the spymaster
		-They had done some work of their own, exposing rats to Deluge, causing them to become
		 "plagueborn", some kind of vile, zombie-like state
		-We let him know we'd destroyed the lab and turned over the encrypted ledger to the
		 spymaster
		-He recognized the cipher, and found the ledger was divided by *plane* and that one "ship"
		 seems to be located in The Astral Plane
			-The ship scarequotes being because "ship" is a loose term on The Astral Plane, applied
			 to far more unusual vessels than you'd find on The Material Plane
				-The ship also gets referred to as "the cube"
			-That makes stopping this all somewhat tougher.
	-We then went in search of cleric
		-With some reluctance, we accepted Joe's recommendation, and he led us to a temple to
		 Olidammara
		-Conor and I paid 1500 apiece to heal the drain
		-I also magiced up some booze, while waiting on the cleric (was on a booze run), and we
		 drank a bunch
		-Joe seemed to be working on recruiting some followers.
	-We then went to the library, to research pirates
		-Beansinger's bardic knowledge didn't really go anywhere.
		-With Planes and Psionics, something about that cubic ship rang a bell
			-I'd heard of psionic propulsion systems, used on The Astral Plane, a focus crystal
			 powered by several minds.
			-Jake also mentioned that there are other groups of Elans out there, other councils, like
			 the Elan Eternals I know, some with more nefarious ends. I suspect the cube is powered
			 by such works.
				-This might offer another avenue of investigation, asking my fellow Elans, back in
				 the capitol.
	-After that, we hit the streets, trying to track down the two captains we'd heard of in
	 connection with the Deluge smuggling, Salty Pinkerton and The Snake
		-We got word that Pinkerton's lieutenant frequents and inn in town
			-He's a dragonborn and hangs out at The Rusty Hook
	-With that lead to go on, we sold our loot, disguised ourselves, and headed to The Rusty Hook
		-There was indeed a dragonborn there, surrounded by friends.
		-They were playing some sort of game of chance.
		-Beansinger walked right up and claimed to have been sent by Salty Pinkerton (backed, at
		 least by Glibness).
			-Bullshitted his way through some check on operation status.
			-Afterwards, he joined their game, and later Joe too.
			-Conor tried to ingratiate himself with the dragonborn, messaging info about Joe's
			 cards wtih magic.
			-Joe caught him, though, and accused them of cheating.
	-That looks to be escalating into a fight, which is where we left off.


-Update quarrying records, now that it's 11/7
	-Nothing of interest was found in the collapsed room
	-Did value of stone, but do volume cleared! #34 should be clear, but need to find out what that
	 looks like, and can calculate how much #37 has been expanded
		-Volume done too now, though it was hardly anything.


-8/13/20:
	-Yep, straight to the fight, as started last session.
	-I asked Joe and Beansinger to yell, "Dout dask jahus vi zi cheap prostitute svabolen kikremic
	 kii wux re mishun vin nurh vorqir petisse," should they need my help.
		-Translated online, save a couple of words, from, "Your mother was a very cheap prostitute
		 which explains why you are such an ugly looking kobold."
		-Used this: http://draconic.twilightrealm.com/
		-Joe yelled it out immediately, things being somewhat more pear shaped than I had hoped.
	-No small thanks to my first trial run of whirlwind constructs, we pulped them, save their
	 leader, the dragonborn, who we spared (but Dominated).
	-The guards, though, showed up, and were a bit concerned about all the corpses.
		-The party let them know we'd go quietly, and that we had news they'd want to hear, so they
		 escorted us and the dragonborn to the guard captain.
		-Well, all save me. All anyone could _see_ me do, throughout the fight, was sit there and
		 drink my beer. Even my constructs were invisible.
			-I asked Joe to palm my psicrystal on the way out, so I could talk with them, and then
			 pretended to be a gawker, following the guards and party leaving the massacre.
	-The guard captain immediately recognized the party, and asked what the deal was.
		-We explained we'd caught a lieutenant of Salty Pinkerton, and that Lord Nather would be
		 very interested in what he had to say.
	-They turned him over to us in an interrogation room, and we proceeded to magically
	 interrogate the dragonborn.
		-He confirmed they were in the employ of House Leiyraghon.
			-They wish to cause chaos and dissatisfaction with the current leadership.
			-They tried to drag House Bruil into it, but seem to have been rebuffed.
			-The pirates deal with one of the house's spies, a human, alias "Bleak Lotus".
				-He has some secret coin, used as a symbol of recognition, with a maple leaf symbol on
				 one side of it.
				-They meet with the spy about once every 10 days (promising, given the duration of
				 Dominate), with the next one being in 4 days.
					-They get the location from a dead drop, such that we'll have about a day to
					 plan after we find out where it is.
						-A few members of the crew go to pick it up.
						-The note will be encyphered, describing the location of the meeting and the
						 amount to deliver, and he gave us a cylinder revealing the cipher.
					-Usually, he's come in aboard his boat, meeting them by some docks.
			-We contacted House Nather, via the quill, asking them what sort of proof they'd need,
			 to firmly pin this on House Leiyraghon.
				-They suggested capturing the spy should suffice, who could then be brought before
				 a court and place in a Zone of Truth.
		-He also gave us some details of the smuggling operation.
			-He talked about their dead drops and the pickup schedule for them.
			-He also gave us the name of 8 customs officials they were bribing, to hide it.
				-Some on each shift.
	-The plan:
		-We beat the pirates to the dead drop, maybe even staking it out well before anything is
		 supposed to be there.
		-We replace it with a forged note, sending them elsewhere.
			-Beansinger got an impressive Knowledge(Local) roll, suggesting a plausible cove for a
			 fake pirate meeting spot.
			-Joe got a 24 when forging the note.
		-We then go to the real meeting instead, and bag us a spy.
	-We have 4 days until the dead drop.
		-We headed back to Xûl-Jarak at the end of our session, so it will be 3 days until the drop,
		 when we wake up in the morning there.
		-Our plan is to use the time at the fort to explore our door to The Underdark, and track
		 down where the orcs were mining that iron ore.


-Figure out what Fabrication you can do the night you get back to the fort.
	-110 PP to spend.
	-We need to decide the DC for Superior Masonry Walls.
		-Jake gave it a DC of 30, which can be automatic with Renar's help.
	-We need to figure out what volume I have to transform.
		-fortress_modifications.txt already has a stone volume-to-price ratio established, and Jake
		 already priced the repair at 25k gp. here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/585612732993372173
			-That has (density of stone in lbs./ft.^3)/(1 gp. worth of stone in lbs.)=168.6/3.87=43.56 gp./ft.^3
			-25000/(168.6/3.87)=573.84 ft.^3 of stone needed.
		-Made my proposal here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/743685434462175314
			-Also mentioned adding the basement drain grate.
			-If that all is accepted, subtract the materials from your stores of stone and steel.
				-Yep, it's approved and the materials have been subtracted.


-8/27/20:
	-The morning after arriving at Xûl-Jarak, we ventured forth into The Underdark.
		-There were fairly clear signs which way the iron was coming from, in that there are mine
		 cart rails.
		-However, in spots, they've been rent and torn.
			-With some additional Survival rolls, we confirmed that several something have been
			 digging tunnels through the area.
		-Sure enough, a pair of purple worms burst from the tunnel walls and attacked us.
			-One of the bastards swallowed me whole!
			-I dimension doored out of it's gullet, temporally accelerated, and summoned some
			 constructs that pulped it.
			-Only for another to go and do the same damned thing!
			-Fed up, this time I dimension doored back to the damn fortress basement, since we
			 never got very far.
				-Tired of these bile baths, and as close to death as Edric has been in a long while,
				 he was pretty fed up with this shit.
			-Fortunately, the construct pulped the remaining 2 worms that very turn.
		-After some healing, we headed deeper into The Underdark, continuing to follow the mine
		 cart tracks.
		-Rounding a corner, arrows flew at us, from a pack of Desmodus behind an arrow blind.
			-A Knowledge check or two, though, revealed these guys are pretty decent for Underdark
			 dwellers, and folks we could deal with.
				-They're bat people.
				-Generally Lawful alignments.
				-As a society, they're divided into 3 castes, Explorers, Merchants, and Warriors.
				-They've also been slowly losing a war against the drow for something like 300 years.
			-They've basically claimed the territory the iron has been coming from.
			-We were able to come to an arrangement.
				-They seemed skeptical, but we were eventually able to talk them into delivering to
				 us 2 tons of iron ore a month, in exchange for half that returned in finished goods.
					-To get it that high, we promised _all_ of the first 2 tons returned to them in
					 finished goods (it's chump change for us, hundreds of gold, and no effort to
					 cast Fabricate a couple of times, but the good will gesture doubled what they
					 were willing to deliver to us.
						-Jake also hinted that it could be improved further, via infrastructure
						 improvements, like repairing the mine cart rails, or other means.
					-They're also willing to purchase additional finished goods, at 75% of list price.
					-We gave them a secret knock (and informed our guards on the way back), so that
					 they can make deliveries to our basement door, and asked them to deliver the iron
					 as soon as they could, with a list of what they wanted.
				-Jake previously established the grade of iron ore found in the fortress at 70%
				 iron by mass, and this seems to be the same.
				-Iron ingots are listed as 1 sp. per lb. in the Player's Handbook
				-With this all, we can work out an income per month (that assumes they buy all of
				 the resulting finished goods, a good deal for them and us, given that they're now
				 our trade partners and are at war):
					(2000*.7*.1*3)/2*.75 = 157.5 gp. received each month


-9/7/20:
	-The morning after our Underdark trade meeting, we headed back to Melvaunt.
	-Upon arrival, that night, we went to scope out the dead drop location.
	-Joe spotted the maple leaf mark we were told about, and found a secret door into the warehouse
	 we were told the dead drop would be at.
	-Peering into a window, Joe spotted some kind of "drones" inside, some kind of construct, as
	 well as an entrance to the sewers.
	-I took a pass with Detect Psionics, noticing the auras of the constructs, but also one on the
	 secret door _and_ on some kind of chamber beneath the warehouse, distinct from the sewer
	 entrance, though the secret door appears to lead to it.
	-I performed a Divination, getting a confusing omen in the form of a street performer's card
	 trick.
	-We debated, and ultimately opted to have me dispel the auras on the door and chamber.
	-In doing, so, it seemed, we locked our selves out, as the door wouldn't open.
	-Joe correctly interpreted the card trick, though, that we must replace what we remove, and had
	 Liliana cast an abjuration spell on the door, restoring access to whatever portal allowed it's
	 function.
	-He then hid the psicrystal inside, to alert us to whenever the message is dropped off.


-9/10/20:
	-We slept the night, leveled up, and prepped to hear from the crystal.
	-The crystal alerted us when a hand reached in and dropped off a jar with a wax seal.
	-Through the wonders of my newfound Channel Power ability, I was able to Teleport the crystal
	 to us.
	-Joe carefully removed the stamped seal, grabbed the note, and replaced it with our forgery.
		-He had moderate success.
	-We strolled by the building again, and covertly Dimension Doored the crystal and note in, and
	 than the crystal back out again.
	-We also left Liliana's owl, to watch over the dead drop, and to watch for pirates collecting
	 the false note.
	-From there, we took pains to shake any tail we may have picked up, but headed to House Nather
		-There, we decoded the note, and conferred with the spymaster.
		-He agreed to send guards to the false location, to intercept the pirates, and offered some
		 options for getting the evidence we need against House Leiyraghon.
			-He gave us a capture crystal, some kind of expensive magic camera.
			-He also suggested capturing those meeting us there, perhaps sealing them in the cave.
	-The real meeting 2 days
		-In a cave on a nearby island, Wilba.
			-Ferries are available, taking just a couple of hours.
		-The island also features Wilba's Market, a semi-legitimate market that's rife with black
		 market trade.
	-We found a well maintained ferry, leaving in 2.5 hours.
	-Joe also found that a diplomatic mission from his homeland is in town.
		-Apparently he's on bad terms with his father, an elvish noble, and perhaps another noble
		 house.
		-The envoys appear to be from House Moontree, nobles known to Joe.
		-I offered to help Joe with a gift, conjuring some elven wine with Minor Creation.
			-In return, they mentioned the location of the public reception for the visiting
			 nobles, an inn in the noble's quarter of Melvaunt.
			-It's the next night.
	-Wandering the streets, we also heard guards discussing some unrest in The Stomping Grounds.
		-I pointed out to Conor that sounded like an opportunity for him.
		-With some time left before the ferry leaves, we decided to check things out.
		-Overhearing some rumors on the streets there, and following up on them, we learned that
		 a barbarian named Nigaff the Lifestealer, backed by a large clan, is challenging Dog's
		 authority in the area, claiming his blood isn't pure enough to lead.
		-Dog and Beansinger put out the word that Dog would face him at $SOME_LOCATION in 48 hours
	-With that, we were out of time, and got on the ferry.
		-There were a number of other travelers, so I made another batch of magic booze, and
		 encouraged our Gather Information-y-est party members to chat with the other passengers,
		 get a feeling for what's going on with the island.
		-Seems like this is basically a popular, post-harvest-festival shopping destination. Lots of
		 folks are taking the ferry over and doing some shopping.
			-Sounds like a convenient excuse for our presence.
	-Arriving at the island, we did some more Gathering of Information, to get a feel for what's
	 going on, on the island.
		-We heard rumor of a more. . . illicit market run by a half elf named Buxton.
			-Sounds like an opportunity to unload our weird, corrupted items.
				-Another good excuse for why we're on the island too.
			-Apparently he's identifiable by his neck tatoo of a skull, and can lead you to his
			 shop.
			-We went looking for him, with a Knowledge(Local) check.
				-We spotted him at the docks, working as a longshoreman.
			-We made contact, and he led us down into his shop, via a crate disquising stairs down.
				-We showed him our collection of various corrupt ichors.
					-He was indeed interested in buying.
	-With shopping stuff done, we left off just before investigating the cave.


-9/17/20:
	-Joe scouted the cave, with my psicrystal in tow.
		-It was empty aside from some native fauna, some chull crab monsters and some kind of
		 animate fungus mound. Joe simply avoided them.
		-Aside from the entrance we found, it also had a cliffside entrance, opening to the other
		 side of the island, with a winch.
		-I took a stroll over, to look at the cave entrance, and then we headed back to the market.
	-We then found an inn in town, casting some long lasting spells and then resting, to prep for
	 our meeting at daybreak.
	-Joe snuck back into the cave an hour before hand, with my crystal in hand and the owl overhead.
	-Soon enough, a ship arrived at the cliffside entrance, crewed by warforged.
		-They climbed the cliff face, then used the winch to raise there fellows and several barrels.
		-A lone, human looking figure eventually arrived, apparently overseeing things.
		-With that as our cue, I summoned a construct to smash the ship, channeling it through my
		 crystal, and then teleported the rest of the party to the cave entrance.
	-We made short work of the warforged, but the other figure became invisible.
		-We eventually cornered him, though, with the help of the crystal's senses and some purpose
		 built blindsight constructs.
		-The constructs pummeled him with Concussion Blast for a bit, until he surrendered to Joe.
		-We then tried various mind invasions, with Dominate eventually working.
	-Now cooperative, he confirmed he was our target, and we all teleported back to the quarters of
	 House Nather's spymaster.
		-That's where we left off for the night, with Jake giving us our XP (2500) and letting us
		 know the quantity of gold in the barrels (12,580).
		-During downtime, we should do some degree of interrogation, and also make our arguments
		 for why we get to keep all that gold, rather than accepting a mere finders fee.


-9/24/20:
	-Having handed our captive over to House Nather, we went off in search of this Nigaff who had
	 challenged Dog, we having set the date of the duel to basically now.
	-Nigaff leads the Onyx tribe
		-We also saw banners for the Dire Bear, Lost Mountain, and Ghost Forest clans.
	-Finding Nigaff, we proceeded to the duel site.
	-It was hard fought, but Dog eventually shoved him down a nearby well, to his death.
		-Dog did, with the aid of Leliana, fly down the well and retrieve Nigaff's fanciest stuff,
		 including his forever bloody axe, an axe of nine lives stealing.
		-That axe seems pretty cursed, though, forcing the wielder to attack random folks nearby.


-9/30/20:
	-With Conor's victory in the duel, the barbarians immediately started a celebration party.
		-I made some booze, announcing loudly that it's to celebrate Dog's victory.
		-Seems like he has effectively usurped the leadership of the Onyx Tribe.
	-While there, I pulled Joe aside, and asked him about the feasability of making timber trade
	 connections at our next party, with the elven diplomats.
		-With a solid Knowledge(Nobility & Royalty) roll, he knew of House Ellon, allies of his
		 family and in the timber trade.
		-They might be amenable to some sort of trade deal, especially in return for a favor.
			-Joe even knew they had issues with a group of elven separatists, known as the Eldreth
			 Veluuthra.
			-They're genocidal elven racists, causing issues with relations with other nations, and
			 not folks anyone would miss much if they were passed through an astral meat grinder.
	-Joe also did a meet and greet with the shaman who oversaw the duel.
		-He also raised the possibility of moving the tribe to Thar, after the shaman complained
		 they did not thrive in the city.
		-She said she needed to meditate on this, and commune with the gods, concerning this move.
			-She proposed performing a vision quest in seven days time, using some kind of psychedelic
			 mushroom.
				-That would be the 20th of this month.
				-She invited us to join.
					-This will involve some prep work from us.
			-I had a decent Knowledge(Nature) roll, and knew something about the mushroom in question.
				-Apparently it allows for a primitive form of divination.
	-Dog remained at the barbarian party, along with Beansinger, but Joe and I left for the elven
	 diplomats' party.
		-On the way, we did some quick shopping and also grabbed some rooms at our favorite inn, to
		 change.
	-The party was certainly a staid affair, compare to the raucous barbarian celebration.
		-Our hosts being fashionably late, we did some wine tasting.
		-I was able identify something missing among the spread, a certain variety from a river valley
		 near the elven capitol, known for it's mild flavors despite its strength.
			-Vitruvian wine, named for the river Vitrune.
		-Took me a few tries, but I eventually replicated it perfectly, with a natural 20 and total
		 roll of 31.
		-Joe also spotted one Kymil, an old school friend of his, and a member of House Ellon.
			-She had her own rebellious streak, so the two of them got along well.
			-I managed to impress her with the wine.
			-I raised the timber trade.
				-She mentioned her family was looking to expand operations into The Gray Forest, on
				 the border of their kingdom and that in which Melvaunt lies.
				-However, they're being stymied by Eldreth Veluuthra.
			-She was also able to arrange the tour of their ship, which was indeed an elven wingship.
		-Joe also ran into the family lawyer.
			-Seems like there's some bad blood there, having to do with his exile from the Northern
			 elvish kingdom.
		-He also caught up with an old tutor, a warrior and former adventurer.
		-Eventually the guests of honor arrived, the heads of House Moontree.
			-After food, we joined the line of petitioners.
			-The wine indeed made a good impression, and I wedged in a subtle boast about its
			 duration.
		-On the way out, we ran into Orin, the civil engineer managing road projects for Melvaunt.
			-Pretty drunk, he mentioned we should stop by his office tomorrow.
			-Might be a thing to do with downtime, if we take a break for a bit.
		-With that, we did (handwaved) the tour of the ship, collected Dog, and headed to our rooms
		 at the inn.


-10/8/20:
	-As came up during downtime, we got that formal offer from Lord Nather, of title to the lands
	 around the fort.
	-We thus had some questions about local politics.
		-Sounds like the local cities are more or less independent.
		-War tends to be between the uncivilized people and the cities, rather than open war
		 between them, though the cities do regularly vie for land and influence in more indirect
		 ways.
			-Often, that took the form of regular hordes of savage peoples demanding tribute from
			 the cities, once a generation or so. Our presence seems to have disrupted that a bit,
			 though.
		-In the way of current hostilities, the previously mentioned lich is currently menacing
		 Thentia. He makes his home somewhere in Thar South of the Tomb of Kursk, right on the 
		 southern border of our new territory.
		-To our Northwest, there are more barbarian tribes, comprised of various humanoids, but
		 they're currently quiet.
	-We've got various open threads:
		-Waiting to hear from Qebras, to confirm our demon kill.
		-Waiting to hear back from that druid about the proposed vision quest, as part of moving
		 Conor's followers into Thar.
		-Waiting to hear what happened with our prisoner in the Deluge plot, whether House
		-Those warforged in that tower.
		-Racist elven separatists, the thwarting of whom could help us with a timber deal.
		-Joe had gotten word from his contacts about a chaos cult in the area.
	-We opted to follow up a bit on what Joe had heard about some kind of problematic cult activity.
		-He heard about the presence of followers of the Chaotic Evil god Ixtab, from his gnomish
		 party cleric buddy.
		-Apparently Ixtab's followers like to sow chaos amongst other religions, and it seem to be
		 escalating, with murders and arson in the temple district on the rise, accompanied by graffiti
		 associated Ixtab.
		-Joe had also heard that our rival houses, Leiyraghon and Bruil, may be involved in funding
		 these psychos.
		-This presented us with both an opportunity to ingratiate ourselves with House Nather while
		 looking for information, so we headed over to their compound.
			-We asked the spymaster if he had any info we could follow up on.
				-There were indeed some unsolved murders in the temple district, accompanied by
				 disturbing grafitti. Strangely, among stabs and the like, some of the victims showed
				 _wolf_ bites.
				-The most recent murder featuring the bites occurred at the temple of Altana, two nights
				 ago.
					-The goddess of dawn and protector of children.
	-We also signed the agreement with House Nather, accepting our title to the lands around the
	 fortress in Thar.
		-The Brotherhood of Xûl-Jarak are now officially the wardens of Thar.
		-We also negotiated the tax rate. It'll only be 10% for the first year, before it goes
		 up to the 20% discussed here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/763549106559647775
		-Apparently we need to come up with a crest.
	-From there, we went to the morgue, in search of one of our wolf-bit murder victims.
		-Conor identified the bite as a _were_wolf bite.
		-Though D&D werewolves can transform anytime, they have to actively resist it during a full
		 moon, and the murder _did_ occur during a full moon.
			-Clerics and belladonna can cure lycanthropy, but it must be done within 3 days of
			 infection.
	-We then headed to the (visibly damaged) temple district.
		-Different temples are visibly scarred by flames, and the temple of Altana still showed
		 bits of the scrubbed away grafitti.
		-Greeted by an acolyte at the temple, we learned the name of our victim, Brother Kusha.
		-We met with the leader of the temple, one Mieiel.
			-She provided a copy of the grafitti symbol, an emblem comprised of a serpent and
			 sickle.
		-Apparently the actual symbol was also magical, accounting for the difficult in removing
		 it.
			-Beansinger dispelled it, revealing a bit of a lyconthrope's hair had been used in the
			 casting.
				-It's dark black.
		-We also asked to see the actual murder scene, and were led to an alley in a poorer area of
		 the city, complete with poorly cleaned bloodstains.
			-Dog did spot some wolf prints, apparently belonging to a large dire wolf.
			-The prints led South, but we eventually lost the trail.
	-We also checked in with the party gnome, who suggested looking to the sewers in the area,
	 saying there's "practically a whole undercity."
	-With nightfall, Liliana summoned something with scent, to follow up on our hair sample.
		-That led us to a spot where we found the tracks again, clearly shifting from wolf to man.
		-It was outside an abandoned temple, which we investigated.
			-Inside were old marks, symbols of Exaka, an overthrown god.
			-Dog spotted tracks leading to a secret door opened by a switch under one of the alters.
	-We left off there, having descended into some kind of dungeon, from the doorway of which we
	 could hear kennel-like noises.


-10/10/20: Bonus Saturday Dungeon Crawl
	-A gas trap guarded the first room behind the secret altar/door.
		-We found it the hard way, and disarming it took forever too, so it spread a liberal
		 amount of Constitution damage around.
	-While Joe was still disarming that, Conor broke down the door leading further inward and I and
	 Liliana charged through.
		-Rushing towards us was a wereboar and several smaller creatures.
		-As we fought them, they were joined by a wizard, who promptly animated the now dead wereboar,
		 and a werewolf that looks like it would fit our murders.
		-Conor nearly died and I burned quite a lot of power points, but we were able to overcome
		 them and ended the session there.
			-Sounds like there could be more creatures alive in here, though.


-11/12/20: Joe has a daughter!
	-Shit, the ceiling is coming down where those roots are burning.
	-Judicious use of Dimension Door got us to the other side of the flames, an area that looked
	 still stable.
	-Found a secret passage over there.
		-It even had a dropped pouch of coins and a potion.
		-The coins dated back to a predecessor kingdom, native to the area before the cataclysm
		 in the old world and the resulting immigrants.
		-In describing the god the coins were associated with, Jake suggested that gods indeed draw
		 strength from worship, and this god had declined as it was supplanted by the new culture.
	-We were indeed spared the collapse, and moved deeper into the temple, down a stairwell.
		-Below, we found some cultists who ritually surrendered to the constructs.
		-All of them are weird teenagers, abducted as kidds and raised into this shit.
	-We found another kid in a cave down on the third level, Niklos, in a cage on the third level.
	-Bribing the kids with magic food, we had Joe sweep the place while I asked them about dangers
	 and valuables.
	-They pointed to the jewel encrusted alter and the big green gem atop it when I aksed about
	 "shiny" stuff.
		-Gem on an alter raises my suspicions even with out Jake dropping hints, so we asked
		 Leliana to cast Detect Magic, checking both that and our loot from last session.
		-Gem is indeed magical, seemingly baring some necromantic curse (good spellcraft roll, there).
		-Leliana was able to take care of the ward with Break Enchantment, leaving us with a still
		 magic gem.
	-We found nothing of interest elsewhere in the tunnels, so we Dimension Doored up to the
	 surface.
	-We dropped the kidnapped kid off at his home temple, securing a small reward for solving the
	 murder as well.
		-We also left the cultists with them.
	-We then teleported back Xûl-Jarak.
	-Upon arrival, one of our rangers let us know that a gaunt undead creature had teleported to
	 the fortress's throne room, using the ley line.
		-It laughed maniacally while saying something they didn't understand, than disappeared again.
		-That occurred at midnight, a few hours before our arrival.
		-We immediately examined the area.
			-Conor's survival check identified both some odd dust and strange purple residue, both
			 likely tracked there by the undead creature.
		-Old notes suggest (at least) four places on the material plane that the ley line links to:
		 "Orcish inscriptions mention the location of the tomb, Xûl-Jarak, and two unknown places,
		 Shagol and Azuk"
		-Beansinger recalled a tail of the crimson sand of Azuk, site of an ancient massacre claimed
		 lich.
			-That odd dust is indeed red.
			-The massacre was so vile that people shunned the place, and sought to forget it.
			-Divination to the rescue!
				-Or not, as my otherwise successful vision is interrupted by the image of a skull.
				-The skull, though, was somewhat distinct: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/611563129809141800/776643560544010250
					-It's missing it's lower jaw and has a purple aura.
					-It reminds you of the symbol of some god, though you're unsure which.
	-Before bed I whipped up some Minor Creation breakfast for tomorrow, and then dumped the rest
	 of my power points into Quintessence.
	-The next morning, while Conor taxidermied that werewolf head, we checked in with the staff.
		-They mentioned there had been some skirmishes with the Firehand orc tribe, but nothing they
		 couldn't handle.
		-They've also seen Stonecrusher ogres scouting the area, but thus far they've stayed away.
			-Incursions by them they'll let us know about right away.
		-We suggested that, with something like that undead, they should let us know right away.
		-We also mentioned that they should be on the look out for member of the Onyx tribe, that
		 group of barbarians Conor has assumed control of and which we're looking to resettle in
		 the area.
	-We then teleported back to Melvaunt.
	-I created a passable rendering of the symbol I saw, and we took it around the temple district,
	 asking if anyone was familar with the symbol.
		-Most did not recognize it, but we got the door slammed in our face at the temple of Helm.
		-After clarifying we weren't _worshippers_ of the god, but seeking a beast protected by it,
		 they let us in.
			-They identified the god as Cyric, someone Helm has a history with.
				-Chaotic Evil
				-The god of deception, conflict, murder, lies, and illusions.
				-Famously petty, self-centered, and manipulative.
			-A cleric of Helm had failed to protect the town of Azuk, tricked by Cyric somehow into
			 massacre his own people, driving him into madness.
			-Those at the temple showed us a map with several locations they had searched for Azuk,
			 seeking to right their failure. They had found traces, but not the town itself.
				-They're all in The Tortured Lands.
				-Extending the leyline from Xûl-Jarak and the tomb does indeed lead through that
				 area as it passes through The Tortured Lands.
				-I made a quick copy of their map.
	-We should do some further research into the ley line itself.
	-First, though, we went to identify and otherwise deal with loot.
		-At The Wand & Griffin, we saw on of House Nather's spies arguing with the proprietor.
			-Apparently they had commissioned some weapons for elite troops but the proprietor
			 (Scrib) was unable to oblige due to a missing shipment of valuable ore.
			-We offered our help.
			-The proprietor mentioned that he had orderd the ore from Varachus of Ringus
				-Ringus being a portal city connected to The Outer Planes.
					-Heavily militarized, it's a center of the arms trade.
				-Varachus, meanwhile, is that arms dealer we impersonated to betray a demon.
					-Not a good sign that he's not fulfilling orders all of a sudden. . .
					-Hell, even if we find him, he's not likely to be happy if he knows that
					 was us.
	-We actually left off at the market on that island, returning to that black market merchant
	 to sell some of the historical occult stuff from the temple.


-Stuff to do next:
	-Knowledge(The Planes) concerning Ringus?
		-How is it accessed, given that it's an arms market? Are strangers welcome? What's the
		 planar key?
		-Answers:
			-The focus is a rod of iron.
			-Strangers are welcome if they follow the law.
				-Asking for clarification on the law, Jake gave the impression they're reasonable
				 city laws, not always walk backwards on Tuesdays or some such.
				-Enforced by various factions, including "The Mercykillers".
			-It is mildly lawfully aligned.
				-Pretty much everyone in the party is Chaotic, but would merely be uncomfortable,
				 not harmed.
			-One of 16 gate towns, linking the outer planes and The Outlands.
				-It provides access to Acheron, a plane of perpetual warfare.
					-A plane of floating cubes, hotly contested in the blood war, Ringus is one of
					 the few safe routes to Acheron.
					-Acheron is also lawfully aligned, maybe more so than Ringus.
	-Divinations?
		-For news of Varachus?
		-For information about Azuk?
	-Talk with Qebras about Varachus
		-We let him know Varachus had gone missing, but he had no further info on the demon lord.
			-Demons seem to think he's dead, but haven't found a body.
			-The demons are notable more chaotic as of late, which could mean things either way,
			 but might mean they're in to much disarray to cause an immediate threat.
	-Vist the library in Melvaunt and research the ley line further?
		-We did some research and learned some basics, that various ley lines span the continent in
		 a network, linking places and allowing travel.
		-We also heard mention of ley lines occasionally linking more directly in some way, but that
		 they could also in some way bind a life to them, and binding powerful casters even stronger.
		-Ley lines also respond to the schools of magic.
			-Evocation tends to send warmth.
			-Divination can somehow heal those bound to the line.
			-More powerful magics, more effect.
			-In some way, it may be possible to add required schools in some way, to the required
			 combination for a location, effectively changing the password.
			-It may also be possible to permanently seal it with wards, barring travel in either
			 direction, though that may anger creatures dwelling within the line.
	-Teleport to The Tortured Lands and find Azuk?
		-Look at Know Direction & Location
			-"The information is usually no more detailed than a summary that locates you
			 according to a prominent local or regional site."
			-That sounds like enough to figure out where we may have teleported to, combined with a
			 map and a knowledge of geography.
		-How do we "see" the area to teleport to it? We might have to travel there through some
		 other means, conventionally or maybe via the ley line.


-11/19/20: 
	-Retconning a bit, Liliana noticed something when we inspected the throne room where the undead
     creature had teleported to/from. We recalled that the ley line use we managed before involved
	 four schools of magic: Evocation, Divination, Transmutation, and Abjuration. Liliana noticed a
	 _fifth_ school involved here, Necromancy.
		-Interestingly, our old notes describe four possible destinations. If that corresponded in
		 some way to the four schools, perhaps a fifth location exists?
	-I had some awful Teleport rolls, teleporting to Qebras's.
		-First failure, Conor and I ended outside a farming town in the opposite direction.
		-Second failure, we ended up on a six mile wide floating disk, on the far Western edge of 
		 continent.
			-We were greeted by a orb that began flashing at our presence, and counting down from
			 10. We wisely got the hell out of there.
			-Finally making it to Qebras's, he actually recognized that island as the home of The
			 Council of Wizards.
				-He sold them their security orb.
	-Finally at Qebras's, we mentioned we were searching for the ruins of Azuk in The Tortured Lands.
		-He warned us to expect elemental extremes.
	-We took our leave of Qebras, riding the elevator down from his tower and setting out on astral
	 steeds.
	-About 3 hours into our journey, we reached what Qebras warned us of: waves of magical energy
	 pooled in low lying areas turning into lava, and causing extreme heat.
		-Cast Adapt Body and the others resorted to Endure Elements scrolls bought from Qebras.
	-Not long after, we stumbled on a quartet of fire giants, apparently gathering sulfer.
		-We were quickly at each other's throats, and they were quickly dead.


-11/25/20: Enter a crazy wizard and a tiny elf
	-House Nather called us back to Melvaunt.
		-They had some help for us, to track down Azuk and it's terrible inhabitent.
		-Beyond two folks joining us in Melvaunt, we were warned to look out for a cleric of
		 Tempus, their advance scout in the area.
		-The scout had also found a fortress they think may be our target, the Northernmost of
		 our possible locations.
			-Other elite warriors went missing. They would appreciate them returned, or destroyed if
			 they have risen as undead.
			-They will have House Nather badges on the person, and at least three are missing.
		-They also confirmed for us that our enemy is indeed a lich.
		-They also apparently have access to a wizard specializing in ley lines, who was able to scry
		 the fortress and warned that it was guarded by powerful illusions.
			-We asked to meet this person, and they introduced us to a middle aged elf named
			 Gerard.
			-He took us to his laboratory, where he had set up an apparatus mimicing the location of
			 the leyline node at Xûl-Jarak, with samples from the fort.
			-By using "a 5th level spell", one can scry the area 10' around the leyline nodes, though
			 it is risky and, if noticed, people have lost bits of their sanity.
				-Gerard even scribed the unique spell, "Leyline Scrying" into Ran's spellbook for him.
					-"Works as Scry but must be connected with a leyline. If noticed by another mind,
					 you must make a Will save or suffer from madness."
			-We also helped confirm for him the location of one of the other nodes, the one in
			 Kursk One-Tusk's tomb. He had known it existed, but not it's physical location.
				-We also informed him of the the inscription in the tomb mentioning two other nodes,
				 Shagol and Azuk.
				-He in turn mentioned having scried another node, far to the North, but they only see
				 ice there.
					-That may have some connection to the white dragon we fought in One-Tusk's tomb,
					 and, mentioning that to Gerard, he mentioned that dragons are known to travel
					 by the leylines.
	-We then opted to rest, and visit the nut house in the morning, to see the folks who failed
	 their will saves while scrying.
		-We stayed the night at that violin bar/inn in the nobles' quarter.
			-Ran got some looks.
	-After sleeping at the inn, we sold our fire giant loot, got Conor healed, and then went to
	 visit the asylum.
		-There, the scrying victims are busy chanting "I serve Neru!"
			-A Knowledge(Religion) check suggested that liches sometimes adopt a new name, and this
			 may be a fitting mockery of Nerull, the god of death.
		-They also seemed to be attempting to cast a spell, which Spellcraft identified as Polymorph.
			-They're not a high enough level to do so, though.
		-Ran attempted to read their thoughts.
			-He seemed to sense a _second_ mind in there, which stunned him, after telling him to flee.
				-That suggests he may have an int 10 higher than Ran.
				-Ran did get an image of a skeltal dragon with warforged wings, on fire.
					-Knowledge(History) suggested this was indeed a thing done by the ancient empire,
					 grafting warforged parts on to dragons (though it only succeeded with _undead_
					 dragons).
		-Break Enchantment was able to save one of these folks.
			-He spoke of a white floored chamber, with a flaming skull and a black knight, who exerted
			 some energy after which everything went black for him.
			-We should return to the asylum and rescue the rest. For now, though, we are still thinking
			 we may head to the fortress today, and direly need the spell slots.
	-We then returned to House Nather's compound, and attempted the scrying spell.
		-Ran predictably had to contest Neru's will, but made his Will save.
		-Ran saw some kind of ritual apparatus, constructed of bone.
			-Perhaps the lich's tools for interacting with the leyline.
		-There was also some kind of dark monster, perhaps the black knight.
			-It seemed to detect Ran, and approached him.
			-There were three other skeletal undead as well.
		-Interestingly, Ran seemed to be able to cast level one spells through the leyline. This
		 would be an intriguing thing to investigate further, as Jake hinted it perhaps could be
		 expanded.
	-With what we needed to reach the fortress in hand, we returned to the temple of Helm, to seek
	 buffs.
		-They requested we find them when we return, as they wish to initiate their own expedition,
		 to bury their long lost dead.
		-We got them to agree to have Undead Bane cast on our weapons, casting the Bane effect on
		 them when they are struck.
			-We're going to come back when we're ready to assault the fortress.
	-Ran suggested we cast Legend Lore to ascertain the details of the lich's phylactory.
		-It calls for expensive incense, so we ran by The Wand & Griffin.
			-We got enough for 2 castings.
				-Ran now owes you 50 gp.
			-You perhaps unwisely vouched for Jax's attempt to rent a Ring of Spell Turning.
				-Ran sealed it with a Geas, though.
		-It takes days to cast, with the info we have about the subject, so we're going to have some
		 downtime.
			-Dates:11/15/300 -> 11/22/300
				https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/781366345651453982


-Before next session:
	-Level up.
		-Done.
	-Downtime stuff:
		-Quarrying, Quintessence, and Fabricate. Also maybe paying hirelings?
		-Oh, Constructs too?
		-Write some decriptive stuff and post it in Discord?
			-Some blurb welcoming the new party member to the fortress, describing it a bit.
			-Description of the Fabricate construction.
		-All of the above is now done.
	-Undead assualt prep:
		-Powers:
			-Defensive Powers:
				-Inertial Armor 19
				-Vigor 19
				-Precognition, Defensive 19
					-Saves: "Temp +7 insight to all for Precog., Def."
				-Oak Body? 13
				-Conceal Thoughts (cheap!) 1
				-Elfsight (cheap-ish!)	3
			-Black Lotus extract, just because it's cheap? 1
			-Fortifications:
				-Jax/icyfinger can lift 1800 lbs. off the ground alone
				-Include artful scenes of the party smashing the undead you saw there!
			-Keen Edge for Joe's anti-undead weapon?
			-Construct to teleport with you? 17
				-You likely have just enough teleport capacity for one Huge one.
				-They can _definitely_ lift a lot in the way of fortifications.
	-Planning for during the assault:
		-Teleport in with your crystal and your construct.
		-Immediately, before your turn is over, manifest Temporal Acceleration and use the time to
		 create constructs.
			-Probably 2 per casting, with your augment, now that you can Overchannel to 19.
				-All melee? Maybe one that comes with is ranged? Whirlwinders?


-11/25/20:
	-Legend Lore Answers (plus some follow up Knowledge checks):
		-The phylactory is that set of mechanical dragon wings.
		-It's located on that dracolich we saw visions of.
			-It was cursed by Tiamat, and lost it's own wings.
			-The undead dragon is on it's own demiplane.
				-The plane is known as Draconia.
			-It's bold enough to wear it's own phylactory, an amulet, around it's neck.
			-The tuning rod for the plane is made of dragon bone.
				-About 2' long.
				-From at least an ancient dragon.
					-A suitably old dragon is said to still live in the capitol of the old empire.
						-It is an evil dragon, a red dragon.
						-Corsyd, Destroyer Of Life, from the intro page on Roll20.
							-"Chrexius had the oldest and most powerful dragon, Corsyd, Destroyer Of Life
							  and with his might, he was able to crush his enemies with the final battle
							  being the Battle of the Burning Plains that killed well over a hundred
							  thousand men."
						-Jake/Knowledge(Arcana) warned us it would be a difficult thing to defeat.
						-It is also said to have a warforged legion, loyal to it.
				-With my planar knowledge, I know how to shape it.
	-Ran proposed negotiating with the a suitably ancient dragon.
		-The cursed-by-Tiamat aspect of this might help with that, Tiamat being the god of evil dragons.
	-We asked 2d6 if he knew anything of the beast.
		-Didn't really learn much.
	-Ran also contacted some kind of wizard's research facility, floating above the  ocean separating
	 the new and old worlds, asking if they had information about Corsyd.
		-Apparently they do some amount of trade with Corsyd, exchanging gold for items he does not
		 want any longer.
	-Ran also proposed contacting something called a "Hoard Stealer".
		-Apparently, the specialize in robbing dragons, and were used by the Fae.
		-Hire one to steal something and then "recover" it and the thief?
		-Knowledge(Local) to the rescue! Thranton, in fact, got his start thusly.
			-That fact that we're planning to throw the thief under the bus probably rules out using
			 _him_, though.
			-Maybe he has a collegue he doesn't like. . .
			-So we teleported there.
			-Sure enough, he does!
			-Garrett, former partner and the bastard who turned him purple.
				-Ran also offered him some help with the purple.
					-Looks like it was done with a 6th level Transmutation spell, which we
					 identified as Baleful Polymorph.
	-We also want to see about building some kind of airlock around the area stuff teleports in.
		-Shit, something is still watching the area, with Scry Leyline.
		-Talking with House Nather's leyline expert, he suggested the area we should cover would be
		 a 20' square.


-Build leyline arrival point defenses
	-Airlock bunker:
		-A 20' square box, 10' high: 4*20*10+20*20=1200 ft.^3
		-Cost: 1200 * (1867/42) = 53,342 :(
			-Construct shifts quarrying required: 53342/(186.71*2)=142.85
				-Or 321 PP.
		-Fabrication:
			-160 ft.^3 per 11 PP casting.
			-Castings: 1200/160 * 11 = 7.5
			-Cost: 8 * 11 = 88
		-409 PP needed in total
	-I asked about getting away with free Glyphs.
		-Nope.


-12/9/20: 
	-We worked out a plan for building the bunker.
		-Ran is going to help out tomorrow, using Stone to Mud and Mud to Stone, while I utilize
		 constructs to haul it up, and then Fabricate it.
		-He needs to prepare the spells, 
	-Meanwhile, I burned the remainder of my power points for the 24th on road building while Ran
	 and Dog got to know Thranton better, smoking bowls and looking to learn more about Garrett.
		-Last seen at the site of the ancient battle of Yurtung.
		-He also learned an ancient art: he is a Daggerspell.
			-Arcane caster / rogue.
			-There is a monk/druid temple on the island of Lokamtha. Sounds like he learned it
			 there.
				-They might know something of his whereabouts.
				-It features "lizard looking things"
		-Ran also got Thranton to swear some kind of oath to aid us, for aid in return.
			-Notably that purple skin fix.
			-It also traded him some of those spell containing skulls for a discount for us.
				-Thranton gives us a 10% discount now going forward.
	-Ran apparently went for a different plan, and created a Force Cage covering the teleport
	 area, employing Permanency as well.
		-Joe observed some weird hag sacrifice going into it, in the middle of the night.
		-The next morning, we also warded it.
			-I placed a Glyph of Warding on it, triggered by the first creature to enter the area
			 enclosed by the Force Cage. It'll deal 5d8+6d10 Sonic damage, Reflex DC 24 for half.
			-Ran also added a Glyph of his own (Hold Person, DC 18) and Guards and Wards: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/guardsAndWards.htm
	-We then pressed Thranton for more details on this temple Garrett had been associated with.
		-He described the temple to us well enough we could Greater Teleport there.
		-He mentioned the monks use their powers defensively, and can likely be talked with.
			-They might even be amenable to business, selling healing and the like.
	-Everyone had various errands to run, including a trip to Melvaunt, so we opted to wait another
	 day before visiting the temple.
		-Ran again creeped about in the night, weirdly dosing a sleeping (though woken in the
		 process) with permanent Detect Magic.
	-We then Teleported to the temple.
		-Among the first things we noticed was that many of those at the temple were Dragonborn.
		-We asked a senior looking instructor if he knew anything of Garrett.
			-Conveniently, Garrett was memorably the only human to have sought training here.
			-It seems they keep tabs on former students, particularly ones with Garrett's. . .
			 aura.
				-They believe he has some kind of hideaway on the island itself.
				-Basically on the opposite end of this 300 mile long island, though.
				-The temple seems to think he's an asshole too.
					-Was kicked out after the disappearance of several other students.
	-We then Teleported to the area of Garrett's hideout.
		-We were able to teleport a little ways away, near the coast, and walked over to the area
		 suggested.
		-Dog's new permanent spell came in handy, as he spotted some kind of concealing spell.
		-Disabling the spell, Dog reached in, only for Garrett to grab him and threaten him with a
		 knife.
		-We explained we were there, looking to hire him to steal from a very dangerous dragon.
		-We left off formulating the plan.


-12/23/20: 
	-We continued our discussion with Garrett.
		-We revealed to him the name of our target, Corsyd, who he of course recogized.
		-Garrett apparently knows of the location of an Orb of Red Dragonkind.
			-That would certainly go a long ways.
			-He showed us a map of an island, containing a lab that holds the orb.
			-Enilias did a damned good job of lying, and Garrett took his word he'd get his share
			 of this treasure.
	-We then figured out what we knew about the island.
		-It also holds the gnomish town of Volkandorp.
		-It's located North of The Old World.
		-It's famous for its swordfish, and is both a homebase and vacation spot for scavengers
		 visiting the nearby Old World.
	-Through the joys of high level spellcasting, we (greater) teleported to Volkandorp.
	-We then commenced asking around town to figure out whatever we could that might be useful
	 in retrieving the orb.
		-Apparently the island once had a major dragon problem, and the orb was likely tied to its
		 resolution.
		-The volcano at the center of the island hasn't erupted in recent memory.
	-We also ate some damn good swordfish.
		-From talking with the waitress, this lab or whatever at the center of the volcano is
		 actively occupied. Workers sometimes come down to the restaurant.
		-She also confirmed the island had in the past a red dragon problem, since resolved.
			-They're drawn to the volcano.
		-She even recommended a fancy resort to us, which we stayed at after we finished eating.
			-It was indeed quite nice.
	-The next morning, we set out to the lab.
		-Dog helped us navigate up the volcano.
		-We planned to continue the tourist act, and go visit the lab.
			-Meanwhile, Enilias would slip inside.
	-We reached a gate with a "Keep out/Danger" sign in various languages, where we paused.
		-Seeing a dwarf coming up the mountain behind us, Enilias became invisible while I
		 put together a picnic.
		-When he reached us, we gave him our tourist story.
			-He was totally up for giving a tour.
		-Sounds like the danger is due to lava regularly flooding some of the tunnels.
			-The dwarf has some kind of elaborate wristwatch that he's using to time these and
			 avoid them.
		-We took the picnic sandwiches and beer to their lava encircled breakroom, and met some of
		 the lab's other employees.
			-Including one of the two wizards that head the lab, a pyromancer.
			-I took the opportunity to examine the dwarf's wristwatch while we talked.
				-Looks like it's magical, and beyond accurately providing the time, it incorporates
				 some form of tremorsense to predict the lava flows and warn the wearer.
				-I relayed info about it's use to the party in general, Enilias in particular.
		-Grabbing some heat resistant suits, or our own spells as suited us (fortunately, hidden
		 Enilias had an Endure Elements scroll), we continued the tour.
			-We witnessed the dwarf using his wristwatch to open doors somehow, holding it close to
			 some panel.
		-He led us to a lava filled chamber featuring _two_ floating orbs. 
			-Dog's permanent Detect Magic identified the much stronger one, pretty clearly our
			 artifact.
			-We talked the wizard's ear off, while Enilias snuck over to the orb and attempted to
			 steal it.
				-The other head of the lab, along with the pyromancer.
			-He slipped up, though, and we were caught.
			-I summoned two constructs, giving them improved grab, and told them to restrain the
			 wizard and dwarf as long as possible.
			-All of the party then teleported out, save Enilias.
				-He was trapped in some kind of energy orb by the wizard before he could escape via
				 his own, Ran-enchanted skull.
			-Enilias managed to work out some deal with the wizard, to borrow the orb, and, as soon
			 as I managed to contact him with Correspond, he told me to call off the constructs.
				-Apparently the leverage of being grappled by those monstrously large things went
				 a long ways in Enilias's negotiations.
				-We've got the orb for a week.
		-I picked up Enilias and, back at the fort, we discussed the details of our next step.
			-Keeping him innocent of the details, we talked with Ran about what we could do with a
			 gaeas skull.
			-We definitely want to keep this orb out of Garrett's hands.
				-What should we ward the orb with? I can manage a Glyph of Warding, at the cost of
				 200 gp.
			-How do we use this against the dragon, particularly without drawing his wrath down on
			 our heads, even after he gets Garrett?


1/1/2021:
	-We finalized the details of the plan.
		-We know the dragon's lair is somewhere in the vicinity of the capital city of The Old
		 Empire, but that's a bit unspecific
			-As such, I performed a Divination:
				-Question: How can we find the lair of Corsyd the Destroyer, from the capital city
				           of The Old Empire.
				-Answer: Seek not the highest heights, but the hottest heat. An unholy shrine to
				         war you should seek.
			-That rings a Knowledge(History) bell for me, having heard of a shrine maintained by
			 The Cult of the Dragon Below, Khyber.
				-Considered to be a corrupter of warforged.
				-It's located at Mt. Bane.
				-The library of Melvaunt had maps describing the area, sufficing to Teleport there.
		-We also collected a Geas skull from Ran, and put together a proposed contract:
			1. The whole of the stolen treasure will be brought to (insert agreed upon place here)
			   at (insert time here). If either party or member doesn't show up their share is
			   forfeit.
			2. We will not personally engage in violence against each other
			3. We will not impede each other following the splitting of the loot
			4. Garret will receive half of the take and the rest will go to the brotherhood of
			   Xûl-Jarak.
	-We then Teleported back to Garrett's hideout, and enacted the Geas.
	-Enilias also put together our disguises, taking a 20, so everything has an effective roll of
	 34.
	-With that, we teleported to The Old World.
		-We picked out a convenient landmark, near to Mt. Bane, one well described by the sources
		 we had available to us in Melvaunt (allowing us to teleport there).
	-We then made our way to Mt. Bane.
		-Along the way, we ran into some kind of lava worm, much like the one that had been guarding
		 the dragon orb.
		-It had nasty auras, but two constructs made quick work of it, once they arrived.
		-Upon reaching the mountain, we deviated from the path to the front door, instead opting to
		 scale it's wall.
			-Ed and Liliana opted to fly, with Ed carrying Beansinger, so Ed still has a 190 minute
			 duration Levitate cast on him.
		-From there, we entered the fortress the mountain had been carved into via some kind of
		 steam vent.
		-Inside, we found a series of corridors circling a large central chamber through which lava
		 was flowing through cut channels.
			-Wandering through the area was some number of warforged, patroling.
				-The first one we ran into got silently stabbed by Enilias, and then uncermoniously
				 dumped into the lava.
				-That didn't continue going smoothly, though, and eventually it turned into astral
				 constructs smashing other constructs until we fought our way down to the lower level.
			-On the lower level, we found the dragon.
				-My constructs smashed it's constructs, and landed a few solid blows on the dragon
				 itself.
			-We then got the fuck out of there, teleporting back to Xûl-Jarak, leaving the constructs
			 to distract it a little while longer.


-Level up before next session!
	-Done!
-I also created an Astral Seed, hidden in the basement of Xûl-Jarak.
	-Messaged Jake about it here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/796198673897488405
	-The message:
		 Something for our D&D game that other party members don't need to see:
		.   Back at the fort, after I level up and in the evening, I'm going to wander through one of the doors to the basement, and presuming I'm alone once inside the door, turn into a living shadow with this new power (suppressing the display while manifesting it): https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/shadowBody.htm
		.   After that, I'm going to stealthily move deeper into the basement, into #29 on Dungeon Level 1. Inside there, presuming it's unoccupied, I'm going to manifest (again, without display) Fabricate. I'm going to use it to remove one of the stones from the wall of the room, behind the sarcophagus to the far left, create a fist sized tunnel behind it a couple of feat deep. I then wish to manifest another new power, Astral Seed:
		https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/astralSeed.htm
		.   I'm then going to shove the resulting crystal down the tunnel, and then again cast Fabricate again. I want to brick up all but the deepest 6 or so inches of the tunnel, where the Astral Seed is, and replace the stone brick, disguising the disturbance as much as possible. The first one didn't likely require a roll (simple, and I have a huge skill bonus), but skill likely affects how hard this is to find, so I rolled some d20s in roll20. I got a 48 if this falls under Architecture & Engineering, but only a 29 if it's something else, like Stonework.
		.   Finally, I'm going to manifest Psychic Reformation, to remove Astral Seed from my power list, and replace it with and replace it with Mind Blank, Psionic (using 50 XP to avoid keeping a power on my list that I only need once per level or death). My shadow self is then going to slip back up to my room.
	-CAST SOME WARDS!


1/7/2021:
	-Ran apparently promised Corsyd that the orb would be returned that very night, so all of the
	 party save myself (being quite low on power points) teleported back to that island.
		-He promised not only to deliver the thief and treasure, but to "deal with the people with
		 the orb and see that it's taken from them".
			-He "dealt" with us by congratulating us, and we returned the orb.
			-In return, on top of a couple of teeth suitable for that focus, Corsyd also promised
			 The Brotherhood of Xûl-Jarak 3 favors, bound by Geas.
		-The wizards at the lab accepted it about as graciously as could be hoped, given that we
		 tried to steal it from them. Giving them the gems from that lava worm helped, since they
		 had some kind of interesting geomantic properties.
	-With that we prepped for our visit to the demiplane of Draconia.
		-I performed some divinations:
			-"Where on the demiplane of Draconia can we find the dracolich with warforged wings?"
				-"A protected complex above a swirling vortex."
			-"How big is the plane of Draconia 
		-Beansinger also contributed his Bardic Knowledge:
			-The plane is mostly a desert, with water being scarce.
			-It does hold a city, filled with rejects from the plane's master's search for the
			 perfect servant.
				-Perhaps our cleric/lich is that for the moment?
					-Sounds like he regularly replaces them.
	-With that, Enilias, Leliana, and I all went to scout Draconia.
		-We arrived near the edge of the plane.
		-We could indeed some structures on top of a dragon skeleton, likely the camp of escaped
		 servants.
		-We also saw the vortex we're looking for, in the air above us.
			-It was surrounded by floating platforms with obelisks on them.
			-No sign of the complex we're looking for, but it's supposed to be above the vortex,
			 and is thus likely blocked from view.
		-There were also skeletal Hieracosphinxs, flying in the distance, and they quickly spotted
		 us.
			-My Shadow Body wasn't helping much with hiding, given the bright desert we found
			 ourselves.
		-As such, I quickly teleported us to one of the floating platforms.
			-There, we found a skeletal figure with an outstretched hand that didn't really react to
			 us.
			-There were also many bones surrounding the obelisk.
				-We found a ring amongst them, one that appears to be tied to the test.
					-6 slots, for the 6 obelisks/tests.
			-We inferred this was a kind of test for the dracolich's servants, a test a wisdom, from
			 Leliana's reading of the arcane glyphs.
			-From there, we could indeed see the "complex", an inverted pyramid floating above the
			 vortex.
		-We then attempted to teleport to the top of the inverted pyramid, but found ourselves
		 instead atop some kind of dome of force, shielding it.
			-Apparently an epic spell.
			-Well, we've got a pretty good idea of what is necessary to earn an audience with the
			 dragon, those tests.
		-From there, we teleported to the city atop that skeleton, hoping to get some more
		 information from the escaped servants.
			-We snuck in, and then Enilias revealed himself to the mostly-dragonborn.
			-Initially hostile, the offer of a trip out of this hell hole quickly made them willing
			 to help.
			-The told us the 6 tests are tied to the 6 attributes.
				-Str:
					-Wear some heavy armor, with each hit not harming you, but making you fly
					 further, Super Smash style.
				-Dex:
					-Hide from the killer monster.
				-Con:
					-"Here. Drink this. Drink it."
						-It's poison or some such.
				-Wis:
					-_Find_ the hidden thing.
				-Int:
					-You must escape a magic sphere. Leliana suggested a powerful enough dispel
					 may do it.
				-Cha:
					-You become an intelligent sword in the sheath of a knight, in some kind of
					 simulation. You must convince the knight to kill his king.
			-Some tests may dispel enchantments and the like, perhaps stripping immunities from
			 you that might interfere with the test.
			-Asking if any here had seen the dracolich, we were told he rarely leaves his complex,
			 instead projecting his power outward through magic.
		-We then plane shifted back to the material, bringing the four dragonborn that helped us.
			-The dragonborn ran off the moment we did. I tried to offer them a place to stay at
			 Xûl-Jarak, but they were more interested in booking it.
			-There are 9 more there, which I'm game for helping, but argued we should delay that
			 until we deal with the dragon.
			-We then teleported back to Xûl-Jarak and relayed the details to the rest of the party.
			

-Figure out wards for your Seed!
	-You already picked up some components for a few castings.
	-Asked Jake about power storing details: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/799412405230108673
		-In short, you can augment them, but you also pay the augment cost.
	-Yep, Astral Seed is now warded.
		-Details of the ward:
		.   With the Glyph questions settled, before turning in for the night at the fort (I believe we left off having returned to it after Joe's and my scouting expedition), I want to spend some of my remaining power points to ward my Astral Seed. It being sealed in a wall, I'm going to teleport my psicrystal into the Seed's cavity with the powdered diamond and other material components, then channel the power through my crystal.
		.   I'm going to spend 20 points (and my psionic focus, to use Overchannel and Talented) on a Glyph containing Energy Bolt (Sonic). That's 20d6-20 sonic damage in a 120-ft. line, DC 28 Reflex for half. For the condition, it will be set to affect anyone that touches the Seed without holding in their mind a password ("electric desk mud"). Helpfully, the spell has an Auditory component, and sonic damage itself is bound to be loud, so I effectively get an alarm too.
		
		-Sent to Jake here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/799421034259677214
-Help those other escaped dragon servants.
	-There were another 9 of them.

1/14/21:
	-We discussed who would handle each challenge.
		-None of them are my problem, since Leliana can manage a better Dispel bonus.
		-We also picked up some attribute boosting spells for Ran, to help with a couple of the
		 challenges.
	-We then shifted to the plane and teleported up to the platform we'd previously been to, the
	 Wisdom test.
		-Enilias placed the ring in the skeleton's outstretched hand, and we then witnessed what
		 appeared to be his soul leave his body, drifting into the obelisk and disappearing.
		-While he was busy with the challenge, I then searched the platform while Ran rumaged through
		 the bones, of widely varying ages, that were scattered across it.
		-A short while later, a sword wielding tornado and some thri-kreen emerged from the portal.
			-They seemed surprised to see us there, and said something about us not being on the 
			 schedule.
				-Conor declared himself an anarchist unconcerned with such things before we could
				 ask them what the hell they were talking about, goading them to attack.
			-The tornado is apparently a "rage wind" someking of undead amalgamation of possessed
			 swords.
				-Unsurprisingly, it made whirlwind attacks on us.
				-Jerk tried to become invisible too, but Beansinger the party gnome took care of
				 of that with some glitter.
					-Glitter tornado!
			-I rolled shit initiative, but, on my turn, reached out telepathically to the thri-kreen
			 saying, "I always wanted to meet a thri-kreen! Are you guys with this tornado
			 douchebag? What's going on here?"
				-I'm kind of hoping they're involuntary subjects of the tests, and also I really 
				 _did_ always want to meet a thri-kreen.
			-The thri-kreen quickly fled, save for one killed by my party members before it could,
			 and Dog improbably managed to push the tornado off the edge of the platform.
		-Enilias eventually returned, having chased some kind of creature through some
		 extradimensional ruin, playing hide and seek.
	-We then sent the construct through the portal, and then followed it.
		-It did indeed lead to another of the tests, the Constitution one.
		-Dog drank the drink.
			-No problem for his guts.
	-Next portal!
		-It was the Charisma one, so Ran stepped up to his sword in the stone.
		-He, uh, may have been a bit overconfident in attempting this.
		-He eventually convinced the now-drunk knight to murder his king with a broken brandy bottle.
		-Some small creature tried to steal the ring, but Enilias spotted it and called out, and
		 it then teleported away.


-Ward the ring to deal with further theft attempt?
	-What allowed trigger will exempt both the party and the skeletons?
-Probably should cast Mind Blank on yourself.
	-Done.


-1/23/21:
	-With the Charisma challenge completed, we passed through the portal to the next one.
		-It appeared to be the strength challenge we were told of, given the suit of full plate
		 next to the obelisk, connected to it via tubes of some kind.
		-Jaxx stepped up to the challenge, and donned the plate.
			-Next thing _he_ knew, he was on some kind of bridge, fighting polygons, and indeed
			 experiencing Super Smash-style damage.
			-To the rest of our eyes, he simply stood there, frozen in the armor.
	-Jaxx completed the challenge successfully, though was injured in the course of it.
	-After the challenge, the bones on the platform swirled together, forming first the shape of a
	 five-headed dragon, then into the shape of a humanoid, which proceeded to bellow at us.
		-Something to the effect of, "You're close! Kill him!"
		-Poor Knowledge(Religion) checks suggested this was some kind of projection, but we didn't
		 know more.
		-It then dropped a bag, which Ran was foolhardy enough to run over and immediately open.
			-Inside were Oils of Magic Weapon, Greater, which we somehow instinctively knew what
			 they were (more of this projection's magic?).
				-Seems like somebody is trying to help.
			-There was also a holy symbol of Tiamat, which Ran grabbed.
	-This time, as we passed through the portal on the platform, it dumped us back on the desert
	 below, with no portal behind us.
		-Probably a consequence of us starting at a random platform.
		-Dog, with a survival check, was able to work out from landmarks seen which platforms we
		 had already been to, so Leliana and I quickly teleported the party to an unvisited
		 platform, since the flying skeletal sphinxes were again taking notice of us out on the
		 desert.
	-This platform turned out to be the Dexterity challenge.
		-Upon arrival, my psicrystal alerted us to signs of life behind the obelisk.
		-Enilias stealthily circled around the platform, and saw a pixie messing with the
		 mechanisms of the obelisk.
			-He grabbed it, and dragged it over to the party.
			-Ran, well versed in the ways of the fey, interrogated it, theatening it with a geas.
				-It was attempting to make the challenge somehow harder, for the lulz.
				-Ran convinced it to reverse it's modifications.
		-Enilias then began the challenge.
		-During the challenge, I cast Detect Remote Viewing on myself.
		-Sadly, Enilias failed the challenge, taking some Dex damage.
			-As Enilias came too, the skeleton suddenly animated, and began to close it's hand on
			 the ring.
			-Ran, using some teleport trick, snatch the ring before it could.
			-That drew the dragon's attention.
				-I detected it scrying us through the skeleton in some fashion.
				-It also spoke through the skeleton, demanding a life in exchange for the failure.
					-Attacks on the skeleton seemed to cause the platform to crumble as well.
					-Ran summoned some red caps and, after some confusion, Leliana cutting one of
					 their throats seemed to solve the problem.
						-The dragon warned us a substitute would not be allowed for another failure.
		-With Lesley having gotten some coffee, it occurred to him/Ran that we could follow the
		 pixie's example, and mess with the challenge's settings.
		-Sure enough, Ran was able to render the challenge extremely easy, and Enilias passed it on
		 the second try.
	-We then passed through the platform's portal, and found ourseles at our last challenge.
		-Through more tweaks by Ran, Liliana passed it easily.
	-After the final challenge, all platforms began to slowly drift towards the pyramid.
		-Some quick observations (and tons of Knowledge(Arch&Eng)) suggested we had 30 minutes.
		-Ran ran off to go cash in a favor with Corsyd, returning a short while later with a fiery,
		 malevolent humanoid.
		-The rest of us cast what buffs and healing we could, and prepared to face the dracolich.
	-Once the platform reached the pyramid, we saw the dracolich, surrounded by flesh golems, a
	 death knight, and what appears to be the bastard lich that kept fucking with us via leyline.
		-The dracolich gave us some speech about how we'd now server it, whether we willed it or
		 not, to which Jaxx succinctly responded by burying his giant axe in the nearest enemy at
		 hand.
			-The end of the dracolich had begun.
		-I tortured Jake by using my first action, plus Temporal Acceleration, to summon four more
		 flying pouncer constructs, in addition to the two I summoned on the platform.
			-Not only did they demonstate to the dracolich the many useful application of
			 prodigious blunt force, they also, via attacks of opportunity, tripped the death
			 knight that was rushing to heal the dracolich, slamming him face first into the steps.
		-When Corsyd's initiative came around, he lept onto the dracolich's wings and used his
		 breath weapon on the point the creatures mechanical wings were joined to it.
		-That dracolich is twice dead, now.
			-The other lich with it, too. Should solve our leyline issue.
			-Don't think it ever even got to act.
	-With the dracolich's death, the pyramid began to fall.
		-Corsyd used Wish to transmute the dracolich's gold pile into a giant ball, grabbing it and
		 flying off.
		-Jaxx grabbed the death knight's corpse, one of my constructs the lich's, and then we plane
		 shifted out of there, before the pyramid plummetted into that negative energy vortex it was
		 hovering over.
	-Back on the material, we negotiated with Corsyd further.
		-We spent the two favors, and Ran's staff, to get him to split the gold with us and the magic
		 items embedded within which survived the magma.


-Level up!
	-Done!
-Buy stuff!
	-Nothing in the loot really interests you, but you should be getting very nearly 53442.5 gp.
		-Splitting items with Corsyd might fuzz that slightly.
	-Probably time for the Torc of Power Preservation
		-You'll need to ditch your amulet of natural armor.
		-Ask Jake about obtaining it over downtime.
	-Maybe the Stone of Good Luck too?
		-You'll be very near broke after both. Less than a grand left.
			-Ah, actually, thanks to your discount on magic stuff, that should be less true.
			-Actually, no discount, since I have to get it in Sigil.
			-But, you're also getting a share of a 20k downpayment on that artifact armor, so that
			 should solve the issue.
	-Asked about the above two: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/803142313433366528
		-Sounds like I can via a side trip to sigil: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/804563114426761228
			-Write down that focus, at the cost of some silver pieces.
-Figure out item split with Corsyd!
	-Eh, none of them appeal to you, so you're mostly interested in getting exactly half the sale
	 value.
-Figure out _extended_ downtime!
	-11/28 to 3/15
		-All months are 30 days.
		-105 days of downtime in total, according to Jake.
	-You have 324 power points now.
		-Daily reserve / non-productive spend:
			-20	Inertial Armor
			-28	2 x Greater Teleport
		-Leaves 276 to spend each day of work.
			-Can make 138 medium constructs, or 3312' of road.
				-Actually, half that road, due to Winter: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/804559960893292554
				-170568' done if you do nothing but that for 103 days, or 32.30 miles.
					-Leaves 2 days in which to make a trip to Sigil and any other such activities.
	-What about the fortress's laborers?
-Address the now-vacant plane of Draconia?
-Deal with that Draugerplate
	-Raised the issue here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/803357009125572648
	-Shit, dealing with the guy inside is going to be an issue.
		-Dealt with!
	-Sounds like we're going to try and sell it through that black marketeer in Wilba.
		-Got a 20k downpayment.


-2/4/2021
	-Sounds like, though Spring is beginning, it'll still be a week or two before House Nather is
	 sending troops our way.
	-As such, we had some time to follow up on our loose threads. We identified four:
		-Those Eleven Separatists
		-The Black Syndicate's activities in Melvaunt
		-Those Warforged in that tower
		-The Plane of Draconia
	-We decided that laying claim to Draconia was the most urgent, though it sounds like Enilias
	 will be tasking some spies to follow up on The Black Syndicate's activities.
	-As such, we cast some protective spell and then shifted to Draconia
		-I was then curious how large it was.
			-It's about 50 miles X, Y, and Z.
		-We aimed for that village of rejected servants, and ended up roughly 13 miles from there.
		-We opted to travel overland, first there, and then roaming further.
			-As such, I summoned some quadruped utility constructs, as mounts.
		-After only a short distance, and in keeping with past behavior, the still-circling sphinxes
		 took notice of us, and four of them flew towards us.
			-This time, we dismounted, stood our ground, and battled them.
			-As the first skeletal sphinx died, it let out a horrible scream.
				-In response, the ridge Ran was taking cover behind, which Dog had noticed only
				 only moments before had a magical aura, rose from the sands, revealing itself to
				 be a trio of Greater Stone Golems.
			-Fortunately, as we fought, the other flying sphinxes, off in the distance, took no
			 interest.
				-It seemed like groups of them were set to guard different areas or the like, and
				 we might attract the attention of more of them elsewhere.
					-Yeah, there was a hole in their formation, once we took these guys out.
			-After we defeated that batch of enemies, I sent my three constructs off to battle the
			 next nearest formation of sphinxes.
				-We'll deal with any outcome there between sessions


-2/13/2021:
	-Jaxx having told us he'd be done with what he was doing with his fighting pit about now, so
	 Liliana and I shifted back to The Material.
		-Liliana to contribute some teleports, given Plane Shift's inaccuracy.
		-(Jaxx was busy last session, and is now back.)
	-At the fort, one of our rangers flagged us over too.
		-Apparently a Leonal, giving the name of Ivixel, had stopped by the fortress, asking our
		 aid and leaving a letter.
			-Leonals are good aligned outsiders.
			-Sounds like he resides on the plane of Elysium.
				-Four layers to this inner plane.
				-The focus is a piece pure steel.
			-He wanted help with a planar auction of some kind.
		-Something about a planar auction.
	-We then returned to the rest of the party and continued on to the village.
		-A dragonborn there, Arnash, was very helpful.
			-I carefully shook his hand, to later Correspond.
		-He told us that, residing there were 50 dragon born, and a small amount of others.
			-Thri-kreen
			-Planar somethings? The person we spoke to did not know.
		-He also believed that the dracolich was _not_ responsible for the creation of this plane,
		 or at least not the obelisks.
			-Instead, he'd heard the dracolich's guards occasionally threatening people with being
			 fed to the mindflayer, and suspects that creature to be the plane's creator.
			-He seemed to know quite a bit about mindflayers, lending credence to his story.
	-I also informed the party of our lion letter, and I then reached out to the creature via
	 Correspond.
		-He was seeking our service as _diplomats_.
		-He said he would send us a "golden raven", and asked our location.
		-I told him to send it to us this evening at the fort.
	-Jake also informed me that I was aware of some kind of planar registry and senate.
		-Apparently they may be an option for some form of _exterminators_, to rid the plane of evil.
		-We think the plane is not likely registered with them, given it's pervasive evil.
		-We could get in contact with them in Sigil.
	-We then returned to Xûl-Jarak, to await our raven.
		-Sure enough, a golden raven arrived that evening.
		-Ran, though, wanted to wait until the morning, to which the raven assented.
		-We then all left for Elysium, and met with Ivixel.
	-Apparently the janni on the elemental plane of earth have acquired a diamond mine.
		-It's known as "The Valley of Light".
		-It's what is being auction, in a neutral realm known as The Demiplane of Glomming.
			-Well, perhaps it's more of some kind of debate? He mentioned a translation error.
		-In return, he offers us each a magic item of our choosing (up to 90k) and to place a
		 pool of the waters of Oceanus at a place of our choosing on the material plane.
			-A single ounce of it can sustain a medium creature, as food and water, for a day and
			 affect them as Restoration. A 15 oz. jug is worth 10k.
		-Ivixel handed me a palladium fork, a focus for reaching the The Demiplane of Glomming.
			-A craft check suggested it's made of palladium, but also that I could plausibly split
			 the fork into two smaller ones, still suitable for use.
		-Negotiations begin in 3 days, and will then last a week.
			-It is currently 3/17
			-During that week, we should not leave. To do so will not _forfeit_, but we'll be looked
			 on very disfavorably.
			-Supposedly, our safety is guaranteed, though duels are apparently not unheard of.
		-The janni have invited the 5 best offers, Ivixel's among them.
	-Well, what should we prep in the 3 days we've got?
		-Ran suggested finding out who the other diplomats may be.
		-Perhaps ask around Sigil?
	-We opted to head to Sigil.
		-We found an elemental bar, to ask around.
		-Well, Enilias then thought to go pursue something that would let him speak relevant tongues,
		 so we swung by the magic shop I'd visited over the winter.
		-With the item in hand, we headed to the bar.
		-Ran purchased a bottle of something fit to knock an earth elemental on it's ass.
		-Dog also drank something unwise and regrew his tail, now four feet long and not seemingly
		 under his control.
			-After a successful will save, he does seem to have some control over it.
			-Apparently it can do "chaotic" damage?


-Look into that planar registration stuff in downtime.
	-Posted a reminder about the issue a day before our next session: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/814618098270470184
	-Ah, a requirement, the meeting of which is still in our future:
		-"They are going to want a stable portal from Sigil that you are able to protect and not
		 allow unauthorized traffic into the city (you would be liable for monsters that can be
		 traced to that portal etc)"
	-And the benefits:
		-"Once you have it registered and you pay an administration fee (1000 pp), things purchased
		 in Sigil can be delivered there and contractors can be employed to update things on the
		 plane or update the properties of the plane"


-2/26/21:
	-Jaxx is again out, of in search of beasts for his fighting pits.
	-Enilias pressed the bartender for information on the Janni and the diamond mine deal, who
	 steered us to the Lady's District, where diplomats and the like can be found.
	-Walking out of the bar, someone barreled past us, followed by two others yelling some variation
	 on, "Stop! Thief!"
		-I undetectably disappeared the pursued, with Time Hop, while Enilias and Ran made
		 buddy-buddy with the pursuers.
		-Apparently they're from the Harmonium, more vigilantes than law enforcement, but, Sigil
		 being fairly laissez faire, they're most of what it's got.
		-Ran Charmed one of the two pursuers, suggested he must have planeshifted away, and led the
		 guards off.
		-When the thief returned, Dog grabbed him.
			-Apparently he'd stolen a "Lens of the Desert", as part of some scheme to rob a wealthy
			 vampire.
			-Enilias pressed him for an introduction to the city's thieves's guild.
	-We went to meet with those thieves.
		-The leader of the group we met was an efreet, Jackal.
		-Interestingly, an orc there was very intrigued by Dog's tail.
		-There's also a dragonborn named Armac.
		-They seek to rob an elder vampire, The Black Duke, who lives in The Underdark.
			-They have plans of his hideout.
			-Ran and Enilias both spilled far too many details of what we were doing with these folks.
				-Mentioning the diamond mine, which the thieves were of course curious about.
				-Mentioning the plane, which the thieves seemed interested in moving goods through,
				 as long as it is _un_registered.
					-It did sound like they might be able to help us with the portal, though.
			-They also had information on our competitors in the diamond deal.
				-One set would come from Mechanus.
					-Led by a monk, their bid is likely to be straightforward and unimaginative.
				-They also suggested that divination may aid us.
			-To enhance our credibility, Ran offered a plane tour, to demonstrate we had the goods.
				-He also helped Ran learn "Precise Plane Shift", a spell level higher but which
				 arrives on target.
					-Huge deal. I wonder if I could adapt this to psionics?
	-I then performed a divination, seeking who our competion will be in the diamond deal.
		-In return, I saw visions:
			-Claudliplude the 12th, king of the Xorns, eating gems.
			-Marsk, some kind of naval officer.
			-And our Mechanus Monk, who is apparently some form of construct.
				-Xin Omega, Mouthpiece of Primus
			-A fox-like creature with glowing orbs, the vision of whom was notably hazy.
				-Perhaps warded against divination?
				-We recognized it as being an arcanaloth, though, known for their craftiness.
					-They're also quite evil, servants of the Yugoloths of Gehenna.
			-A large horned and bespectacled creature, similarly hazy.
				-A mercane, a race of 12' tall blue-skinned merchants.
			-Amir Utha Alzmed, a Janni, will be our moderator.
	-We also looked more into the Janni.
		-Very martial, they revere strength, but also fairness.


-Level up!
	-Done
-Freeze some living creatures in Quintessence for assimilation on demand.
-Figure out any other stuff you want to research for the next session, on the other diplomats.
-Jaxx has found some kind of damaged trade route in the wilds that we could perhaps repair: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/820059917741981727


3/13/21:
	-Jaxx found us, teleporting into the middle of our meeting with thieves.
	-We then continued to hash out the details of some kind of smuggling portal arrangement.
	-Disconcertingly, the thieves's wizard became excited at the mention of Melvaunt.
		-Apparently they're after that artifact we delivered from demonic possession in Glister to
		 the college of wizards in Melvaunt.
			-That seemed less than wise to me, and I broadcast as much to the party.
			-Better it remains within our reach.
			-Indeed, a Knowledge(Arcana) check suggested it could, beyond creating sentient
			 constructs, it could also perhaps be used to steal XP for magic item creation, though
			 with some chance the result is cursed.
		-They also seem interested in visiting (and looting) the territories of The Old Empire.
	-Afterwards, I went in search of a jar of crickets, for Assimilate: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/assimilate.htm
		-Qebras might love that pet store.
		-Dog also investigated a chaos beast, and we learned of The Chaos Nexus, a chaotic cousin
		 of Sigil, where the portals lead to random places.
			-The beast had been destined for one Behrtio, a collector of chaos, but who had not
			 been seen in some time.
			-Dog's new tail is really interested in the beast. Seems it likes chaos.
	-As we walked through the streets afterwards, we were accosted by devil assassins.
	-We made short work of them, abducting one of them and dragging them back to Xûl-Jarak.
		-Tortured and enscrolled, he revealed to Ran that he had been paid by Sharlocke, located on
		 the Demiplane of Glomming. Gehenna was also mentioned. Perhaps this is the arcanaloth we
		 will be bidding against.
		-Ran carefully collected it's head. After all, necromancers can speak with the dead.


3/26/21:
	-We did our first round of questions for another random player.
		-We learned Enilias hails from the kingdom of E-something, and exiled noble who offended
		 others among his class back home. (Encantris?)
		-I told Enilias what I remembered of my old life, and how it feels almost like something
		 that happened to someone else.
		-I asked Ran why the fey fascinate him so. Apparently he stumbled across a timeless Unseelie
		 Court, in the feywilds near his home. He also spoke of they way that, rather than knowing
		 magic, they _are_ magic, and the world bends to them. Ran pointed out that this should
		 resonate with me, as one who _is_ psionic, and indeed it did.
		-Liliana, it would seem, does not really know where here magic comes from, what sorcerous
		 ancestor she may have.
		-Jaxx talked of his time guarding the Northern wilds, of the beasts and poachers he battled
		 there. He's a wild elf; they protect the forest and the forest provides.
		-Ran also seems to be searching for an enemy.
			-Uh oh: "Who is greater than The Brotherhood?"
			-Sounds like we might need to find Ran and enemy, and/or keep an eye on him.
				-He didn't seem willing to accept Pandorym, and kind of thinks we could take Corsyd
				 too easily to qualify too.
	-Doing the above in the fort's bar, we also overheard another patron talking of strangeness in
	 the woods nearby, and how it would soon be a full moon.
		-Out on The Ride, he said, there's wolves everywhere. . .
		-We warned Haravak, suggesting he relay the news to our rangers, and keep them close to the
		 fort.
	-The next morning, it was time for the debate/auction/whatever. We buffed up and shifted to The
	 Demiplane of Glomming.
		-Upon arrival, we were greeted, and shown to our quarters.
		-Ran immediately reported that we had been assaulted by one of the other bidders, but the
		 janni showing us about seemed less than perturbed, so long as the attack had happened
		 elsewhere.
			-That we showed the strength to survive the attack, though, seemed to speak well of us
			 in his eyes.
	-We settled into our room, awaiting the dinner at which we'd meet the other diplomats.
	-We saw the ogre servants of the mercane merchant, and Commodore Maersk's 7 Bralani warrior
	 sisters entering their room.
		-Ed's Knowledge(Nobility) identified the last, while Dog made buddy-buddy with the ogres
		 in their language, learning of their master.
	-Through another door, Enilias heard the whirring of machines, and called me over.
		-Given my formidable mechanical knowledge, I suspected them to be the support machines that
		 keep our rivals from Mechanus. . . in sync with their homeland. I suspect, given enough
		 time, I could likely sabotage the things.
		-Though the East and SE rooms had wards, this one did not.
			-The mercane is in the SE room.
	-With that, we headed to dinner.
		-Much banter ensued.
		-Ran was happy to plop the assassin devil onto the table, confronting the arcanaloth.
			-The way it shook out seems to have made Sharlocke look bad, but Xin of Mechanus look
			 good.
	-After dinner, we proceeded to get the Commodore very drunk, offering him Edric created wines,
	 and eventually musically egging him on into a drinking contest with Dog.
		-He managed to _win_ that last, but Beansinger also managed to Fascinate him into chugging
		 the Tyrium wine, probably rendering him mute for a couple of days.
	-We had some time back in our room after dinner, and did another round of questions-by-initiative.
		-We learned Liliana knew Enilias from school.
		-Enilias sounds like he's got some hooks in the spymaster for House Nather.
		-We learned that Ran is the way he is, in part, to keep people guessing, a survival
		 technique from his time among the Unseelie.
	-The next morning names were drawn. It seems we'll debate Xin first.
		-Maersk also challenged us to a duel, which the Janni seemed surprisingly amenable to.
		-We debated the terms of it:
			-Earth was the element, so we'd be fighting on solid ground.
			-Dog and the Commodore will be fighting one on one with no weapons and no armor.
	-Next session will start with the duel, followed by us debating Xin if we win.
		-It'll be the second debate of the day, so we may get some idea of what the Janni respect.


4/9/21: The Duel!
	-The Janni laid out the terms of the duel.
		-We're fairly thoroughly prevented from interfering, with a mix of Silence and Antimagic.
		-We do, though, as a result of choosing "Chaos" as one of the duel parameters, get to
		 screw with a bunch of levers controlling various traps: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/830207496793751583/830207759684337724
	-The Commodore cautiously threw out a coin, triggering one of the traps, and then took a full
	 defensive.
	-Dog blindly ran forward, charging the bastard in a rage.
	-Meanwhile, The Sisters dropped a spinning club on Dog while we hit The Commodore with a chunk
	 of the ceiling, knocking him prone.
	-It turned into a wrestling match, ultimately ending when The Commodore broke Dog's grapple
	 and dashed away, only to fall into a trap we'd moved.
		-His "Sisters" dashed for the lever that would save him, but Liliana had already
		 polymorphed it into rubber. Cartoon solutions are the best solutions.
	-Our Xorn rival congratulated us on the victory, and inquired if perhaps we could help him in
	 his own confrontation with Sharlocke, offering a 25k gp. ruby in exchange for either further
	 incriminating Sharlocke or simply arranging a meeting between the two of them.
		-Ran was like, "I've got this," concocting some dubious plan involving polymorphing the
		 Xorn king into one of us after having arranged some meeting between _us_ and the arcanaloth.
		-Enilias went to meet with Sharlocke, in service of that.
	-Enilias also found his way inside the Mechanus delegation's room, messing with their machines.
		-Threw a wrench in the gears, as it were.
	-Ran eavesdropped on the conversation between the arcanaloth and the xorn.
		-Well, went a good bit further than that, attempting to dominate the arcanaloth.
		-That didn't work, so Ran messed with the xorn's head instead, with something called
		 "Remorseless Charm", leading to him attacking the arcanaloth.
			-http://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/champions-of-ruin--27/remorseless-charm--277/index.html
	-Sharlocke ran off to find the Emir, reporting the assault.
		-Meanwhile, Ran broke the enchantment on the xorn king.
		-Sharlocke cited _Ran_ as the one who could confirm his story.
		-Never content with the current quantity of chaos, Ran took the xorn's side, claiming that
		 Sharlocke provoked the assault.
	-The Emir employed a Zone of Truth to settle the matter, but that was no match for Ran's Mind
	 Blank.
	-Ran stuck to his story, that the arcanaloth had bated the xorn and then exagerated the assault.
		-That earned us our gem.
	-Meanwhile, Enilias tried to sneak a look in Sharlocke's seemingly bloody bag, but was caught
	 by the arcanaloth.
	-Ran took the opportunity of Sharlocke grabbing Enilias's hand to goad the arcanaloth further,
	 mocking him and even counterspelling Sharlocke's attempt to teleport away.
		-Sharlocke fairly heroically managed to keep his cool, and stomp off.
	-Enilias also managed to steer Xin-Omega towards suspecting _Sharlocke_ as the one who
	 vandalized his room.
	-Enilias pushed many of the other participants towards _sharing_ the mine.
		-He got the support of all left save Sharlocke.
	-With our campaign of slander (and also some legit accusations) against Sharlocke, and everyone
	 else being agreed to _split_ the mine, the emir agreed to the split and also pronounced
	 judgement on the arcanaloth, sentencing him to death at our hands.
		-We strode into the guest quarters to the South, which the arcanaloth had filled with steam
		 by vaporizing the central pool in an earlier fit of rage.
		-There my constructs pulped his hellhounds while the arcanaloth shapechanged into something
		 even more devilish.
		-Sharlocke bought himself some time, putting a wall of force in between him and us, and
		 flew up towards the ceiling.
		-I Dimension Doored to the other side of it, bringing Jaxx, Dog, and one of my existing
		 constructs.
		-I also Temporally Accelerated, conjuring another set of (now flying) constructs
		 surrounding Sharlocke.
			-They proceeded to kick the shit out of him.
		-His construct-beating eventually triggered some contingent spell, Plane Shifting him out
		 of there.
		-Well familiar with him and possessed of ample quantities of his blood, we were able to
		 easily Scry him, finding him at the mouth of the very diamond mine we were haggling over.
		-We Plane Shifted and Teleported to him, resuming the fight.
		-He was quickly pulped, but that wasn't the end of things! The oozy pulp climbed the body
		 of one of my constructs and somehow invaded it, wresting control of it from me.
		-The construct was soon dismissed, though, and the ooze then soon dead, shattered by a
		 Shout from Beansinger.
	-However, we could also hear the noise of battle coming from the mine. Hordes of demons and
	 devils were doing battle inside the mine.
		-We overheard the name of one of the leaders: Semeska the Marauder, apparently a devil lord.
		-We also heard mention of "The Staff of the Planes".
			-Ran knew the name, and all it's details: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/830281777314005012			
	-We left off with a general notion of resting, regrouping, and then clearing the mine.
		-The many new co-owners of mine, and perhaps the betrayed emir, all seem motivated to aid
		 in this.


-Level up!
	-Will mean talking to Jake about followers ASAP, given that Thrallherd doesn't give easy reason
	 to delay.
		-Talked on voice.
		-PC classes and race choices are based on where you're hanging around long enought to attract
		 them.
		-Using Pathfinder rules for how fast believers arrive: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/psionic-prestige-classes/thrallherd/
			-"A thrallherd’s thrall and believers arrive within 24 hours. Lost thralls are replaced
			 within 24 hours. Believers arrive and are replaced at a rate of the thrallherd’s
			 leadership score per day, with the lowest level believers arriving first. If the
			 thrallherd is in a location where thralls and believers cannot reach, none arrive
			 until she moves to a location where she can be reached."
				-Jake mentioned Kobolds, which are _super_ attractive for mining.
	-Getting to Thrallherd Reformation:
		-Fix two feats and add 4 ranks to Diplomacy
		-The two feats require going back two levels, thus costing 100 XP (deducted it!).
		-Applied the above to the character sheet!
			-The skill ranks came from Knowledge(The Planes), which you probably want to boost back
			 up.
	-Huh. Diplomacy provides no synergies, but would get +2 if you bring Bluff up to 5, and you
	 already have 2 ranks in that.
	-Done:
		-Sheet header
		-Applied Thrallherd table.
		-XP
		-Ability bump
		-PP
		-Skills
		-Psicrystal
	-I think that's it save the followers and such.
		-Thrall (15th level):
			-Jake didn't want to deal with the Factotum.
			-LN cleric?
				-Of someone civilization or mind oriented?
					-That Pathfinder diety?
			-Expert?
				-6+Int skill points per level. Any ten skills are class skills.
			-Beguiler is also very solid.
				-Gives you 6+Int too, and seems like it might give every class skill I care about: https://dndtools.net/classes/beguiler/
				-The spells are largely limited to stuff you're not interested in, though.
			-DMG II Business rules?
			-A Phrenic creature or Aasimar?
				-Hmm. . . business rules care deeply about _ranks_ of secondary skills.
					-Probably rules out Aasimar, but the powerful Phrenic abilities might be
					 worth it.
						-Ehhh: "Similarly, creatures who advance by character class are usually not
						 phrenic creatures—they simply take levels in a psionic class to hone their
						 mental powers."
			-Make them elderly, for those sweet mental stat bonuses?
			-A Doppleganger?!?
				-LA of 4 and 4 racial HD.
				-+2 to all stats, save +4 to Wisdom.
				-Eh, might be fun, but probably not worth it and not really Ed's style.
		-Proposal:
			.   I think I've formulated a general Thrall concept I'd be interested in, which I wanted to run by you. I've been reading through the rules for running a business again (DMG II, pg. 180), since that seems like a good model for some of the downtime stuff I'd like to do with this guy. Business, particularly the Shop or Moneylender ones I'm eying, tend to benefit from social and profession skills. As such, I've been eying various skillful classes and options for mental bonuses, and arrived at the idea of a middle-aged-or-older Phrenic-human Expert.
			.   I'm imagining the thrall as a formerly successful merchant, now rather down on his luck. The son of a wealthy merchant family, he was passed over as it's heir because his family shunned him for his strange inborn psionics. Intent on showing them the error of their ways, he worked in the family business that would never be his until he could afford to strike out on his own. Driven by how they wronged him, he eventually surpassed them on his own. His vengeance in hand, though, he found it did not make him happy. Pursuing his goal relentlessly, he never started a family of his own and, his goal acheived, the wealth brought him no further joy. In a downward spiral, he squandered all of it trying to fill the hole inside himself. Finally broke and suriviving on odd jobs, he found himself in Melvaunt, where he first. . . heard a strange call. Purposeless, it beckoned him with an offer of just that. His inborn psionics were perhaps what made him so sensitive to it, but they would also have allowed him to resist it. Perhaps, though, he had been happier working as his family had directed him, those long years ago, and the independence he'd been driven to seek had certainly brought him nothing but grief. . .
			.   The most dubious bit of that is the Phrenic template:
			https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/monsters/phrenicCreature.htm
			.   It's LA +2 and grants mental attribute bonuses and Psi-Like Abilities. Probably not too egregious, but templates are always something to run by the DM and this one has an additional caveat: "Similarly, creatures who advance by character class are usually not phrenic creatures—they simply take levels in a psionic class to hone their mental powers." That's not a _strict_ prohibition, but definitely something I'd want you to OK. It _does_ seem to fit a "naturally psionic, but repressed the powers, rather than embracing and formally developing them" concept. I like the story of that quite a lot, and how it plays off Edric's full-throated embrace of psionics.
			.   The other dubious bit is using one of the older age categories, which is often abused. I think it fits the story I have here in mind quite well, though, particularly as I try to explain _why_ someone is receptive to a thrallherd's call. This guy looking for a new purpose after a mid/late-life crisis suits it well. Looking for skill bonuses from the resulting attribute changes also dramatically limits the potential for abuse, as opposed to the impact of age categories on full spellcasting classes.
		-What level was he when he reached each age category? It affects skill points.
			-(So does being Human.)
			-Int by level:
				1-3		17
				4-7		19	(Middle age)
				8-11	20	
				12-13	22	(Old Age)
		-Skills: (4+2)*10+4*11+4*12+2*13=178
		-Feats: 6
			-Able Learner (Races of Destiny pg. 150)
			-Negotiator
				-+2 to Diplomacy and Sense Motive
			-Business Savvy (DMG II pg. 184)

4/23/21:
	-Our session began shortly after our Correspondence with Ran.
	-Moments later, I felt a chilly touch on my very soul, and received a vision.
		-I saw a contract, the one we just signed splitting the mine. It then burst into bright
		 flame, but did not burn.
		-I then saw a devil, a pit fiend, who claimed my "friend" had bargained away a portion of
		 my soul in exchange for a staff.
			-Presumably Ran and The Staff of the Planes.
		-I refused, saying none had any such authority. It claimed I'd signed a contract, but I
		 refuted that lie, and made an impressive Will save roll.
		-With that, I felt darkness release me.
	-Afterwards, I was unable to contact Ran, even with Correspondence.
	-We rushed back to the site of the debate and, teleporting into the office of the Janni running
	 the debate, finding Ran dead, mauled, presumably by the pit fiend standing over him.
		-It stood in front of a gate opened to The Nine Hells.
		-Beansinger, Dog, and Jaxx, affected by the fiend's fear and ran for the office door,
		 prompting attacks of opportunity from the fient's steel devil henchmen.
		-Enilias managed to calm things a bit an parley, though.
			-In the calm, we saw it holding the staff, now drained, presumably to open the gate.
			-Defusing the situation seemed to be on the table, but the fiend demanded an
			 unspecified large favor in return.
				-I, at least, and several others, were unwilling to take that, though Enilias
				 seemed open to it.
				-I began casting, and we were back to it.
				-The fiend managed to Hold a few of us, but I cast Temporal Acceleration, summoned
				 a few constructs, and shifted all save Enilias and Liliana back to The Material.
		-From there, we regrouped at Xûl-Jarak, then shifted to Elysium, to speak with our employer.
			-We informed them of our success in sharing the mine, but also in the less welcome news,
			 that the mine was being fought over by Demons and Devils.
			-We also accessed for help resurrecting Ran, but learned his soul was spoken for.
				-Many devils apparently fought over it, but it was claimed by the god of death,
				 Kelemvor.
					-I know him to be a LN greater diety.
					-We learned all this from our celestial hosts, and from divine revelation on
					 Jaxx's part (apparently he's on very good terms with his god).
				-(Sounds like Lesley is rolling a new character, a Mystic Theurge.)
			-They were able to reach the Mechanus faction, in mourning for Xin-Omega.
				-We gave them the same news, and they were, in turn able to reach the Xorns to do
				 the same.
			-The mercane would then be the only one among our troops we've not rallied.
				-Liliana lacked the spell slots today, but perhaps scrying tomorrow?
	-With that, we bedded down for the night in Elsyium.
		-More campfire questions:
			-Enilias means to eventually settle down running a casino at Xûl-Jarak.
			-Beansinger apparently knows a funeral bongo song.
			-I don't know what we could have done differently with our recent disaster, though
			 there _must_ have been something we overlooked, something we could have prepared.
			-Liliana always welcomed here in-born sorcerous talent, ever since she discovered it
			 as a child.
			-Dog's fearlessness was not taught, and we well loves the excitement of our lives.
			-Jaxx is deeply saddened to have gotten to participate so little in the fight with the
			 fiend. He's unsure what happened. At the sight of the fiend he wanted nothing but to
			 flee (this has _never_ happened to me before. . .).


-TODO:
	-Update your Roll20 sheet!
		-Done for your current level (20)


5/7/21:
	-We're introducing Lesley's new character, Nkisi, and shroudedstriker's character and cohort.
	-Gavin and Haravak arrived in Elsyium shortly after we awoke with shroudedstriker's Bard,
	 Shawn Ironside, and his cohort, the Wizard Shaggy.
		-With Shaggy's assistance, they'd come to Elsyium to warn us that Xûl-Jarak was in danger!
		-Apparently bands of werewolves had been seen, and some nearby village massacred.
		-Gavin had also received word of some wizard who may be spreading this particularly virulent
		 strain of lycanthropy
		-We of course shifted back to The Material to defend the fort.
	-Upon arrival, in the throne room, we could immediately hear the sounds of battle, the fortress
	 already under assault by werewolves.
		-In all the tumolt, it took me a moment to notice that the other half of the party (two Plane
		 Shifts had been necessary to accomodate the group) had picked up a strange looking human
		 attended by several ghosts, which he immediately sent out to join the battle, passing right
		 through the fortress's walls.
			-(That'd be Lesley's Nkisi.)
		-I quickly Accelerated, running up to the ramparts, summoning a trio of constructs, and then
		 dissolving into shadow (lest I contract lycanthropy).
			-The beasts stood up admirably to a beating by three constructs, which boded poorly for
			 us, so I quickly followed that with another batch.
			-My shadowy form did indeed prove to be lycanthropy proof, though (found out the hard way).
		-Holy crap. Dragonfire Inspiration is a wonderful complement to the constructs. With Shawn's
		 help, the constructs quickly broke the werewolves on the walls, with the party having wiped
		 out the ones in the courtyard and several on the walls.
		-I sent the constructs to pursue those who fled, with Liliana sending a few meteors after
		 them as well.
	-With the battle settled, we quickly saw to the wounded.
		-Dog, wise as ever, asked if the wounded would not turn into werewolves. Jaxx, skilled in
		 healing, examined them and confirmed they would. . .
		-Nkisi advocated (hard) for putting them out of their misery.
			-And again, in answer to every problem, at every opportunity. . .
		-A few of us knew, though, that Remove Disease could heal them, so we reached out to Thranton
		 with Correspond, as he had apparently fled to Sigil to "meet with a supplier".
			-He returned with a set of the scrolls.
	-Among the dead werewolves, now reverted to their former forms, we saw they were mostly
	 barbarians, with 3 among them having been of Dog's Onyx Tribe.
	-I (telepathically) nudged Enilias, suggesting he might want to speak to the troops.
		-One rousing speech later, and they were back in high spirits.
		-I proposed we feast in the tavern, Creating a variety of libations for those not on duty,
		 and more for those on watch, for when it ends.
	-As Nkisi hung around, the area began to grow cold. . .
		-Through a mix of arcane sight and talking with Nkisi, it was clearly emananting from him.
		-Apparently Nkisi is from the tortured lands. Whether a legacy of those ancient magical
		 scars or of the lich his tribe battled, cold now haunts him, and miles surrounding him.
		-Given that, the rest of us were less than enthused by him residing at the fortress as a
		 result of that. . .
		-As such, several of us rode North from the fortress, on astral steeds, into the swamps
		 5 miles from the fort, to find Nkisi a suitable home.
		-Edric, at Nkisi's request, carved an elaborate miniature castle from a block of "blue ice"
		 he provided.
		-Nkisi then turned that into an _actual_ ice castle, which is pretty sweet.
		-He did opt to have many of his ghosts stay with us at the fort, as new scouts and guards.
	-We talked through our projects for the near term:
		-The mine:
			-We have roughly 2 days while the planar forces muster.
			-Nkisi also volunteered his "family", which Jaxx tells me is, in fact, an undead army.
				-Seems useful, albeit somewhat difficult to get to another plane.
		-The werewolves:
			-With more time, I questioned Gavin about his mention of someone _spreading_ they
			 shapeshifter's disease. He spoke of a rumored prisoner of war camp, where prisoners
			 were infected and their blood drained, for use in spreading the illness.
			-Sadly, it sounds like they're only cureable for the first couple of days after
			 infection. . .
				-Sounds like it's the bloody cure, then.
		-The disposition of Ran's soul:
			-Nkisi is keen to look into this, and I do feel we owe Ran.


TODO:
	-Figure out with Jake if we manage to track down any info on the werewolves before we're due at
	 the mine.


5/21/21:
	-Wracking our brains for releveant-to-werewolves knowledge, we knew:
		-They're associated with the 300 year ago "Year of Wild Magic". Lycanthropy is believed to
		 have originated then, as a result of the arcane chaos.
			-The diety Malar ascended to godhood in that period. He's CE and associated with evil
			 lycanthropes.
		-We'd also heard of some "black blood" variety, that resembled our problem.
	-Examining the still-enchanted corpses with his enchanted-by-Ran eyes, Dog actually noticed
	 some common. . . resonance between the enchanted skulls Ran left behind and the corpses.
		-Perhaps this is (was) Ran's work?
	-Nkisi spoke with one of the formerly-a-werewolf corpses.
		-Apparently his holy symbol is his mother's skull. . .
		-Who sent you to Xûl-Jarak?
			-The Emissary of the Eternal Cycle.
		-Who is The Emissary of the Eternal Cycle?
			-Our leader, who sees to our happiness and daily needs. He provides us with sun drops.
				-"Sun drops" are a street name for the drugs that jackass tried to smuggle on the
				 boat we took to the capital a while back.
		-Where can I find The Emissary of the Eternal Cycle?
			-He is all around, and moves constantly.
		-Why do you wish to attack Melvaunt?
			-The Emissary told us to.
		-Why do attack The Brotherhood of Xûl-Jarak?
			-It is a stronghold in the area. We must destroy it's old centers of power to bring
			 about renewal through destruction.
		-How did you become a werewolf?
			-It was a ritual, a great honor, for servants of The Emissary.
		-Where else were you told to attack?
			-Any where that was strong, bringing glory to The Emissary.
	-Nkisi also tried communing with his diety:
		1 is the emissary of the eternal cycle within 50 miles of xul jarak?
			No
		2 is the emissary of the eternal cycle within 50 miles of ilinvur?
			No
		3 is the Emissary of the eternal cycle within 50 miles of melvaunt?
			No
		4 Is the emissary of the eternal cycle a living being?
			Living is a stretch.
		5 Is the emissary of the eternal cycle a god?
			To a degree.
		6 is the emissary on this plane?
			In a sense.
		7 does the emissary exist within the werewolf curse?
			Yes, but not entirely.
		8 can the emissary be killed?
			Not by mortals.
		9 is there a way to break the emissary's curse?
			We believe so.
		10 is there a way, other than death, for us to surpass our mortality and slay the emissary?
			Ascend.
		11 do we require anything special to ascend?
			Yes.
		12 is the special requirement on this plane?
			Not always.
		13 is the requirement an item?
			No
		14 is the requirement a ritual?
			Yes
	-Nkisi rolled a 42 on Knowledge(Religion)
		-Time is a sphere, expanding forward and back, depending on your divine rank.
			-The colloquial name for this cosmos is The Time Vault.
		-The ritual of ascension binds you to a plane, and to divinity.
		-To bind yourself to an existing will meaning battling the god so bound.
			-And, where planes overlap, is where the gods conflict and do battle.
		-_All_ planes must apparently be bound to someone in such a fashion.
			-In fact, questioning Jake now, the planes I create are linked to me in some small
			 fashion.
		-I contributed some Knowledge(The Planes):
			-There are said to be ways to change the spheres of planes.
		-Draconia is out there, though bound to who knows what.
			-The dracolich there served Cyric. . .
			-We also knew of the mind flayer involved in creating the puzzles. Perhaps the plane
			 as well.
		-I can also contribute _planes_.
			-One for all, or one for each?
				-According to Jake, in sharing a plane, our domains would need to align, or otherwise
				 be explained.
					-Tensions in the arrangement could lead to monkey-paw outcomes.
			-Jake mentioned that, spending _additional_ XP towards Genesis can confer additional divine
			 rank.
				-Perhaps something can be worked out to all pay towards this together, a joint binding
				 in a divine brotherhood?
				-It will require a focus, iconic to you (us?), where the essence (XP) is contributed.
					-Perhaps even more later, to advance in divine rank?
		-We should definitely begin research into this ritual.
			-It sounds like it's our next step with the werewolves anyways.
			-Jake mentioned Spellcraft would be involved, and likely Psicraft as well, especially
			 with me providing the Genesis.
			-Sigil is a solid option for libraries and the like.
				-Enilias has heard of political unrest in Melvaunt he wants to look in on, perhaps
				 even tied to the werewolves.
				-Perhaps those with Spell/Psicraft go do research while the others address that?
	-Half the party headed off to Melvaunt, while everyone with Spell/Psicraft, save Liliana for
	 ferrying the other half about, went to a library in Sigil that Shawn knew of.
		-It was festooned with statues of the various gods.
		-With the help of an attendant, we found the (large) section dedicated to the planes.
		-Through the use of Locate Object, Nkisi located a promising, but troublesomely intangible
		 and inconstant book. He had specifically sought a book containing a ritual of ascension.
			-Portions the text swirled and changed, while it frequently became half ethereal or
			 some such.
			-With Mind Blank, though, I was able to read it.
			-It did indeed detail a ritual of ascension, but one that required the sacrifice of
			 wealth and personal standing, a perfect humbling.
				-Zero gold to your name.
			-It also mentioned an opposite one, one calling for perfect glory instead.
				-A perfect victory on the plane to which you are to bound.
					-Jake mentioned "expending no non-renewable resource".
			-It also offered enough description of the components of these rituals to work through
			 one of our own.
			-Imperfection during the process may have grave consequences, though.
				-Jake later clarified that "states of being" affecting you during the ritual may
				 affect the outcome.
					-He gave the example of Conor's rage or the like, resulting in constant rage.
					-Psionic powers affecting you may have interesting impacts. . .
	-Dusk had come by that point in our research, so I Corresponded with Enilias:
		-The texts: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/845478519013376010
		-In short, Leiyraghon alledges Nather is responsible for the wolves.
			-They blame the war in The Ride is what provoked the ire of a god of the wilderness.
				-Or perhaps more directly caused the werewolves?
				-Hints from both Leiyraghon and Nkisi recollection of his last meeting with Ran
				 suggest he might have been involved. . .
			-We're leaning towards stringing Leiyraghon along, using their resources to fend off
			 and investigate the werewolves, but ultimately remaining loyal to Nather.
			-Enilias is going to aim to communicate this plan to House Nather, lest our actions be
			 misinterpreted. . .


TODO:
	-Come up with how you'll achieve your ritual and perfection, tied to one of your domains.
		-A perfect creation?
		-Custom domains are on the table. A crystal domain?
			-Might be cool, but probably not worth the effort given that good ones for you already
			 exist.
		-This will also gate epic levels, probably ruling out using your epic power as your perfect
		 creation.
			 -Well, you _do_ now have more than enough XP to reach 21. Can you do all three things
			  at once some how?
				-210,000 to reach 21, thus 7,350 to play with.
				-You and gods both do generally seem to be unmoored in time. . .
				-DC calc (heavily based on Origin of Species):
					Seeds (if Fortify is needed): 21+27+17
					Ad-hoc X for weird psicrystal and powerstone properties.
					Permanent is x5.
					So: (21+27+17+ X)*5 = 325 + 5X
					Mitigating options:
						-42	 42d6 backlash (eh, might be too much if you can't spend PP to prevent(vigor!))
						-220 for casting time of 100 days, 10 minutes.
						-25 for your planned followers ritual contributiosn
						(Maybe can also argue for the -5 for specialist school, but didn't factor that in.)
					So: 38 + 5X DC, for an XP cost of 13,680 + 1800X
					XP spend is probably necessary to bring that down to a lower DC.
						-Every 100 spent at casting even saves 360 during development, making it _very_
						 worthwhile for this spell you hopefully cast once.
							-3,800 spent would negate the fixed amount, and another 500X would eliminate
							 the rest.
								-So, X of more than 4 would consume more XP than I have for this
								 right now. . .
						-More ritual casters would help this too.
							-Each -1 to the DC saves 360 XP and 9,000 gp.
							-Convince other Elans to help?
			-So, doesn't sound like it's a possible option with the XP and ritual casters you
			 necessarily have available during this ascension.
				-It _is_, though, probably possible fairly soon thereafter, likely for less XP than
				 the +5 to Int.
		-So what's a perfect creation?
			-Maybe just what you manage with very high skill checks?
			-An elaborate crystal orrery and calculating engine, representing the planes you're
			 creating? Neatly integrates Artiface, Earth, and Mind.
				-Or simply _the planes themselves_?
		-Possible Edric domains:
			https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Artifice_Domain
			https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Earth_Domain
			https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Mind_Domain
			Earth Domain would be thematic-ish and get you access to Divine Earth Mastery.
				-DaD pg. 39. Burrow speed, Tremorsense, AC bonuses, _and can make dirt into gold._
				-https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Earth_Domain
				-Maybe use the Extra Domain salient divine ability to get this?
					-Requires Divine Rank 6, though. Threshold of Lesser Diety, so could get both
					 at once, due to bonus recieved at the new diety class.
				-Or replace Creation with it, but it's tough to give up.	
					-https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Creation_Domain
					-And it gives some decent at-will-for-you Domain spells.
					-Earth would probably be better, though, and can represent a heavy dose of
					 crystal theming.
					-Yeah, do it.
		-Raised the stuff I've thought of to date with Jake here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/846865630817026068
			-Raised domains, the divinity process, and creating the planes.
			-Seems like the whole thing is generally approved.


6/4/21:
	-Those of us in Sigil wrapped up our research.
		-We'd learned about as much as we could at the library, and left knowing that we need to
		 construct rituals of divine perfection to achieve our divinities.
	-I reached out to Enilias via Correspond, and let him know we're on our way back to Xûl-Jarak,
	 and to meet us there.
		-He agreed.
	-Once there, he caught us up on the chaos in Melvaunt.
		-Many noble families have secluded themselves in their estates.
		-We reviewed the general plan from last time, and all seem happy with.
		-Enilias also revealed that House Leiyraghon had been hinting they have connections to an
		 "ancient power".
			-Shaggy, with some help from my psicrystal, knew enough history to know they once had
			 a connection to House Dinoryn, a _drow_ noble family of The Underdark.
	-I also relayed what I'd uncovered about the process of gaining divinity.
		-Everyone seemed generally on board with my idea of conflux of planes.
	-The creation of a plane will take a week at least, so we'll not be completing any of the
	 divinity rituals before addressing the diamond mine. As such, we turned our attention to that.
		-I reached out to the Xorn delegate with Correspond.
			-We wanted meet up with them in advance of the battle, to more easily scry the mine
			 from the same plane as it.
			-It reported some difficulties with that plan, namely strangely shifting tunnels.
				-Perhaps a result of the demonic invasion.
			-Nonetheless, it gave us planar coordinates for their current camp, and the name of
			 one of their diggers to Scry as they themselves scout forward towards the mine.
		-We'll join them in the morning, after some rest and resupply.
		-Scrying that Xorn digger, we not only saw strange shifts in the earth, but also horrid
		 transmogrifications of the earth into slime and eyes.
			-The great eye was apparently an "eye of chaos", as those of us knowlegable about the
			 planes knew, a chaotic manifestation of the presence of some greater demon.
				-It can cause various random spell effects in it's vicinity, and a zone of wild
				 magic.
	-We then rested.
	-The next morning, we did some resupply with Thranton, then teleported to Steelhammer, in search
	 of zinc to craft planeshift foci.
		-Our favorite dwarven metals merchant was able to meet our needs, and I Fabricated foci for
		 The Elemental Plane of Earth for everyone who can manage Plane Shift.
	-We then shifted to the elemental plane, and teleported to our coordinates.
		-We were immediately beset by wild magic effects.
		-My strong-willed self resisted the effects, but Beansinger suddenly disappeared and Jaxx
		 was weirdly _pulled_ off to the South somewhere out of sight.
			-Shawn experienced the same as Jaxx, actually, shunted up into the ceiling above.
		-We recovered Shawn, whose Persistent Blink spell helped him clip out of the ceiling.
		-We then set about trying to locate the unfortunately Mind Blanked Jaxx.
		-Wild magic led to a number of mishaps. This place is dangerous for us.
		-Eventually, Shaggy managed to get Discern Location working, targetting _Jaxx's axe_, and
		 we telported to him.
			-He had apparently slain a chaos beast in the meantime.
		-Beansinger should have proved easier to find, but the wild magic was a bitch.
		-Eventually, Shaggy managed to summon a large earth elemental, that found a neighboring
		 tunnel harboring both our gnome and a Xorn digger.
		-Reunited, the Xorn was also able to lead us to "great evil", which appeared to be powerful
		 demons and devils duking it out.
		-About that time the general chaos had another go at us, after an hour or so of us dwelling
		 amongst it, and this time I ended up shunted to another tunnel myself.
			-I reached out to Beansinger via Correspond, and also determined my own location with
			 another power, enabling the rest of the party to teleport to me.
			-We're pretty eager to return to Xûl-Jarak, but we're also finally outside the wild
			 magic zone, so we paused to finally cast those Scry spells.
				-Shaggy witnessed:
					-Chaos Beasts vs Pit Fiend
					-Retagassi
					-A Bulezau (goat demon)
					-A Nalfeshnee (winged thing)
					-A Balor wielding a vorpal blade.


7/2/21:
	-Back at the fort, we discussed the fiasco at the mines and options for avoiding the wild magic
	 effect that the demons brought with them.
	-After resting, we opted to research how the devils manage it, and set out the next morning for
	 Sigil, and the library there we'd previously researched divinity.
		-After some reading, it seemed the devils can sign a pact with Mephistopheles, using a
		 specific artifact, The Bloody Pen of The Pact, with which The Pact Primordial was signed,
		 the ancient pact from which the devils were born.
			-Anything signed in blood with the pen is written into the very laws of the universe.
		-The Celestial-blooded are also immune to the effect.
		-Some ritual magic can also help avoid the effect, but it all seemed to also require the
		 assent or backing of a deity.
		-Most of us weren't too keen on swearing any oaths to the powers or the like, so I think
		 we're leaning more towards careful prep and swift assault.
			-Well, actually, Jaxx seems to be in good with Corellon Larethian and, after communing
			 with his god, the Creator of Elves protected _his children_ from the effect, though
			 not the rest of us.
			-Ah, and Nkisi was all in favor of a blood transfusion with a Celestial, making a deal
			 with a Hound Archon while we weren't around.
				-Seemed successful enough that Shawn and Shaggy opted to replicate the feat.
			-I, meanwhile, opted to finally put together my deep crystal crossbow, and rely on that
			 over powers.
				-I. . . was pretty skeptical of what the transfusion might do to my aberrant 
				 physiology.
		-Nkisi also purchase a scroll of Gate from Thranton, to bring his followers along for the fun.
			-Shawn can cast it with Use Magic Device, at least with some help from 2d6's buffs.
	-With all that prepped, we shifted to the Elemental Plane of Earth.
		-We were able to Teleport to the place we last saw the Xorns, but found nothing but the
		 occasional Xorn corpse.
			-Apparently their metabolism is fast enough for them to have starved in days, lost in
			 the shifting tunnels.
		-That was a good chunk of what Nkisi needed, though, as his cadaver golems were able to
		 incoporate the Xorn corpses, and gain a burrow speed.
		-With his ghosts scouting for us, and the golems tunneling, we made our way to where
		 Beansinger had caught sight of the archdemon or some such greater horror.
		-Soon, though, we ran into more chaos beasts.
			-They were fierce, but _are_ dead.
	-We're now about 150' from the diamond mine, or so ghosts told us, and will resume tunneling
	 there next session.


7/14/21:
	-We indeed resumed tunneling.
		-Thankfully, between ghosts and a spell Shaggy cast, Eye of Stone, we were able to avoid
		 intersecting with a tunnel full of chaos beasts.
		-Shaggy also got some prodigious earth moving power from the spell Undermaster.
		-Our ghostly scouts were able to identify a big group of demons, some groups of wounded
		 devils elsewhere, and also a deserted, temple-like structure.
	-We opted to investigate the temple, and tunneled towards it.
		-It appeared to be an ancient Xornish site.
		-Runes in an ancient dialect of Terran spoke of a "Prime Earth Elemental", the first of their
		 kind, and even seemed to describe an epic spell to summon it.
			-Well worth coming back to, or perhaps recording, when magic is a bit more reliable for
			 all of us.
	-The devils seemed to be generally on the run, but it was the demons and the resulting magical
	 chaos the deeply concerned us, so we decided to make sure the continued to provide a distraction
	 for the demons.
		-We sought to create tunnels linking two groups of wounded devils, to help them rally.
		-Nkisi's now-part-Xornish stitched golems and ghosts ended up in an engagement with some of
		 the demons.
		-The devils did indeed come to join the melee, though, drawing more demons forward, away from
		 their Balor leader. Mission accomplished!
	-With the battle joined again, we made another tunnel, arcing up and over the existing tunnels,
	 heading straight to where the Balor was commanding his troops from.
		-We burst through the wall and the battle was joined.
		-The Balor was fierce, but we focused our attack on it and Dog eventually felled it with a
		 mighty axe blow.
		-We learned the hard way, though, about the destructive death throws of a Balor. As it fell,
		 it exploded in a burst of light searing light, even slaying Liliana, Nkisi, Beansinger, and
		 Shaggy.
	-With the demon lord dead, I got us the hell out of there, the corpses of our companions in our
	 arms.
	-We shifted to Elysium, to report back to our client and to seek the aid of their healers.
		-They were able to (True) resurrect our companions, at an at least less than customary fee,
		 taken out of their rewards' value.
		-We let them know that the leader of the demons, and the source of the wild magic at the mine,
		 had been slain by our hands, and that the armies could now move in.
	-With that, our task was done, and we were left to rest a while in heaven.
		-Within a few days, the mine was under the control of our coalition, and we were granted our
		 rewards.
		-We chose to place the pool of the waters of Oceanus in a font on one of the walls of
		 Xûl-Jarak dungeon level 2.


7/30/21:
	-We sat in Elsyium, and discussed divinity.
	-In the course of that, Shawn revealed he had a wonderous bedroll, one that others might find
	 interesting and would speed my work with the planes.
		-He was very right, and we rather hastily returned to Xûl-Jarak, to speak with Thranton,
		 who indeed kept Heward's design in stock.
	-In our tavern, where we found Thranton, we also noticed a rather remarkable visitor, an old
	 man with seven yellow canaries, perched about his body.
		-I was preoccupied, and hustled to Thranton, with my companions following.
		-After both business and a wonderous feast, curtesy of Nkisi's magics, I finally took more
		 notice of the man.
			-My companions were as preoccupied as I, once the food appeared.
		-The canaries, though, sparked a dim recollection for me, some mention I'd heard of them.
		 Perhaps some sign or portent known to take their form?
		-A facility with wildlife alone was of interest to me, though, given the near creation of
		 our initially lifeless planes.
		-As such, I asked my companions, did any of them know this man?
		-Talking it over with them, none personally knew him, but we, especially the erudite-in-
		 matters-of-religion Shaggy, knew the signs. This man was no less than Bahamut, the draconic
		 god of justice!
			-The canaries were, in fact, said to be seven ancient gold dragons.
		-Shawn being a follower of his, he approached the god with awe and reverence, but nonetheless
		 determined to go over and strike up a conversation! Bold!
		-It would seem he indeed knew his god well, though, as he was more than happy to converse,
		 interrogating us as to our motives, philosophies, and goals.
			-He confirmed that the threat behind the werewolves was indeed divine, but confessed he
			 was. . . unwilling to help (though seemed perhaps instead to be some way bound not to,
			 or at least simply too busy).
			-He also seemed pretty down on the leadership of Melvaunt, hinting pretty hard he'd
			 not be unhappy to see some regime change.
			-Shawn also asked Bahamut's aid in his quest, divinity-enabled werewolf stomping.
				-He was unwilling (or unable) to simply _grant_ Shawn divinity, but did grant him
				 a powerful protective blessing.
		-Eventually, he took his leave of us, walking out of the tavern.
	-After that rather profound encounter, we set about our soon-to-be-divine work, and will be
	 opening next session with the completion of the divinity rituals.


8/19/21:
	-It was now time to begin the creation of the planes.
		-I shifted to the Astral Plane, and, at the point overlapping the very center of Xûl-Jarak,
		 I began my casting.
		-I brought a batch of Nikisi's ghosts with me, and Nikisi himself ferried more of them over
		 with repeated castings of Plane Shift.
	-I began with my own plane.
		-The plane had been carefully designed, nested spheres of earth and stone, interlinked with
		 great crystal pillars with holes leading from one sphere to another. Gravity on the plane
		 would point to the nearest of these spheres or pillars, providing useful surfaces on either
		 side of the sphere and allowing navigation up the pillars and through the hills.
		-Needless to say, the plane is strongly earth-aligned, and water will ever seek to intrude
		 into it's opposite. It is only through careful design of the metaphysical structure of the
		 plane that I was able to keep it out (basically, Knowledge(The Planes) and Concentration
		 checks).
	-With the aid of the bedrolls, I was able to accomplish work towards two castings of Genesis
	 each day, and so I also began the creation of Nikisi's plane.
		-It was to be a barren, windswept moor, bounded in walls of indesctructible ice.
		-A few hours in, shockingly, flowers began to sprout from the gray astral medium.
			-Perhaps a reaction to the nature of Nikisi's cold plane of the unliving? Another
			 intrusion by an opposite force?
		-Having to dedicate most of my concentration to the manifesting, I asked Dog to investigate.
			-He smelled them. They smelled like flowers.
			-The _did_ seem to slowly sway, back an forth, in sync with one another.
			-He stomped on one, seemingly killing it, only for it to sprout back shortly.
			-Urinating on them seemed to have no effect at all, so he resorted to uprooting one.
				-_That_ yielded some strangeness, as the uprooted flower sprouted legs and began
				 marching up Dog's arm.
				-He quickly tossed it to the ground, where it rooted itself again.
			-I suggested the it may be another opposite intruding, a symptom of being able to create
			 only two planes at once, and lacking all that will eventually balance Nikisi's cold,
			 dead plane.
				-Perhaps meeting this strange life with it's opposite would salve the flaw until
				 the whole structure could be created. Suggesting this, I looked to my ghostly
				 guards, and Farrow, Nikisi cohort, nodded, asking us to cover our ears.
				-He then let out a ghostly howl, at which the flowers crumbled and disintegrated
				 back into the ether.
			-That seemed to solve the problem, and the rest of the manifestation completed without
			 incident.
	-Back at Xûl-Jarak, Dog and I went to grab dinner in the tavern.
		-It was quite rowdy, with a vigorously festive atmosphere, a thing Beansinger did not help
		 as he immediately burst into a raucous song after walking in the door behind us.
		-I sat down at a table with Shawn, though, and suggested to him that this might be a result
		 of some kind of reaction to the plane creation, and perhaps something we should calm.
		-He was open to trying it and talked the crowd down a bit, calming things.
	-For next day of work, we shifted again to the Astral Plane and I began tending to my plane.
		-The first sign of trouble was when Dog said, "That's not good."
		-Questioning him, he told me he'd suddenly gone blind in his right eye.
		-Soon, he was tumbling about in the astral medium, flailing and yelling at invisible foes.
		-I asked my intelligent ioun stone to cast Detect Magic, and it reported an aura of illusion
		 magic seemingly plaguing Dog.
		-Eventually he seemed to get it under control, but only after picking me up, and me
		 questioning about it, did he suddenly seem to come to, the illusionary attacker gone
		 completely for him.
	-After a shift guiding my plane, I returned to work on Nikisi's plane.
		-As I worked, the area around us on the Astral Plane grew steadily warmer.
		-Sensing another reaction to the creation of Nikisi's plane, I Accelerated and created a
		 batch of constructs, with Energy Touch(Cold), and had them circle us, waving their frosted
		 hands about them.
		-That seemed to do the trick, abating the heat.
	-The next day, as I worked on my plane, the astral medium seemed to strangely. . . crack around
	 me.
		-"Be on your guard!" I shouted, "That's. . . not normal."
		-Dog reported auras of evocation around the cracks, and I Accelerated to do my own
		 investigation.
			-The cracks seemed like a kind of slow moving earthquake, a fitting response to my plane
			 of ordered earth, and they were gradually forming a larger fissure.
			-Within that fissure, a shadowy figure lay.
		-I reported this back to the others, and suggested that one of the ghosts, immaterial as
		 they are, investigate the fissure.
			-Farrow dispatched one and he reported the same shadoy figure, seemingly shifting in
			 size and form regularly.
		-Meanwhile, Dog, grabbing somehow the astral medium itself, attempted to hold the fissure
		 closed, with some success.
		-Eventually, we could hear a strange rumbling coming from the fissure, one possessed of
		 peaks and regular patterns, almost like speech. . .
			-A manifestation of Tongues, accomplished outside of time, allowed me _some_ sense of
			 the message, though the creature's thoughts seemed. . . confused, chaotic.
			-Still, I got a sense of. . . rust, and the dissolution of metal.
		-Farrow attempted to dispel the phenomena, which seemed to shrink the fissure, but not
		 remove it entirely.
			-Still, that was our most successful attempt to resolve that matter yet.
			-Farrow also attempted a shadow magic spell of some kind, briefly trapping the creature
			 within _it's_ shadow, a thing he said would buy us half a minute or so.
		-We then opted to call for backup, using one of the Sending skulls Dog had.
			-Shawn came well prepared, with a _Reaving_ Dispel, which allowed him to redirect the
			 spell he targetted. Recognizing what we were witnessing as the creation of an avatar,
			 he redirected the power to me, creating a minfestation of one of the domains of my
			 slowly rising divine power, which I channeled towards my affinity for artiface.
			-The end result resembled a crystalline, cubist Inspector Gadget, which set about
			 assisting me in the creation of my plane.
				-It doubled my progress.
	-The rest of the work on my plane proceeded without incident. In returning to Nikisi's plane,
	 though, the avatar needed a bit of a pep talk.
		-It could not understand this plane of death, when life eternal was within our powers.
		-The contrast, I explained, was important, an essential facet of a far larger perfection.
			-It felt as if the avatar had drifted a bit form myself, growing somewhat. . . wilder.
		-We debated the matter and, in the end, it seemed convinced, and suddenly more somber.
		-We returned to the work, and it showed a talent for sequestering the balancing energy
		 prompted by the creation of the plane in temporary pocket dimensions.
		-At the end of the day, the avatar grew less substantial, and eventually faded from
		 existence.
	-The rest of the work on these two planes proceeded uneventfully, in part because of me adopting
	 the avatar's energy sequestration technique.
		-Edric and Nikisi were then complete, on the 1st day of the 4th month of year 301 (After
		 Cataclysm).
	-As I returned the Xûl-Jarak on the final night, the planes wrested from the ether, Nikisi came
	 to collect Dog.
		-Apparently Dog had agreed to aid him in some ritual, undoubtedly of a grisly nature, given
		 the skinning knives he had Dog bring with. . .
		-Nikisi took Dog to his new plane.
		-When the two returned, Nikisi had indeed undergone a grisly transformation.
			-He now possessed a fleshless, skeletal face, a flayed body, and was draped in what
			 appeared to be his own skin.
			-He sure _looked_ like a death god.
	-While we marveled at his new form, one of our rangers ran up, commendably managing to find his
	 tongue within a minute of seeing Nikisi. When he spoke he asked us to follow him, quickly.
		-Leading us to the gate, we saw a forest stretching out before Xûl-Jarak, where once was
		 only a barren moor.
		-As we watched, a giant, horned man emerged from it, giving forth a booming laughter.
			-I shouted, "What's the joke, friend?"
			-The satyr-like figure announced that, "Death! Death is not divine, and not what defines
			 life! Vigor, joy, and debauchery, that is what a divine life is made of!"
			-With that, he disappeared, though the forest remained.
				-A valuable resource, that! I've long longed for some trees, but thought the stony
				 soil unsuited to them. Also, though I could have afforded to wait, I hardly mind
				 the instant growth.
				-That figure may be somewhat possessive of his trees, though. . .
		-That did not seem a bloody-minded werewolf god, but perhaps _some_ kind of god.
			-We speculated this may be a reaction to Nikisi's ascension.
	-The next day, I began work on Dog and Shawn's planes.
	-I began with Dog's.
		-He desired a battlefield and hunting ground, and we designed a river valley, bound my
		 infinitely high cliffs.
		-In the course of beginning the spell, Dog seemed to grow a bit sleepy.
		-Noticing it, he started, and started raging, yelling, "I don't want to go to sleep!"
		-He eventually seemed to shake off the (very unlike him) calm that had come over him.
	-I then moved onto Shawn's.
		-He had dreams of a beautiful college of adventuring, and we worked together to shape the
		 landscape into one providing gorgeous vistas, "natural" amphitheaters with wonderous
		 accoustics, and similar.
		-During the process, though, I received a Sending from Shaggy, saying the creation process
		 was leaking again, causing chaos back at the fort.
		-I replied that there was likely little I could do from here, and that they should attempt
		 to calm things.
		-By the time I'd completed this stage of the manifestation, it seemed they had succeeded in
		 that as, upon my return to the fort, there were signs of conflict and strife, but things
		 were calm.
	-We left off there, with more plane crafting ahead of us.


8/27/21:
	-(Lesley and Shroud had to miss this session.)
	-We returned the following day to work on Dog's plane, followed by (owing to Shroud being gone)
	 work on Jaxx's.
		-A short while into work on Dog's, he and Jaxx bizarrely began to remove their armor.
			-I asked Dog what was going on (he having begun first), and he claimed to be hot.
		-Their weapons also to hang heavy in their hands. Something more seemed to be going on than
		 Dog admitted.
		-Dog asked one of the ghosts if he could see what he was seeing, and indeed my ioun stone
		 sense strange flows of magic between the planar nexus and Dog and Jaxx.
		-The ghost volunteered to inspect Dog from the inside and Dog, with characteristic boldness
		 consented.
		-After emerging from Dog's body, the ghost spoke of a weakness connected to the planes.
		-Dog and Jaxx reasonably (?) began to benchpress each other, looking to prove something.
		-That seemed to be effective, as. . . shadows emerged from Dog and Jaxx.
		-"Follow that ghost, ghost!" Dog shouted, and, after a tussle and a shout from the ghost,
		 the vague shadows crumbled.
		-After completing a shift on Dog's plane, I began Jaxx's.
			-He desired a natural amphitheater, to eventually be his colliseum, surrounded by jungle.
			-I was able to manage the first with Genesis, but reported that life was beyond my powers.
			-Jaxx claimed, though, to know many druids, a thing I told him we should talk more about,
			 given that most of us will likely desire their aid in adding life.
			-As such, I just took care to ensure a careful balance of silicates and trace minerals in
			 the earth of the plane to facilitate their eventual work.
		-Jaxx's seemed to go more smoothly, though there were. . . blips in the forming plane.
			-A formidable Knowledge(The Planes) check suggested that The Astral Plane may lack the
			 matter required for the reaction to Jaxx's plane, and that perhaps we should look
			 elsewhere. . .
			-Jaxx eventually received a sending from Liliana, back at Xûl-Jarak.
			-Sounded like there was some chaos there. Since it sounded like a reaction to one of
			 his domains, he counciled (non-lethal) blunt force trauma as the solution.
	-With the days work completed, we returned to Xûl-Jarak, and I sought out Enilias to ask him
	 about the. . . reaction.
		-Apparently there'd been some soldiers and werewolves, some distance from the fort, who went
		 from battling one another to a free-for-all melee, one that gradually moved towards the fort.
		-Liliana took care of them all, leaving a few smoking craters outside the fort, but the
		 madness began to affect our own troops as well, so Enilias applied Jaxx's blunt solution to
		 them, knocking them out through now.
		-We discussed it and were unsure how to remedy the issue, but I reached out to to Nikisi, at
		 his ice fort, via Correspond, as it seemed a religious matter.
		-He suggested that great inspiration, or great fear, may be the appropriate remedy.
		-As they gradually came to, Enilias tried the inspiration route, but with no luck.
		-So Jaxx played bad cop, performing a convincing drill sergeant reoutine with Intimidation.
		-_That_ seemed to do the job.
		-We also discussed what is to come, how each of these event has seemed to be a reaction to
		 the domains of the eventual god to be, and what we may soon see.
	-The next day, I and several others returned to The Astral Plane, and to my working.
		-Continuing my work on Dog's plane, the astral medium slowly began to. . . furrow.
			-Eventually, plants began to sprout, perfectly spaced from one another.
			-I asked Dog, Beansinger, and Jaxx to do what they could to counter this energy leakage.
			-Jaxx began plucking the plants, while Dog began wildly hacking at them with his axe.
			-The plants, torn open, reeked or rot, and oozed black ichor.
			-Jaxx wished we had some flame and, the instant he'd said it, I was surrounded by
			 constructs with flaming fists.
			-Beansinger contributed some Grease as well, and soon the constructs had the plants all
			 aflame, and the furrows in the astral medium seemed to dissipate back into featureless
			 gray.
		-From there, it was back to work on Jaxx's.
			-It at least _seemed_ uneventful, though we did get a message from Enilias saying he was
			 heading to Melvaunt to take care of some urgent business.
	-Back at the fort, Enilias had returned already, and was in frantic action, organizing his
	 contacts and followers.
		-Apparently there'd been a hiccup in his own route to divinity: peace had broken out among
		 the nobles of Melvaunt.
			-It would seem that he's very much of the Baelish opinion, that chaos is a ladder.
		-He sought to scry the eldest son of House Leiyraghon, to which I contributed a (minor)
		 created likeness of the jackass.
			-It would seem he's found some degree of redemption, in the service of a god of the same.
		-Enilias, with some aid from Nikisi and his possession-capable ghosts, set about creating a
		 fake assasination attempt, to wreck said peace.
	-That continued on into the next day, so Dog, Beansinger, Jaxx, and I all returned to The Astral
	 Plane, and I to work.
		-Several crises already averted, work on Dog's continued smoothly.
		-Word came from Enilias as well. Sounds like he was successful in his goals.
		-Returning then to work on Jaxx's, no crisis presented itself either. At least here. . .
	-Returning to Xûl-Jarak, things seemed calm as well.
		-Jaxx was less sure, though, and attempted an experiment, having two guards race eachother
		 for a purse of 10 gold.
		-The response he got, though, was, "Why would we want to do that? We're friends, and one
		 would lose."
		-Even a more absurd attempt ("First to touch his nose wins!") also failed. . .
		-This is a subtle, but nonetheless grave ill.
		-Mind Blanking one of them ("Here, let me reorder your mind. . .") saw _that_ one take off
		 at a run, but the others were still unwilling to take up the race.
		-Jaxx then tried a. . . more visceral form of competion, borrowing a skull from Dog and
		 summoning a trio Red Caps and setting them on the reluctant guards.
		-Two were nearly cut down, and lay bleeding until I healed them with my belt.
		-Afterwards, they seemed largely free of the malign (?) influence, and some more drill
		 sergeant routine from Jaxx got them all scrambling to prove themselves, with arm wrestling
		 and the like.
	-The remainder of the working went smooth from there, with Dog and Jaxx's planes completed the
	 8th day of the 4th month of year 301.
		-We opted to retcon the day we got done toward's Shawn's, to accomodate Shroud's absence,
		 and will just be saying the events related to that happened the next day, when I start in
		 on planes for Enilias and Shawn together.


9/8/21:
	-


TODO:
	-Power the fuck up!
		-Spending:
			-Level 20 XP is 190,000 and you've got 246,150.
			-Then you need to spend 6k on the planes (still haven't deducted any).
			-Leaves 50,150 to spend. Maybe more, if planar XP counts towards something.
				-Ah, it counts half, so you've actually got 53,150
			-Hmm. . . looks like all you'll be able to do is Divine Rank 1.
				-Lvl. 21 is 20k, and so DR 1 is supposed to be 40k.
				-For the DR, deduct the XP from your total, like an XP expenditure for a spell or
				 the like.


TODO:
	-Maybe buy other stuff?
		-Force Screen seems like an interesting power stone.
	-"Conflux X", or similar, as the name for our planar structure?
		-A nod to Xûl-Jarak, while (diplomatically, owing to Dog) distancing ourselves from it's
		 Orcish origins.
		-Further (in character as Edric), as an X is the meeting place, at a single point, of two
		 lines, so too shall we create 6 planes all meeting at a single point, forming a similar
		 structure in seven-dimensional space.
		-Alternately: "The X Conflux" "Confluence X"
		-Talked to Jake about the nature of the Conflux and it's creation here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/868986385053409321
		-Potential axises for such a structure:
			-Voice and Violence: Shawn and Enilias vs. Dog and Jaxx
			-Death and Magic(Song? Plain _Life_?): Nikisi vs. Shawn
			-Chaos and Law: _All_(?) vs. Me? All _bound_ harmoniously by me?
		-Jake's request for the divinity process: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/870717250565439529
			-In crafting his planar conflux from the ectoplasmic medium of The Astral Plane, Edric was, as in all things, careful and thorough, creating exhaustive plans. Increasingly unmoored in time as he is, he brought an impossibly diverse set of skills to the table. Revising the history of his life through the use of his Psychic Reformation power, he could arm himself with whatever skills were required at the moment, even those he'd never known, though mostly he used it to enhance his already formidable knowledge of engineering, geology, and, especially, the planes (OOC, I'm using the power to respec at least two levels to get Genesis, and then to replace it again with a combat power when done, for 200 XP, and can do a bunch of temporary skill changes along with that, or even more for more XP).
			-Edric focused his efforts on designing a stable and harmonious metaplanar structure, each plane suited to it's future god and each in careful relation to the others, according to the nature of said god. He considered their alignments and the many other qualities that defined their very beings, creating a seven-dimensional arrangement of the planes with such axes as voice and violence (Shawn and Enilias vs. Dog and Jaxx), calm and fury (Nkisi vs. Dog), and even a four-way elemental symmetry (Edric/Earth, Nkisi/Air, Dog/Fire, Shawn/Magic) (TODO: detail alignment stuff more?).
			-Each was to meet the others in one area, initially encompassing the entirety of the currently tiny planes, at which we'd agreed to eventually create our own overlapping Xûl-Jarak replicas, and, in fact, meeting The Material Plane as well, at the location of the true Xûl-Jarak. Each, though, was set to meet the others at many other, infinitismally small, points as well, further stabilizing the conflux. In this, Edric drew inspiration from the interlinked structure of the crystals so associated with his psionic art, though for more than just the rigid stability they possessed. Crystals, in their interconnectedness, also resemble another massively interconnected object: the living brain. Though the lesser points of overlap between the planes were to be minuscule, information is a thing without substance, and even the most infinitismal influence can bear it. As the planes grew and more connections formed, the conflux would also develop ever more routes to pass influence and information between itself, gradually developing a capacity for wonderous cognition, a capacity Edric eagerly anticipated the use of, just as he used crystals to expand his mind into other substrates.
			-In linking himself to his new plane, and through it to the whole of his wonderous new creation, Edric found divinity.
			(RESERVE BELOW FOR JAKE)
			-Of course, Edric knew that, as their creator, he could not help but be linked in at least some way to _each_ of the planes, even if he was not keen to advertise the fact. As such, his own plane, the first created, was designed as both hub and seed for the network. It could not be otherwise, given that some portion of the energies of the other planes flowed through him regardless. This would surely aid him in. . . tending to the whole of the structure over the millenia. Even perfection can eventually be marred, as a crystal may be chipped with sufficient force.
			-@DMJake#5594, I vaguely recall us discussing some portion of the XP expenditure on the planes maybe counting towards a divine rank, it being an investiture of XP into the very things that we'll be deriving divinity from, and it apparently also linking me to my creations in a way similar to the linkage between deities and planes anyways. Is that indeed something you'd like to to do? If so, any idea of the details?
	-Memorialize Ran in some fashion?
	-Sounds like we're not advancing to epic until some narrative event.
		-Good reason to be a bit more liberal in XP spend, like inherent ability bonuses or power
		 research, like Precise Plane Shift.
		-Well, we're there already, and it comes with _more_ reasons to spend XP on other stuff, like
		 divinity! That said, the inherent Int will eventually be very nice for high level Salient
		 Divine Abilities.
	-Adapt "Precise Plane Shift" to Psionics?
		-Search for it above.
	-Potential items:
		-Ioun Stones:
			-https://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#iounStones
			-Particularly exciting ones:
				-Dusty rose	Prism	+1 insight bonus to AC	5,000 gp
					-Eh, might conflict with Precognition, Defensive.
				-(DONE!) Pale green (+1 competence bonus on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks) 30,000 gp
				-Orange	Prism	(+1 caster level)	30,000 gp
					-I asked if I can apply it to psionics here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/762867099009548339
		-Maybe a mithral chainshirt, once 1,100 gp. becomes trivial
			-https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Mithral_Shirt
			-Helps a bit if your surprised, dispelled, or otherwise without your Inertial Armor
			-Only downsides are the 10 lb. weight and a (high) max dex bonus of +6 (hard to exceeed with your natural 16)
		-Tome of Clear Thought is your next Int upgrade
			-https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Tome_of_Clear_Thought
			-You probably want to hold out for the 137,500 gp. +5 one, though.
			-The same, but via NPC Wish casting from a 17th level wizard:
				5*(17*90+5*5000) = 132,650 (sort of cheaper, but a 5k is rounding error on this)
			-A 17th level Psion with Reality Revision would also work, but you yourself will have
			 delayed access to that, due to prestige class levels, and would probably want to avoid
			 spending your own XP anyways.
		-A Crystal Ball is attractive, now that you can channel through the psicrystal
			-The start at 42k: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Crystal_Ball
		-Power Stones could be useful: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/items/powerStones.htm
			-Particularly in light of the "Manifest an Unknown Power from Another’s Powers Known" bit of this: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/psionicPowersOverview.htm#manifestingPowers
				-Lets you manifest them yourself, without flushing the stone, but involves many Psicraft checks, as well as at least full round action before the actual (whatever) action of casting it
				-You've bought every remotely decent one through level 2, and every great one up to 5 or so.
			-They seem to be cheap:
				Power Level	Market Price1

									1st		25 gp
									2nd		150 gp
				96-100	06-65	—	3rd		375 gp
				—	66-95	01-05	4th		700 gp
				—	96-100	06-50	5th		1,125 gp
				—	—		51-70	6th		1,650 gp
				—	—		71-85	7th2	2,275 gp
				—	—		86-95	8th2	3,000 gp
				—	—		95-100	9th2	3,825 gp
			-You bought some of them. See 4/16/20.
		-Scrolls of Uncertain Provenance (8,000)?
			-https://holiviantales.wordpress.com/the-marketplace/scrolls-of-uncertain-provenance/
			-Slotless +5 competance to Knowledge skills with alignment restriction you meet
			-The relic stuff isn't accessible to you, or necessarily worth it.
		-Necklace of Natural Weapons for the constructs?
			-Savage Species pg. 58
			-Works like a magic weapon of whatever bonus and properties that applies to one or more natural weapons
			-Price is 600 + equivalent magic weapon cost, multiplied by number of natural weapons it can affect at once
				-So, for just the slam (or claws that replace it), is cheap, but secondary attacks would make it expensive
			-Long term because equiping them occupies a lot of the duration until it's boosted to a minute
		-Augment Crystals:
			-Lesser+ Aquatic Action
				-Grants a swim speed. Would be great if you get into ships.
				-1,000 for lesser, or 3,000 for greater, which adds:
					"You also take no penalties on attacks or movement while underwater (as if
					under the effect of freedom of movement) and you can breathe water as easily
					as air."
	-Permanent Tongues is starting to look attractive, at 500 XP via Incarnate
		-Hmm, that's also probably ~13k to just buy it
	-Stronghold
		-Fortify it!
		-Invite Matt & Mary back?
			-As NPCs, for one shots, play by email, etc.?
			-Work at / defend the fortress?
			-Here's my proposal to the current players, to be turned into an email to Matt & Mary if they're up for it:
				-https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/586968418851225675
			-Sent it
				-Never heard back
		-An old note says, "See email for details of surrounding area". Maybe search "Thar", or however you spell it?
		-While around, create food and booze with Minor Creation, for those working there
		-Repairs and construction
			-First the broken wall (4A)
				-Jake gave a cost estimate:
					-https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/585612732993372173
					-Confirm with him, but material cost for craft proucts is 1/3 in craft rules, and likely true of this
						-Nope! That is the 1/3 figure: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/586975815573438474
					-Also lets you calculate some stuff from labor cost of that, potentially
						-Compare it to laborer cost per day and you can figure out some time and staffing stuff from that
				-DONE
			-Then the broken keep wall (8)
				-DONE
			-Followed by hole in the throne room ceiling (14) and the walls it once supported (25-27)
			-With Fabricate unlocked, you may already be competant with this
				-For a mineral, it seems like caster level 8 allows you to create a 12' x 12' x 6" wall section per day
					-9*8/12*2
				-Overchannel lets you get 25% more output in exchange for healing (2 CL bumps starting from 8)
			-Smaller, easier stuff:
				-Create a springhouse in 31A, which already has flowing water
					-Bam, refrigerated storage
				-Fortified doorway/gatehouse between 38 and 39
					-Then, dig further fortifications into the rock along side it, maybe even in same Fabricate casting
					 (turning natural stone into the cut stone brick needed for gateway _and_ a cavity)
						-Arrow slits
						-An iron door costs 500 gp. in Stronghold Guide, so 166.67 worth of iron
							-Wait, screw it. That same source has a nearly-as-good stone door. Just do that for near zero cost
					-Other seal necessary is bars or stone lattice across water's path, maybe along with water wheel
				-Dig out 34 further
					-Might be loot, as well as just more finished-ish space
					-Would be a good use for our hired laborers, though we might want to be on hand for uncovered
					 traps and enemies
						-Oh, or utility constructs!
					-DONE
				-Discussed the above here: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/650063447228284929
		-Plant some stuff
			-Hemp for rope making
			-Trees (elans can afford to be patient)
	-Companion spirit from DMG II?
		-Brought it up again, 4/4/19
			-Renar was into the companion spirit, in particular
			-Raise the spirit again when we're all level 7, as that's the start of a new rank for it (may save cost)
	-Teamwork benefits from the same book/section?
		-Homebrew one?
			-Tumble based, granting free movement through allied spaces?
				-Maybe with some limit, if necessary, like skill checks or movement isn't free.
		-Joe lets us qualify for the flanking one
			-Talked about it in Discord here: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/668640303913238530
			-Now we just need two weeks of downtime to qualify
	-Research leyline travel
		-Your question about it: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/609931674968653845

		-Adalia is into it too. She might help.
		-This has gone much further! Look at notes above ("Gerard" would be a good search).
	-Furnace bellows plus poison container equals poison sprayer?
		-Summon cheap astral constructs by the handful and have them run in carrying these things
	-Cannons!
		-Stormwrack has stats.
		-Neat for ships and seiges, and maybe for Creation powers, but slow to load with some training
		 required.
			-Can you Create a _loaded_ gun? _Many_ loaded guns?
		-Homebrew improved versions:
			-Breech-loading swivel guns!
				-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breech-loading_swivel_gun
				-High rate of fire because of replaceable chambers you can fill with shot and powder
				 in advance.
				-Very much a feature of the late Medieval/Early Renaissance technology we seem to have.
					-Wiki page has a French example from 1410.
	-Was the Melvaunt (city with noble families) on a body of water?
		-If so, what was it?
			-Yes, and it leads to the ocean, though isn't the ocean itself
				-River or inlet
		-Is there potential to eventually sell ships to some faction associated with it?
			-Could be a good use of fabricate
			-Should have decent relations with one or more noble families, after returning the kids
		-Glister, the town the rebelled due to the succubus, has docks with ocean access too


-Long term TODO:


-TODONE:
	-Talk about starting an adventuring company?
		-Fits character:
			-Lawful
			-Oldest member of party, save sort of Renar
				-Spent much of that time adventuring
				-Has he been in one?
					-Yes
		-Benefits:
			-Some kind of shared property?
			-Reputation
		-Got lukewarm reception
		-Brought it up once more, on 5/2/19 and Elle was particularly enthusiastic
		-Everyone seems to be game
		-Figure out a name
			-The Brotherhood of Xûl-Jarak
	-Eventually setup some scouts/rangers
		-Haravak is our half-orc ranger buddy's name
		-DONE
	-A big Reformation at 12? (DONE)
		-All 12 levels would cost 600 XP
			-Looks like you need all but level 1, to replace minor creation at 2, so 550
			-Ah, no, you do want all of them. It's to change you skills, as you definitely would
				have had craft woodworking at 1, and may have _needed_ to, the way you spent skills
		-12 gives you a feat, so you can gain something temporary and then change it to Psicrystal
		 Containment during this
			-Probably a crafting feat, and likely Imprint Stone, for the next item benefits
		-Would give a chance to swap out your out-of-combat powers for other stuff, if you can replace
		 them with power stones
			-See what you can buy first (they're cheap anyways, but all the more reason to only spend gold)
			-You can craft those you can't buy
				-Figure out costs:
					-http://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/items/powerStones.htm
					-"Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp and 1/25 of the base price in XP."
			-Powers to replace:
				-Minor Creation (1)
					-Only 1 minute casting time, so leave it if you don't have a good replacement
					-Vigor (1)
						-Share Pain is 1 hour/level, and thus well suited to a crystal, but this
						 may need to be cast, or recast, in combat
				-Fabricate (4)
					-Ego Whip (2)
				-Divination (4)
					-Energy Bolt (3)
				-Major Creation (5)
					-10 minutes, so easily replaced
					-True Seeing, Psionic?
				-Fabricate, Greater (6)
					-Another good reason to do this at 12
					-Crafting is 825 gp. and 66 XP
				-Maybe Psychic Reformation itself? (4)
					-Not sure what the XP cost does to this all. Best case is it's 50 XP more expensive to buy/craft
					-Also leaves you maximally vulnerable to the theft of these crystals.
					-Concussion Blast (2)?
				-Cost to buy all but Reformation: 4200
					25+700*2+1125+1650
			-Confirmed with Jake that the above are all available, though largely require special order: https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/689996487064551479
			-Got all but Major Creation and Fabricate, Greater
		-Gives you 8 skill points, by removing Textile and Woodworking
	-Investigate that "enchanted spyglass" you used "To see that floating psionic temple"
		-It's still in your gear.
		-If it functions just fine as a regular spy glass, that's still a very handy (and expensive)
		 thing.
			-It does!
	-Purchase Plane Shift foci:
		-DONE
		-Forked metal rods, with different materials and sizes for each plane, as described here: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/planeShift.htm
		-Magic shop in Melvaunt should be able to help.
		-Alternately, research (Knowledge(The Planes)) plus crafting can likely solve the problem.
			-Perhaps try that first, to save cash. Use your book, or maybe a bonus from Renar.
		-Ones to get:
			-Material Plane
				-The ability to go home is a hard requirement, lol.
			-The Abyss, given our plans for demons there.
			-The Ethereal Plane, as it makes for excellent scouting.
				-Mechanics are described here: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ethereal_Plane
			-The Astral Plane. Common route to other stuff, via color portals.
				-Yeah, it has other neat properties, Timeless and Enhanced Magic: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Astral_Plane
			-Ysgard. It offers Minor Positive-Dominant, and thus fast healing, along with automatic
			 True Resurection the next morning, should you die there.
	-Pg. 106 of the Manual of the Planes has an interesting poison, made from extra-planar plants from Carceri.
		-It deals acid damage as well as constitution, and the acid might bypass poison resistance,
		 behaving like simple damage
		-Sounds like you konw of it, and where it comes from, at least: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/722944008783134811
		-DC 35 to create!
			-https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/722974409023029259
		-And, yep, the acid affects even stuff immune to poison.
			-Though, from the description, it probably doesn't affect constructs and the like, since
			 it says it "is specially formulated such that its caustic qualities remain quiescent
			 until it comes into contact with living tissue."
	-Get a Power Stone of Keen Edge?
		-https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/keenEdgePsionic.htm
		-375 gp. for the stone.
		-It's a buff you can share with others, unlike most of yours.
			-Would have come in handy with Dog's duel.
			-Look for more like it!

		-Asked Jake to confirm it's kosher here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/865078355203325985
			-It is!
	-Figure out where we want to put the pool, the other reward.
		-Done!
		-We chose to place the pool of the waters of Oceanus in a font on one of the walls of
		 Xûl-Jarak dungeon level 2.


-TODON'T:
	-Payload idea for the faked artifact: planeshift bomb
		-You'll soon have access to plane shift, and Psychic Reformation can always provide item creation feats
		-Destructively overlap sections of two planes?
			-Perhaps overlapping The Abyss with The Nine Hells, to even better keep the demons busy?
		-You can get XP from others if you can homebrew psionic versions of what Renar uses: 	https://discordapp.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/625893957297111040
			-http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060526a
			-Seems reasonable, but it is Jake's call
	-Bracer's of archery?
		-Lesser is 5,000
		-Gives bow *proficiencies*
		-Seperate slot from gloves
		-Eh, now that you're quite high level, you make very few attacks.
	-A Belt of Dwarvenkind would be pretty great, though expensive at 14,900 gp.
		-Most dwarven racial traits including +2 Con. The -2 to Cha skills with those not
		 dwarves, gnomes or halflings is no big deal for you. The +2 untyped to Craft with
		 stone and metal is unusually great for you. (Oh! +2 vs. poisons is also unusually
		 relevant!)
		-Ah, the save bonus is a Resistance bonus, and this also conflicts with the Healing
		 Belt. Probably don't bother.


-Alter Self options by creature type:
	-http://minmaxforum.com/index.php?topic=2811.0


-Descriptive stuff:
	-Astral Construct description I gave to Jake:
		.   All astral constructs are made of ectoplasm, summoned from the astral plane, and always obviously so. The material is white, slightly translucent, and sort of wet, in appearance, with bits of the ectoplasm floating off and dissolving away into nothing as they do. (Page 186 of the Expanded Psionics Handbook has a picture of an example construct.)
		.   In contrast to that one, mine are more hard and angular, cut into shapes like crystalline sculptures of vague humanoids, an impression helped by being somewhat translucent. (Similar in shape to the fighting polygons of Super Smash, or other low polygon 3D figures.) They still appear to be wet or slightly melting, though, as their form slowly boils away, the ectoplasm dissolving back into the aetheric medium of the astral plane.
		.   Since gaining my psicrystal, a level or two back, they've gained a subtle, abstract damask patterned tracery across their crystalline forms. The psicrystal, after all, is my artistic side embodied and given voice, and it's been pushing me to decorate more. (I picked the "Artiste" personality, with it's craft check bonus.)
		.   The constructs I create often appear different, some possessing wings, others bulkier and clawed or spiked, and even vary in size. I can even sculpt them to look like specific creature types or individuals, though I seldom bother unless I see some gain in it. (Corresponds to the menu choices, which are physically implemented, and the level of the construct.)
	-New members being taken to Xûl-Jarak for the first time:
		.   When we Teleport to the fort, we arrive in courtyard filled with piles of cut stone. Edric immediately welcomes the new folks to Xûl-Jarak, and offers them a tour.
		.   Whether or not you take him up on that, you can see that Xûl-Jarak is comprised of a keep built into a thick curtain wall with interior rooms, surrounding the courtyard we arrived in. The fortress shows some damage and it is also obviously of orcish origin, as most of it is covered in carvings of orcs killing humans, elves, and other creatures, or sacrificing them to Gruumsh. The major exception is some newer construction that shows carvings of Dog, Beansinger, Enilias, Leliana, and Edric, along with a warforged, a tiefling, a pair of humans, and many strange, crystalline creatures. They're shown killing dragons, mindflayers, and, of course, orcs, as well as rescuing people, sinking ships, and so forth.
		.   If you _do_ take him up on the tour, and are interested in all the details, I've pasted a map, above, and these are the corresponding descriptions (might need access from Jake):
		https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9scr_GkLFW41FzMBZyRapL_ZJUPCflra0BOEO6J-Jg/edit
	-Fortress repair Fabrication:
		.   After any tour, Edric immediately uses Minor Creation to create a vegetarian feast, with accompanying booze, for the party and for the fortress's staff. Rather than eating himself, though, he steps outside to work on Fabricating fortress repairs.
		.   He sits down, crosslegged, on the ground in the courtyard outside, silently looking at damaged section of the keep. In a matter of moments, cut stone from the many piles of it in the courtyard begins to rise into the air, silently calving off regularly sized pieces that are stacked in place of the rubble now clearing itself away from the damaged corner of the keep. Much of that rubble soon crumbles to sand, mixing midair with similarly crumbled stones from other piles and water from the nearby well to form a mortar soon applied to the stacked stones.
		.   Edric spends close to four hours like that, though he does pause a couple of hours in, asking a guard to inform the rest of the party that new quarters have been made available (#8 on the map) and that, though construction would continue a while longer, it should remain silent. They come complete with more carvings, including a scene of the five folks you've met fighting fire giants, aided by crystalline creatures even bigger than the giants.
	-Road building:
		.   The next day, while we await the Legend Lore casting and after creating another huge spread of food in the dining hall, Edric walks out of the front gate of Xûl-Jarak and again sits down on the ground. A moment later, four of the crystalline creatures from the carvings (Edric's Astral Constructs; see the following addendum for a detailed description) appear. They're somewhat more humanoid than most of the ones in the carvings, albeit with strangely broad and flat hands, and are no bigger than Edric. 
		.   The creatures immediately begin digging in the earth at the base of the ramp leading to Xûl-Jarak's gate, and four more of them appear seconds later and joining them. They continue to blink into existence and march out like soldiers until a couple hundred of them are all digging with their shovel-like hands under Edric's supervision. After hours of that, some of the creatures begin break off and collect gravel and stones from the courtyard, bringing it to the digsite, while others work to compact the earth at the bottom of their newly dug trench.
		.   Soon, they've built up a roadbed and begin laying a cobblestone surface on top of it. They remain at it well into the evening, the creatures seemingly tireless and unimpeded by the darkness and, by the time Edric walks back to the fortress, the creatures gradually disappearing behind him, roughly 200 yards of cobblestone road stretch forth from the fortress, running due South.
		.   Edric continues this each day for the rest of our downtime, bringing a guard shift and one of our scouts with him, after the first day, to guard him as the road stretches further from the fort and to discuss the exact details of the route with. He slows down the last couple days, summoning fewer of his constructs to work on the road and instead Fabricating some repairs to the outside of the walls with stone newly dug up by our hired laborers quarrying in the basement. Even so, by the time Ran is wrapping up the second Legend Lore casting, three miles of road stretch South from Xûl-Jarak, with Melvaunt lying another 57 miles to the South.
