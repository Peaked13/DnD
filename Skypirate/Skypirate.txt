Flaws (compensating for +2 LA):
	-Skulker: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:skulker
		-You're vastly more fragile than many in the society in which you were raised, and you're
		 keenly aware of your mortality.
	-Test Subject: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:test-subject
		-A psionic version, chosing Metacreativity, Pyschometabolism, and Telepathy.
		-The process by which you were created left. . . hooks that other psionic creatures can
		 exploit.

Active Permanent Spells:
	Darkvision 60': https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/darkvision.htm

Skill Tricks Known:
	Dwarven Dance: DC 25 Perform(Dance) check to negate 10 ft. of rough terrain underground.

Advancement:
	-Skill tricks are of course a big deal for rogues: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/skills/skilltricks.html
		-They cost two skill points each.
		-RHETORICAL FLOURISH can help speed Diplomacy!
		-There's a variety of others that are almost as useful.
		-Get:
			Lvl.	Name
			-------------
			4		RHETORICAL FLOURISH (Diplomacy 8)
			4		SOCIAL RECOVERY (Bluff 8 ranks, Diplomacy 5 ranks)?
			9		BACK ON YOUR FEET (Tumble 12)
	-Skills required for prestige classes:
		-Dread Pirate:
			Appraise 8 ranks
			Profession (Sailor) 8 ranks
			Swim 4 ranks (Climb is an acceptable substitute for airships.)
			Use Rope 4 ranks
		-Shadowdancer:
			Move Silently 8 ranks
			Hide 10 ranks
			Perform (dance) 5 ranks.
	-Even more classes?
		-Guild Thief would be amazing, but is 3.0: http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/guild-thief/index.html
			-Found some kind of pirate guild to qualify?
		-Spymaster could be good for a dip, or maybe even more:
			http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/spymaster/index.html
		-The way a bard's Inspire courage stacks with Dread Pirate's Rally the Crew could make a one
		 level dip into bard worth it to get a further +1 to attack and damage for that ability.
	-Possible feats:
		-Psionic Weapon and it's related stuff would be good, but has min. Str 13:
		 https://dndtools.net/feats/expanded-psionics-handbook--65/psionic-weapon--2290/
			-Or the ranged version of that? How do ranged sneak attacks work?
				-It requires Point Blank Shot, and sneak attacks just have to be from <= 30'
			-Both would benefit from improving Concentration, otherwise being one per encounter.
				-Items are an option for that.
		-Craven is _really_ a solid sneak attack feat, especially since it's based on level:
		 http://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/champions-of-ruin--27/craven--484/index.html
		-Hand Crossbow Focus: https://dndtools.net/feats/drow-of-the-underdark--93/hand-crossbow-focus--3426/
		-Shot on the Run: https://dndtools.net/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/shot-on-the-run--2618/
			-This then adds a damage bonus to that if you use crossbows: https://dndtools.net/feats/drow-of-the-underdark--93/xaniqos-school--3464/

Flavor:
	-Creche raised.
		-Clearly special, you were soon a leader amongst your peers (explaining eventual Marshal
		 levels, among other things). Those peers all abandoned you, though, and their old selves,
		 by means of the elan transcendence that is denied to you.
		-Your name honors Edric, and your creche was full of Nedrics, Erics, Cedricks, and such.
			-You're not too fond of it, as a result.
			-Sometimes "Fred the Red".
	-Took to air shortly after leaving his home, The Nested Domains of the Enlightened Edric,
	 seeking freedom, and distance from the portal he'd emerged from.
		-Did he arrive on The Material at XÃ»l-Jarak? Direct to Melvaunt? Someplace new?
		-Did he have some previous relationship with Varani? Lesley had suggested something like that.
			-Yep. Varani is in The Brotherhood's service as well. You met in The Nested Domains, and
			 it was his tales of The Material Plane's vast, liberating vistas that pushed you out of
			 the nest (lol).
		-Since it sounds like our ship is provided by The Brotherhood, how did that go down for you?
			-You described it in game as "like the Prisoner opening sequence": https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/925920343271559259


Character Design Notes:
	-Phrenic Bard, with a one level dip into Marshal?
		-Good option for a social focus, and the +4 Cha mostly negates the level adjustment if
		 skills is what you really care about.
		-Level adjustement buy off could make this even more attractive.
		-Marshall lets you double the Cha bonus applied to skills that use it.
		-Human or Half-Elf? Latter is in the running for their racial +2 to Diplomacy.
	-Rogue instead of Bard?
		-More skill points and good abilities. Probably more attractive if you're not going to have
		 enough Bard levels for it's spellcasting to be much good. More dip-compatible.
		-Shadowdancer? Maybe with more dimensional/planar theming?
			-Possible for a bard too, though less advantageous than with sneak attack.
			-Clashes a bit weirdly with both Marshal auras and bardic music, both being audible.
				-Telepathy, or maybe even whispering, would work around it for the Marshal, and
				 Marshal aura probably works _for yourself_ regardless.
				-Yeah, actually, self is mostly what you want it for, and even then for out of combat.
			-Has Bluff and Diplomacy as class skills.
			-Hmm. . . Spring Attack doesn't actually affect spellcasting. There is Mobile Spell-Casting,
			 but do you even need anything more than your normal move action to hide after casting?
				https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Spring_Attack
				https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/complete-adventurer--54/mobile-spell-casting--1973/
			-Unlikely that more than one level is worth it, though. _Maybe_ two.
				-Hard call if it's worth spending the feats at all, and unfortunately need to do so
				 early-ish.
				-You _do_ really want to hide from getting hit, though.
		-Ranged?
			-The Hide skill's description is generally interesting, but the language of the sniping
			 bit is problematic. Not clear that moving from where you are avoids the -20.
		-Thug varient fighter lets you maintain skills easier, at cost of first bonus feat.
			-http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/thug/index.html
			-Makes it more useful as a BAB dip, though second level bonus feat is still there.
		-Chaotic Neutral, for a rebellious child of Edric?
			-Enables Dread Pirate.
	-Archivist/Erudite into custom Divine/Psionic version of the Cerebremancer?
	-Druid would be fun.
	-Ah, we talked about the next campaign a bit during our last session of the former one.
		-Talked about an aquatic game.
		-Also about starting at level one.
			-Jake did mention doing something to allow level adjustement if need be, though. Maybe
			 taking one flaw per point of LA.
			-Yep, he confirmed that.
			-Flaws:
				Flaw list (Dragon stuff is OK, but get approved):
				http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaws
				SRD Flaws:
				https://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/buildingCharacters/characterFlaws.htm
			-Attractive ones, in lose order of most to least:
				-Skulker: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:skulker
					-Slightly odd fit for captain role.
				-Test Subject: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:test-subject
					-Psionic version?
				-Wild: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:wild
				-Hot Blooded: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:hot-blooded
					-No cold in Edric's spheres.
				-Frail: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:frail
					-Rough. Maybe only if you get to have compensatory high Con.?
				-Fussy: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:fussy
					-Kind of poor flavor, but maybe fitting weird diet in the spheres?
		-Both make the druid a bit more attractive.
		-Oh, maybe _sky_pirates instead?
			-From what Jake says, and from Edric's influence in particular, the world, centuries
			 later, is going to look more like Eberron than Forgotten Realms, with a subtantial
			 magic-technological jump.
			-Psionic skypirate rogue feels very right. . .
			-Profession(Sailor) is still the skill of choice: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/920912643391389708
			-Jake confirmed Climb can be subbed for Swim for airship versions of nautical prestige
			 class requirements: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/922944881171771442
		-Either way, ship-based makes Dread Pirate attractive.
			-Weapon Finesse pushes you towards melee a bit, but a Swashbuckler dip is a way to get
			 it: http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/swashbuckler/index.html
		-Abilities are 4d6, reroll ones:
			12
			16
			12
			14
			8
			18
		-Don't forget template bonuses.
		-Swap Wis and Str, to qualify for Speed of Thought?
			-Eh, there's lots of other ways to boost speed.
