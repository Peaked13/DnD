Flaws (compensating for +2 LA):
	-Skulker: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:skulker
		-You're vastly more fragile than many in the society in which you were raised, and you're
		 keenly aware of your mortality.
	-Test Subject: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:test-subject
		-A psionic version, chosing Metacreativity, Pyschometabolism, and Telepathy.
		-The process by which you were created left. . . hooks that other psionic creatures can
		 exploit.

Active Permanent Spells:
	Darkvision 60': https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/darkvision.htm

Skill Tricks Known:
	Dwarven Dance: DC 25 Perform(Dance) check to negate 10 ft. of rough terrain underground.
	Harmonic Shot: DC 30 Perform check and no move during the turn to give a ranged attack sonic
	               type, yours or others.

Advancement:
	-Skill tricks are of course a big deal for rogues: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/skills/skilltricks.html
		-They cost two skill points each.
		-RHETORICAL FLOURISH can help speed Diplomacy!
		-There's a variety of others that are almost as useful.
		-Get:
			Lvl.	Name
			-------------
			4		RHETORICAL FLOURISH (Diplomacy 8): Rushed Diplomacy at -5 instead of -10.
			4		SOCIAL RECOVERY (Bluff 8 ranks, Diplomacy 5 ranks)?
			9		BACK ON YOUR FEET (Tumble 12)
		-Customize CONCEAL SPELLCASTING???
			-Psionic version would be very useful, but Sleight of Hand doesn't make much sense for
			 something with no somatic components. _Bluff_, though. . . and opposed by Sense Motive?
	-Skills required for prestige classes:
		-Dread Pirate:
			Appraise 8 ranks
			Profession (Sailor) 8 ranks
			Swim 4 ranks (Climb is an acceptable substitute for airships.)
			Use Rope 4 ranks
		-Shadowdancer:
			Move Silently 8 ranks
			Hide 10 ranks
			Perform (dance) 5 ranks.
	-Even more classes?
		-Guild Thief would be amazing, but is 3.0: http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/guild-thief/index.html
			-Found some kind of pirate guild to qualify?
		-Spymaster could be good for a dip, or maybe even more:
			http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/spymaster/index.html
		-The way a bard's Inspire courage stacks with Dread Pirate's Rally the Crew could make a one
		 level dip into bard worth it to get a further +1 to attack and damage for that ability.
		-Legendary captain would be fun if we focus heavily on the ship, and even more if we go
		 beyond letting me take more than a few levls of it: https://dndtools.net/classes/legendary-captain/
			-Leadership score bonuses and random ship-focused abilities.
	-Possible feats:
		-Psionic Weapon and it's related stuff would be good, but has min. Str 13:
		 https://dndtools.net/feats/expanded-psionics-handbook--65/psionic-weapon--2290/
			-Or the ranged version of that? How do ranged sneak attacks work?
				-It requires Point Blank Shot, and sneak attacks just have to be from <= 30'
			-Both would benefit from improving Concentration, otherwise being one per encounter.
				-Items are an option for that.
		-Craven is _really_ a solid sneak attack feat, especially since it's based on level:
		 http://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/champions-of-ruin--27/craven--484/index.html
		-Hand Crossbow Focus: https://dndtools.net/feats/drow-of-the-underdark--93/hand-crossbow-focus--3426/
		-Shot on the Run: https://dndtools.net/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/shot-on-the-run--2618/
			-This then adds a damage bonus to that if you use crossbows: https://dndtools.net/feats/drow-of-the-underdark--93/xaniqos-school--3464/

Flavor:
	-Creche raised.
		-Clearly special, you were soon a leader amongst your peers (explaining eventual Marshal
		 levels, among other things). Those peers all abandoned you, though, and their old selves,
		 by means of the elan transcendence that is denied to you.
		-Your name honors Edric, and your creche was full of Nedrics, Erics, Cedricks, and such.
			-You're not too fond of it, as a result.
			-Sometimes "Fred the Red".
	-Took to air shortly as he was leaving his home, The Nested Domains of the Enlightened Edric,
	 seeking freedom, and distance from the portal he'd emerged from.
		-Did he arrive on The Material at XÃ»l-Jarak? Direct to Melvaunt? Someplace new?
		-Did he have some previous relationship with Varani? Lesley had suggested something like that.
			-Yep. Varani is in The Brotherhood's service as well. You met in The Nested Domains, and
			 it was his tales of The Material Plane's vast, liberating vistas that pushed you out of
			 the nest (lol).
		-Since it sounds like our ship is provided by The Brotherhood, how did that go down for you?
			-You described it in game as "like the Prisoner opening sequence": https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/925920343271559259


Character Design Notes:
	-Phrenic Bard, with a one level dip into Marshal?
		-Good option for a social focus, and the +4 Cha mostly negates the level adjustment if
		 skills is what you really care about.
		-Level adjustement buy off could make this even more attractive.
		-Marshall lets you double the Cha bonus applied to skills that use it.
		-Human or Half-Elf? Latter is in the running for their racial +2 to Diplomacy.
	-Rogue instead of Bard?
		-More skill points and good abilities. Probably more attractive if you're not going to have
		 enough Bard levels for it's spellcasting to be much good. More dip-compatible.
		-Shadowdancer? Maybe with more dimensional/planar theming?
			-Possible for a bard too, though less advantageous than with sneak attack.
			-Clashes a bit weirdly with both Marshal auras and bardic music, both being audible.
				-Telepathy, or maybe even whispering, would work around it for the Marshal, and
				 Marshal aura probably works _for yourself_ regardless.
				-Yeah, actually, self is mostly what you want it for, and even then for out of combat.
			-Has Bluff and Diplomacy as class skills.
			-Hmm. . . Spring Attack doesn't actually affect spellcasting. There is Mobile Spell-Casting,
			 but do you even need anything more than your normal move action to hide after casting?
				https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Spring_Attack
				https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/complete-adventurer--54/mobile-spell-casting--1973/
			-Unlikely that more than one level is worth it, though. _Maybe_ two.
				-Hard call if it's worth spending the feats at all, and unfortunately need to do so
				 early-ish.
				-You _do_ really want to hide from getting hit, though.
		-Ranged?
			-The Hide skill's description is generally interesting, but the language of the sniping
			 bit is problematic. Not clear that moving from where you are avoids the -20.
		-Thug varient fighter lets you maintain skills easier, at cost of first bonus feat.
			-http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/thug/index.html
			-Makes it more useful as a BAB dip, though second level bonus feat is still there.
		-Chaotic Neutral, for a rebellious child of Edric?
			-Enables Dread Pirate.
	-Archivist/Erudite into custom Divine/Psionic version of the Cerebremancer?
	-Druid would be fun.
	-Ah, we talked about the next campaign a bit during our last session of the former one.
		-Talked about an aquatic game.
		-Also about starting at level one.
			-Jake did mention doing something to allow level adjustement if need be, though. Maybe
			 taking one flaw per point of LA.
			-Yep, he confirmed that.
			-Flaws:
				Flaw list (Dragon stuff is OK, but get approved):
				http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaws
				SRD Flaws:
				https://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/buildingCharacters/characterFlaws.htm
			-Attractive ones, in lose order of most to least:
				-Skulker: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:skulker
					-Slightly odd fit for captain role.
				-Test Subject: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:test-subject
					-Psionic version?
				-Wild: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:wild
				-Hot Blooded: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:hot-blooded
					-No cold in Edric's spheres.
				-Frail: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:frail
					-Rough. Maybe only if you get to have compensatory high Con.?
				-Fussy: http://eberronunlimited.wikidot.com/flaw:fussy
					-Kind of poor flavor, but maybe fitting weird diet in the spheres?
		-Both make the druid a bit more attractive.
		-Oh, maybe _sky_pirates instead?
			-From what Jake says, and from Edric's influence in particular, the world, centuries
			 later, is going to look more like Eberron than Forgotten Realms, with a subtantial
			 magic-technological jump.
			-Psionic skypirate rogue feels very right. . .
			-Profession(Sailor) is still the skill of choice: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/920912643391389708
			-Jake confirmed Climb can be subbed for Swim for airship versions of nautical prestige
			 class requirements: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/922944881171771442
		-Either way, ship-based makes Dread Pirate attractive.
			-Weapon Finesse pushes you towards melee a bit, but a Swashbuckler dip is a way to get
			 it: http://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/swashbuckler/index.html
		-Abilities are 4d6, reroll ones:
			12
			16
			12
			14
			8
			18
		-Don't forget template bonuses.
		-Swap Wis and Str, to qualify for Speed of Thought?
			-Eh, there's lots of other ways to boost speed.

		12 (Cha)
	-Cohort Design Notes:
		-Shadowcraft Mage will be amazing once you have a 4th level Shadow Spell: https://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/shadowcraft-mage/index.html
			-Possible to take as your 8th level.
				-Ah, maybe only later, due to skills. Should have focused on this earlier.
			-Oh, fuck yeah. This is worth sacricifing a lot for, and you mostly just need to spend
			 skill points on Bluff and Hide (solid skills!) and (mostly) waste the Silent Spell you
			 already took.
		-Feats:
			-Metamagic:
				-Still Spell and Silent Spell?
					-Silent Spell is probably the biggest deal for concealing casting: https://dndtools.net/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/silent-spell--2626/
					-Still can be obviated by simply hiding, or using cover.
				-Extend Spell?
					-Solid, for a support caster and only one spell level.
					-Mostly obviated by Gnome Illusionist, though.
			-Reserve feats? Tempting early ones:
				-Acidic Splatter: https://dndtools.net/feats/complete-mage--58/acidic-splatter--24/
					-Melf's Acid Arrow obviously satisfies.
					-Ah, range is _way_ too limiting.
				-Fiery Burst: https://dndtools.net/feats/complete-mage--58/fiery-burst--1123/
					-Flaming Sphere or Scorching Ray satisfy, and easy to find higher ones.
					-This one, if any.
				-Shadow Veil: https://dndtools.net/feats/complete-mage--58/shadow-veil--2566/
					-Darkness qualifies, but, eh, only 20% miss chance for a round.
			-Spell Focus (Illusion)?
				-DCs aren't as big of a deal with illusions as other stuff, though maybe still
				 something to _eventually_ pick up.
			-Improved Initiative?
				-Can't get as a bonus feat.
				-Ah, but you're losing your 5th level bonus to Gnome Illusionist, and probably
				 the 10 level one too.
				-Hummingbird will also mean you've already got good initiative.
			-Later levels:
				-Ship's Mage: http://www.theworldofnocturne.com/dndtools/feats/stormwrack--87/ships-mage--2613/index.html
					-Neat if we spend tons of time aboard, but not amazing for illusionists.
		-They'll be level 4 to start, if you indeed get Leadership at 6.
		-CN Gnome Illusionist?
			-Good article on when you save vs. illusions: https://web.archive.org/web/20090122075217/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20060221a
			-Gnome is definitely solid for an illusionist.
				-+1 to Illusion spell DCs.
				-Alchemy bonus is solid for ships too, furnishing novel alchemical weapons and maybe
				 dovetailing with cannons or more traditional seige weapons.
				-If any gnome, then forest gnome seems a no-brainer. It seemingly only has upsides
				 over the default: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gnomes,_Forest_(Race)
				-Considers himself a "paragon of gnomishness".
			-Sorcerer or wizard?
				-Charisma also:
					-Is the basis for gnome spell-likes.
					-Helps Disguise, a big-deal skill for illusions (though _you_ also help that a ton).
				-Intelligence also:
					-Helps with alchemy.
				-Variant Illusionist wizards are interesting: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/specialistWizardVariants.htm#chainsofDisbelief
					-Chains of Disbelief is super cool, but maybe actually a downside when working
					 with a ship's crew.
					-Shadow Shaper might be worth the hefty price, given how it dovetails with what
					 you do. Precludes the next two options, though.
					-Focused Specialist might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#focused-specialist
					-Gnome Illusionist also looks interesting, especially the first two levels: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#gnome-illusionist
					-It does seem possible to take both.
				-Sorcerers have their own variants:
					-This list is super useful: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/variant/variantList.html
					-Illusion Sphere might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#socerer-spheres
					-If religious, there's some fun divine variants:
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#divine-companion
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#domain-access
				-Ah, wizards having Scribe Scroll goes well with your UMD score.
				-If a specialist wizard, what two schools do you give up?
					-Necromancy is almost certainly one, for flavor and usefulness both. "What fun
					 are the dead? Even the ones that think just keep going, "Flesshh. . ." or "Blud!"
					-Abjuration is probably the other. Biggest pain is no dispels.
					-Yep, lets do those two.
				-Oh, and Gnome Illusionist, discussed above reduces your caster level by 1 for
				 another school. It's attractive, so which one?
					-Divination might be a good fit. Not harmed too much by the level loss, it also
					 fits the carefree, gnomish attitude I'm imagining here.
						-NOPE! Rereading, it has to be evocation, transmutation, or conjuration.
					-Lets go with Transmutation, since it'll mostly mean minor duration reductions.
			-Cat familiar's +3 to Move Silently helps someone who casts invisibility, and fits a ship.
				-Oh, this list is amazing: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#variant-familiars
				-Hummingbird, for +4 Initiative, definitely rivals cat.
					-It's from Dragon Magazine #323, pg. 98 (you have the PDF and physical copy).
					-Thrush stats are on DMG pg. 203.
					-Oh! They even live in forests (among other places): https://www.hummingbird-guide.com/hummingbird-habitat.html#:~:text=Hummingbirds%20are%20wild%20birds%20with,country%20and%20in%20the%20cities.
						-Might mean a Forest Gnome can speak with them. . .
							-Yep: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/1097237933662158948
					-Yeah, lets do a hummingbird.
			-Interesting applications with ships, especially flying ones.
				-How big can you make illusions? Big enough to hide a ship in a cloud?
					-1st level spell Silent Image is plenty big, with a duration of Concentration!
					-Ah, but can an illusion _follow_ a ship? Silent Image seems to have a static
					 location. _Maybe_ tortured logic would consider a ship a location. . .
						-Seems like it's not a settled question: https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/195428/can-the-permanent-image-spell-move-with-the-caster
						-Thus, probably a DM call.
						-Jake said they can: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/1097238122460368990
			-Illusionist is a great fit for social rogue.
				-Lies + illusions = profit.
				-Invisibility + rogues = death.
				-Eventual Simulacrums are an amazing effect from a cohort: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/simulacrum.htm
			-Gear:
				-Will start with expected character wealth for level: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1095123367343964190
					-That's 5400 gp.
					-After that, Fred funds him (or whatever else the party agrees to. . .)
				-Continual Flame torch or other light source?
					-Buy it, or get spell and cast yourself for 50 gp.?
					-Opted for the latter, as it might be useful aboard ship.
				-Alchemical stuff!
					-Extensive list of possible options: https://orbitalflower.github.io/rpg/dnd3-extended-alchemy-items-list.html
					-Only risk losing materials if you fail by 5 or more, so safe to assume anything
					 where your bonus + 1 is within 4 of DC auto-succeeds.
						-You have +12 at level 4, or +14 with a lab
				-Spells:
					-See "Spells Copied from Anotherâs Spellbook or a Scroll" here for details of
					 copying them: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicOverview/arcaneSpells.htm
						-Weirdly, scrolls are the cheap option for level 1, but the 50 x level
						 for copying it from others' spellbooks is the better option for higher
						 levels (and some first level stuff with material components).
					-Spells purchased:
						150		Major Image
						100		Darkvision
						100		Continual Flame
					-Runner up spells (you might want later):
