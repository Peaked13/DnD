-Fred's speaking patterns:
	-Oh, shit, I forgot I'd written this in my notes:
	 "'Dric's crystal cock! This was turning into a mess. I wanted out of the splash zone."
	-"'Dric" being him slurring the name "Edric". I need to do more of this, coming up with slang
	 from Edric's plane, where Fredrick comes from. . .
-Other sayings?
	-"May you / hope you / etc." + "drown in slime / Rovert / Rov-slime / etc."?
	-"Conjure / manifest / whip up" + "some grub"?
	-"The spheres" as an informal name for Edric's Realm.

-Edric's sense of. . . family:
	DMJake — Today at 1:23 PM
	A mix between a family business and a cult

	Fredrick (Andy) — Today at 1:30 PM
	Edric likes to think of all of it as all just. . . Edric.
	Fred's got some problems with that view, and with authority, as a result. And with the fact that Edric mucked about in his genome.
-Fred was creche raised:
	-Clearly special, you were soon a leader amongst your peers (explaining eventual Marshal
	 levels, among other things). Those peers all abandoned you, though, and their old selves,
	 by means of the elan transcendence that is denied to you.
	-Your name honors Edric, and your creche was full of Nedrics, Erics, Cedricks, Teds, and such.
		-You're not too fond of it, as a result.
		-Sometimes "Fred the Red".
-A discussion of Fred's parents (context at the link): https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1234594543630815252
	"Whoa! I don't think I ever met my father, but I don't have anything against him. I need you to help me deal with the god that made me. There were still, like, parents involved, though."
	"It does rather seem like you lot spent a lot more time with your parents than I did with mine, though. . ."
-The lack of strictness in Fred's upbringing:
	Jade Shadowfeather/shroud — Today at 1:41 PM
	I imagine the lawkeepers in Edric's realm Fred him the riot act a lot

	Fredrick (Andy) — Today at 1:42 PM
	lol
	I actually think they were rather lenient with Fred, contributing to his somewhat brash and selfish nature to this day.
	Fred, like other bred-by-Edric phrenics, is one of god's R&D projects. You're not going to risk interfering with that just because of some drunk and disorderly conduct. . .
	Plus, in my background stuff I've been putting together for Ed and Fred, phrenic humans can't become elans (the rules sort of imply that, but that's mostly me making shit up). Ed tried it with his old cohort, who is now a slimemold-like growth covering several city blocks and displaying disturbing signs of precognition. That's a big chunk of why Fred is pissed at Ed, since he's been effectively denied immortality, and why the forces of Edric's order go easy on him: "Eh, the problem will solve itself in only a century or so. We can wait. . ."
-The kind of behavior that led to, in response to Jade and Lucien regaling Fred with a cautionary
 tale from a dream they shared, concerning a wild bard now in a kind of purgatory: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1054115336632406036/1204260716367061094
	"Cautionary, smauthionary! What am I supposed to learn from your dream? That dying is a bad move? I already knew *that* one! The power of dance?  Nothin' to learn there either! Watch!"
	*Fred boogies out of the room.*
	*Poking his head back in for a moment:*
	"Shiiit, maybe you two need to learn from *me*," Fred adds. Then, bursting into song, and badly off key, he leaves again. "I've got to get too drunk to dream. . ."
-Took to air shortly as he was leaving his home, The Nested Domains of the Enlightened Edric,
 seeking freedom, and distance from the portal he'd emerged from.
	-Did he arrive on The Material at Xûl-Jarak? Direct to Melvaunt? Someplace new?
	-Did he have some previous relationship with Varani? Lesley had suggested something like that.
		-Yep. Varani is in The Brotherhood's service as well. You met in The Nested Domains, and
		 it was his tales of The Material Plane's vast, liberating vistas that pushed you out of
		 the nest (lol).
	-Since it sounds like our ship is provided by The Brotherhood, how did that go down for you?
		-You described it in game as "like the Prisoner opening sequence": https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/925920343271559259
	-Jade asked some questions about how Fred left home, and got the airship. You wrote a bunch
	 about the subject here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560916449527332877/1238203194635718748

		Today at 4:32 PM
		". . . So. . . I didn't escape," Fred replies, with some obvious reluctance. "It's more that I got a job."
		"See, back in his. . . more mortal. . .ish days, Edric was an adventurer. For, like, several decades. Naturally, he continues to use that model of things, commissioning groups of people willing to advance his interest in something, when more formal approaches like his insufferable clerics aren't suitable."
		Fredrick (Andy)
		 — 
		Today at 4:43 PM
		"A lot of those groups are. . . well, call them 'scouts'. Edric and his realm. . . not sure 'Dric sees those as separate things. . . they can make almost anything you can imagine. He's really interested in opportunities to sell all that. . . Trade it for the rare stuff he can't make, or at least not easily."
		"Magic's a big one he's after, enchanted items and the like, and so too is samples of, or information about, stuff nobody in the spheres has imagined yet: new ideas, designs, and the like. Information in general, I guess, too."
		Fredrick (Andy)
		 — 
		Today at 4:50 PM
		"So he sends people out, people from his Realm who want a change of scenery or useful outsiders, to bring that back. Airships the spheres definitely can make, and they're a popular tool of the trade."
		"When I got out of the creche, I wanted out of the spheres as fast I could. This gig offered that. . . and, honestly, all that aside, what's not to like about being a well-dressed, hard-drinking super spy. . . super scout, dripping with charm?"
		Fredrick (Andy)
		 — 
		Today at 4:59 PM
		"I was actually rather surprised I was. . . allowed. . . to take the job, even though I practiced and studied for this harder than I ever had, before or since. My whole time in the spheres I was treated like someone's prize snow shrew. . . and this gig's dangerous. I'm the only surviving member of the original ship's original crew."
		"But, though this offered a long leash, the leash is still there. . . and now that crystal prick is yanking on it. Poor Grimble's caught in the middle. . ." 
		Fredrick (Andy)
		 — 
		Today at 5:08 PM
		". . . just remember that before taking any deals these people are offering. As much or more as he wants information and magic, Edric wants control. . . or at least you acting how he decides is best. I don't think what we. . . anyone around him. . . wants matters. . . any more than you care what a chair wants. We're all just useful to him. . . or in the way. . ."
		"I was born under his sway, some part of his plan. . . Don't go accepting any his strings if you can avoid it."
-Help Jake figure out what Edric has been up to: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/934519433462939659
	-We talked about it here:
		DMJake — Today at 12:46 PM
		Can you give me a few things for Edric over the past 1000 years 
		1. Goals for Material Plane 
			-Crystal epic spell.
		2. Goals for your Plane
			-Heavily urbanized, and a homeland for psionic weirdos.
				-More psionic folks + Bestow Power is also a big deal for Edric, and maybe even
				 an economy.
		3. Goals for your relationship to the Brotherhood of Xul Jarak
		Peaked — Today at 1:07 PM
		OK! I'll think that over.
		Are you in any particular rush? Needing to get this by next session or the like?
		1000 years is longer than I had been imagining, and I'm going to have fun with that if I've got the time.
		DMJake — Today at 1:12 PM
		not in a rush, and I have a system for resolving the timeline 
		I've broken it down into periods of around 3 to 4 hundred years
		Peaked — Today at 1:16 PM
		Since Edric's creation powers work in volumes, I wonder if I can figure out a way to compare that to real figures. Something like, with Edric dedicating X% of his time and Y power points per day, he will have personally replicated Z years of the modern US's industrial output over that millennia. I'm going to have fun with this. . .
	-Productive output:
		-TEU's seem like a promising unit to look for, for volumes of trade: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105244/monthly-retail-import-volume-us/
			-Formal definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-foot_equivalent_unit
			-From that, it suggests one TEU = 1,172 cu ft.
		-With infinite power points, you can manage to Greater Fabricate:
			100*25/10 = 250 cu ft. / round organic, or (24-8)*60*10*250 = 2,400,000 cu ft. / day
		-So, 2,400,000/1,172 = 2047 TEU / day, or 747,155 TEU / year
			-Small relative to global throughput: https://www.statista.com/statistics/913398/container-throughput-worldwide/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20global%20container%20throughput,compared%20with%20the%20previous%20year.
			-A mere 1.5% of the throughput of Shanghai's port, though that's the busiest in the world: https://www.statista.com/statistics/264171/turnover-volume-of-the-largest-container-ports-worldwide/
			-Still, the above wiki page suggests that's 747,155/11000 = 67.92 huge container ships.
		-Divide by 10 for inorganic.
		-Divine Earth Mastery, though, produces effectively infinite quantities of precious metals
		 in a mere round.
	-Edric's plane:
		-What is it called?
			-I thought I had a name, but can't find it.
			-The Crystal Domains of the Enlightened Edric?
		-Description from the end of the Xûl-Jarak game:
			-Edric first sought out his kin, the other elans, and the means to make them. Soon he
			 was populating his plane with his immortal kindred, uplifting promising mortals minds.
			-Beneath it's barren outer layer of gates, Edric's nested paradise of the mind urbanized
			 heavily, it's population mostly elans and others naturally psionic. Others found the
			 plane both strange and harsh, with weird customs and expensive imported food.
			-Soon, from his plane, strange crystals grew (a creation of Edric's next epic spell),
			 spreading outward from it's gates, and covering seemingly most surfaces within. It was
			 rumored that Edric could reach anywhere the crystals did (or even that he _was_ the
			 crystals), and also that his power grew as the crystals did.
			-Rovert, his cohort, did not ascend to divinity, as many of the others did. A man well
			 into his middle years by the time he joined his will to Edric's, his body began failing
			 soon into Edric's divine reign. Not entirely human, Edric feared the potential
			 consequnces of attemping to make Rovert an elan, but feared losing his right hand even
			 more, and Rovert was all too willing. The massive slimemold-like creature that grew
			 from his body, with it's alien intelligence, is now the story commonly cited to
			 illustrate the danger of such things.
		-Light in the plane is omnipresent and directionless, seemingly emanating from the air
		 itself. Closed containers and even whole rooms are dark or fairly dim, but large
		 volumes of air are steadily brighter, with any space bigger than a small house needing
		 no further light to read by and the outside spaces of the layers being bright as day,
		 constantly.
		-Water?
			-Probably no _huge_ bodies of it, due to problems keeping it contained in the
			 strange gravity. Edric is also an _Earth_ diety, after all.
			-Instead, the plane's limited water is spread throughout clearly artificial
			 reservoirs, canals, decorative waterworks, and elaborate plumbing.
		-Vegetation?
			-Less food cultivation than one would expect, but 1,000 years is plenty to have
			 imported and spread all necessary vegetation and animals.
			-What sorts of flora and fauna thrive?
				-Due to the omnipresent light and warmth of the plane, tropical and polar
				 species tend to do best. Tropical stuff does well in the constant warmth,
				 while polar species seem less disrupted than some by the lack of night.
					-Polar fauna often still hiberanate, but in cycles that tend to drift over
					 time, sometimes ending up with multiple distinct populations on different
					 hibernation cycles.
						-"Snow shrews" are popular pets on the plane, and follow this model,
						 with different broods on different cycles having distinct (and much
						 discussed) behaviors and colorations.
				-City dwellers? Urban species likely do well, but metal buildings and ubiquitous
				 surveillance probably mean limited pest species like rats.
		-Layers (outer to inner):
			-The Borderlands:
				-Studded with portals, leading to a variety of destinations.
				-Flat and desert-like.
				-Tribes of Thri-kreen loyal to Edric are the main inhabitants.
				-It's also spanned by a network of canals, used for freight.
			-About 92 layers of air beneath it, each 280' with 280' of earth and stone between each.
				-How many is partly a function of time passed since planar creation.
					-Growth over time defined here: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/genesis.htm
					-So, 180' radius in 180 days, than 1' more per week since.
					-Jake previously mentioned it had been something like 1000 years.
					-So, 180+(365-180)/7+999*365/7 = 52,297'
						-Or, the plane is 9.9 miles in radius. Way more than I thought.
				-How far between each layer?
					-Google says a story is about 14'.
					-Lets say 10 stories of building room on either side, for 20 stories between
					 layers, or 280 ft.
					-Hmm. . . Even with the each layer being that thick itself, that's a _ton_ of
					 layers. 52,297/(280*2) = 93, to be exact.
						-What kind of surface area is that?
							-The Borderlands are 1231 square miles. Bigger than Rhode Island's 1,034,
							 but well under Delaware's (next smallest) 1,955.
							-Total: 4pi*r^2 + 4pi*(r-280)^2 + 4pi*(r-280*2)^2 + . . 
								Sum from 0 to Z of 4pi*(r-280x)^2
								where Z = 52,297/2 (plus or minus one or two)
								In Wolfram: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sum+4pi*%2852297-280k%29%5E2+from+k+%3D+1+to+52%2C297%2F2
							-So, 2.06128301 × 10^11 square miles
								-Surface area of the Earth is 196,900,000 sq. miles.
								-So, that's 1000x the surface of the Earth. . .
								-A thousand Earths, with no point much more than 20 miles away from
								 any other. . .
			-Other layers:
				-Environments for more unusual psionic creatures?
				-A layer given over to The-Slimemold-That-Was-Rovert.
					-Formerly an inhabited layer, it was where Rovert's experimental transformation
					 into (what was supposed to be) an Elan took place. As such, the mass of the
					 slimemold-analog is draped over abandoned but still pristine (due to largely
					 being adamantine) buildings.
					-In fact, it's behavior among the abandoned structures is part of the argument
					 for it's intelligence. It clearly displayed knowledge or understanding of the
					 area in prioritizing growth towards food, water, or other resources.
						-Tests of this capability uncovered evidence that it began to seek empty
						 areas that would be seeded with bait _even before the experiment was
						 commisioned_, suggesting that it's continued psionic capabilities include
						 precognition.
					-Probably near The Basilica.
				-Doubtlessly some empty/empty-ish layers, given their large number and the steady
				 calving of new ones over time.
			-The Basilica:
				-The several layers nearest Edric's Sanctum.
				-It's one enormous temple complex, dedicated to Edric.
			-Edric's Sanctum:
				-This, the site of Edric's ascension, remains a small spherical cavity pierced
				 through innumerable times by enormous crystals. Edric spends most of his here,
				 meditating in the center with the crystals intersecting his form.
		-Some discussion of the plane with Jake: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/1234605030644912138
		-I also wrote a bit here about what Fred thinks Ed can do, doing some good description of

			"Look, Maya, I don't think I'd even recommend trying that on me, let alone a god. What ever Edric did, mucking about in my ancestry, it's left me awfully resistant to magic when I put my mind to it. . . and you can bet that crystal bastard kept the best stuff to himself.
			 We're outclassed here, Maya. This an actual god. I was raised on stories of him turning mountains into gold and, while I bet a lot of what I heard in class was bullshit. . . we didn't use gold to settle accounts, and I have walked streets lined by adamantine spires dozens of stories tall, a thing that's notably scarce here, outside the personal fief of a god.
			 Simple spells aren't going to be able to cut it. We need to be prepared to pay. . . and to pay a lot. We're not the ones with the power here. . ."
	-Inputs (what he trades for or otherwise consumes):
		-Magic, souls, and organics.
	-Outputs (what he produces, for himself and others):
		-Finished goods of extremely high quality.
			-Structures included.
		-All sorts of earths and metals, adamantine in particular.
		-Minds. Often strange, often immortal.
	-Edric's construction style:
		-Had a conversation with Jake about it here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/1239707775014010934
			Edric is able to shape stone like clay and transmute it to any metal he needs too. Buildings in his realm, and especially stuff he personally creates like this holy space, are far from normal feeling construction and instead highly artificial structures of spun adamntine and mithral.
			Ooo, I'm now picturing stuff inspired by the Warhammer 40k Eldar, which that picked image definitely also reminds me a bit of.
			Stuff like this, in a mixture of adamantine-black and impossibly shiny mithral:

			https://tabletopterrain.com/collections/eldar-terrain/products/eldari-walls-and-barricades
			https://tabletopterrain.com/collections/eldar-terrain
		-40k Eldar as a style reference, and maybe even potential art source!
		-Often olored in a mixture of "mixture of adamantine-black and impossibly shiny mithral".
	-Where "he", in the above stuff, refers to not just Edric, but his plane, his worshippers
	 (and more tightly-bound "believers", from thrallherd), and the whole society of people on
	 the plane and linked to it. Edric thinks of all of this as "himself".
