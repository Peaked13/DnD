12/29/21:
	-We're members of a scouting party sent out by The Brotherhood.
		-We were furnished with an airship and sent out to explore The Material, seeking wonders,
		 knowledge, and resources.
		-Larix serves as our helmsman, capable of communicating with the bound air elementals that
		 power the ship.
			-The hull is Edric-built, sailing forth from one of his enormous factory cathedrals, but
			 the service of the elementals was purchased.
			-The "engines" require regular castings of a spell to keep running. A common service, it
			 runs about 50 gp. for our ship, and our engines currently have two weeks of runtime
			 left.
		-Your individual tasking probably resembled this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalndXdxriI
	-After days over the ocean, we came to a kind of port city, newer spires surmounting ancient
	 machinery, and docks below, on the shores of the island this all stands on.
		-Low on supplies, and with Larix assuring us this at least wasn't actively hostile territory,
		 we decided to dock.
		-The city's name proved to be Sasserine.
		-It had recently undergone some kind of change in leadership, "the guilds" having "abandoned
		 the city", with The Dawn Council taking it's place.
			-Indeed, we saw several on the street bearing a sun emblem, along other badges: a
			 lighthouse surrounded by a dragon, a sword with a shield and helmet, a tiger with a
			 rose, and a spider and keep.
		-The city seems to be mostly human.
		-Ruins were frequently in evidence, broken bridges and the like, that seemed to indicate the
		 city had been rebuilt several times.
	-In paying the docking fee, we also heard about a job oppotunity, a lady offering work, and
	 requesting candidates meet her at her estate tomorrow evening.
	-In the meantime, we found a tavern, The Drunken Bear.
		-Talking with the barkeep, we learned more about Lavinia. Apparently she'd lost her family
		 in an airship accident, leaving just her and a sibling.
		-The barkeep also seemed none too fond of The Dawn Council, on account of new taxes.
		-She also told us of the city's seven districts:
			-The Champion District, with the arena and other entertainments.
			-The Merchant District, where we docked and were staying.
			-The Cudgel District.
			-The Sun District.
			-The Noble District.
			-The Azure District.
			-The Shadowshore, the one part of the city where the dawn can't reach. . .
		-We also rented a room there.
	-With time to kill, we also checked out the markets of The Merchant District, finding some
	 decent options for resupplying the ship.
	-Varani kept hiding his face when we passed those bearing the emblem of The Dawn Council.
		-I asked him what the deal was and he said someone he'd "rather not talk about" had paid
		 them to capture him.
	-We spent the night at The Drunken Bear.
		-During the early hours of the morning, Varani heard me mumbling in my sleep: "No! No more
		 ink blots. . ."
	-When we woke, Varani was gone.
		-Asking the barkeep, she left about two hours before I came down, and outside there was a
		 lot more Council activity. . .
		-Once Larix woke too, though, he consulted his hawk, who led us to a dead-end alley, and
		 Varani then descended from a hiding place atop some crates and beneath the eaves of a
		 building.
		-Apparently The Dawn Council is looking for her in force, hand she was unable to get back
		 to the bar after going for a run.
	-We decided to find a way to The Shadowshore, and lie low until our dinner tonight.
	-After some quick patches to an abandoned skiff, we took to the water, to cross the lagoon,
	 but opted instead to stop on a deserted, brush-and-trash-strewn island. It seemed a good 
	 hiding spot.
		-Not entirely deserted, as it turned out. I heard the sound of some voices speaking in
		 Goblin somewhere nearby.
		-I crept over and listened in. It seemed they were a party of scrappers, arguing over salvage.
		-Goblins seem generally _tolerated_, if looked down upon, so I decided we should leave them be.
		-There's bigger fish in the water tonight, and no sense showing up to a lady's house smelling
		 like we'd been rolling around in trash with goblins.
	-As the time came, we headed to our dinner.
		-After knocking, we were ushered inside.
		-A party of armored folks were exiting as we entered. Apparently Lady Lavinia has other
		 suitors. . .
			-Varani knew them as a group of mercenaries, "The Jade Ravens".
			-They were talking about being sent to the city of Cauldron, to the South.
		-As we spoke with Lady Lavinia, she spoke of money troubles, a vault beneath a castle, and
		 the two signet rings that can open the vault. Her father's is the only one available, but
		 it's aboard an impounded ship.
			-She paid the fine, but the man holding the ship claims to have never received it, and
			 she suspects he's up to something, aboard the ship.
				-Soller Vark is his name, and she suspects him of being a smuggler.
			-She asks that we recover her money, and, if possible, find out what he's doing aboard
			 the ship.
				-I haggled for 250 gp. in exchange for the task and she directed us to the ship.
	-Heading there, the ship proved not to be docked, but moored some distance out form the peer.
	-We opted to pretend to fish on our skiff, and keep an eye on ship until midnight at least.
		-No one came or went, and the deck was deserted save a sentry that came out from time to
		 time, but animal noises came from within the hold.
		-We tried climbing the anchor chain, but it. . . did not go well. I was able to play off the
		 noise as a drunk Varani falling while fishing, but we then had to row out of there as the
		 sentry shoed us off.
		-We opted to return another night.


1/12/22:
	-Returning to our own ship to spend the night, given the goons looking for Varani near the inn,
	 we debated our strategy.
	-We didn't come up with anything better, though, and Varani claims she's not normally that clumsy,
	 so we opted to keep watch over the ship for another day, and attempt boarding again after
	 nightfall if we don't catch someone leaving the ship.
	-A little while into the morning, we boarded our skiff and headed out onto the bay to watch the
	 ship.
		-Near nightfall, the ship headed in toward the dock it had been tied to, some distance out.
		-We followed, and as we neared the ship, we could hear them shouting about making the ship
		 ready for departure.
		-We beached the skiff and hurried towards the dock, Larix employing his shapechanger
		 heritage to disguise him as one of the crew.
			-Ducking behind a crate, he tried to hide to cast a spell, summoning a mist to give the
			 rest of us some cover.
			-He was caught in that, but his disguise worked, and he was shoed aboard the departing
			 ship.
		-Varani then tried playing it cool, carrying a random crate aboard, while I crouched behind
		 one still on the docks.
		-Didn't go too well, though. A sentry questioned her, and she then dropped the crate and ran
		 aboard.
		-Well, there's my distraction, so I attempted to sneak aboard myself.
		-Varani threw a punch at one of the thugs, and a brawl ensued.
		-Larix tried his spell again, calling up the mist, but at least one of the sentries began
		 pointing and shouting at him as he did so.
		-With the shit kicking off, I ran into the now-present fog, towards someone shouting from
		 the upper deck on one end of the ship.
			-Hmm. . . I may lie to the lady about what went down here. "Some fight with criminal
			 rivals, no doubt. . ."
		-Hearing some commotion nearby, I crept up on someone stomping around in the fog, only to
		 trip over a length of rope abandoned on deck. Someone began shouting at me to keep back,
		 so I stabbed into the fog with my rapier, but didn't connect with anything.
		-Things went pretty far South. After another vain fog-stabbing, and a legit me-stabbing, I
		 ran the fuck away, back onto the dock and ducking behind a crate..
		-These aren't good odds. I figured I might be able to buy some time, though, and set about
		 sabatoging the ramp running from ship to dock, wedging a stake found on the dock into the
		 rotating mechanism it was locked into. Now, as the ship moved with the waves, it squeals,
		 and probably won't be easily undone.
		-I then made my way towards the seaward end of the ship, where the anchor chain and the
		 docking rope were, aiming to sabatoge those too.
			-I had to take it slow, though, darting from cover to cover, having seen thugs
			 brandishing crossbows on the ship.
		-Meanwhile, the commotion in the fog seemed to intensify. There was some kind of metalic-
		 sounding shrieking, as if from something breaking, and then running and thuds.
		-I got to the anchor and, seeing the quick-release lever for it's winch, leaned over onto
		 the ship, and pulled it, dropping the anchor. I then darted back, further down the dock,
		 and behind some crates.
		-Now there were _screams_ coming from the ship, and someone yelling, "It's free! It's free!
		 Abandon ship!"
		-In short order, one of the sailors ran down the ramp and onto the dock. Another even lept
		 down from the poop deck, but landed badly and wasn't moving.
		-I sheathed my rapier and then ran up to the one by the ramp, shouting, "I heard the
		 commotion! What's going on here? Do you need help?"
			-He responded with jumbled, panicked shouting, saying something about "the fog" and "It's
			 loose!"
			 "What's loose?!?"
			 "Fuckin' spider thing!"
		-More crew fled the ship, and eventually the fog cleared, revealing Larix and a horrible
		 spider-thing, with waving. . . tendrils.
		-The monster didn't seem hostile towards Larix, though, exhibiting a kind of deference to
		 him as he spoke to it in a language I did not understand.
		-This chaos had caught the attention of a couple of guards, who were running towards the
		 monster (and visibly pissing it off).
		-I rushed to intervene, shouting, "Guards! These men have been smuggling monsters into the
		 city, aboard their hired ship! My friend has control over it for the moment, but you must
		 apprehend them!"
		-They seemed to buy it, and Larix tried to convince them to back off, that he had it under
		 control, but they instead shouted something about putting it out to sea, and tried to undo
		 the ramp (that I sabotaged).
		-That pissed the spider-thing right off, though, them approaching. Larix tried to calm it,
		 but to no avail, and it grabbed the guards with it's tendrils, shaking them to death.
		-It then looked over back at Larix, like a dog proud of the bird it caught as the limp
		 guards dangled from it's tendrils.
		-Larix asked that I help him get one of the ship's boats overboard. I lowerd it with it's
		 winch, and then he coaxed the beast overboard, and into it, rowing out into the bay.
			-While doing it, I asked him where Varani was, and he said he saw her breath her last.
		-Meanwhile, we saw some further off guards apprehend Soller, at least, and a few of his men.
		 With the boat in the water, I went over to tell our story.
			-As I approached, Soller was receiving some rough treatment. It seems he was known to
			 them, as one said to another, "This thug has been evading us for a long time. He's off
			 to the dungeons."
				-Another also mentioned something about having aprehended about half of the men they
				 saw fleeing.
			-I volunteered that we were here as agents of the ship's owner, having heard unsavory
			 things about what was going on aboard. We were here to investigate, having boarded the
			 ship only to hear shouting and chaos from below, apparently their smuggled monster
			 getting loose.
				-They were willing to accept that, and to let us take control of the ship. I didn't
				 mention the owners name, but the guards did ask _my_ name. Too proud to do otherwise,
				 I told them Fredrick had this under control, and that I'd let the ships owner know
				 her property had been secured.
		-A short while later Larix returned, wounded, but saying the monster was now free and outside
		 of the city.
		-I let him know we'd met with great success. He agreed, stating he had the ring and a pouch
		 of coin too. The ring had a strange note tucked inside it.
		-With the ship secured, I searched it further, while he kept watch.
		-I then went in search of a runner, and paid him to go fetch Lady Lavinia.
		-A short while later, she indeed arrived, at the center of a party of hired guards.
			-One of those guards stood out, with spiked hair and wearing flowing robes.
				-We later learned his name was Forcas (Lesley's new character).
			-I called down to her, saying that we'd recovered the ring, fee, and boat all!
			-She was elated, though I also had to add that it was not without cost, as Varani did
			 not make it.
				-"We'll of course need to take her share to her family," I bluffed, to which the
				 lady agreed.
	-She had her guards take control of the ship, and asked us to join her in her hired carriage, 
	 where she spoke of further work, on retainer.
	-First, though, she wished us to come with her to her family's vault, in the city's fortress,
	 which the signet ring is key to.
		-To collect our pay, she said, though she also mentioned the vaults had some kind of
		 security, and that she'd like "seasoned adventurers" with her.
	-We traveled a mile or so across the city, and then took a ferry to the fortress's island.
		-It was a looming, forboding thing.
		-We unlocked her family vault, and it would see her fears were not unwarranted as some kind
		 of metallic cobra slithered out from the shadows within.
		-Forcas quickly lept at it, pummeling it with his fists and elbows.
		-I, meanwhile, stepped back, in front of the lady, and manifested my Force Screen.
		-We then took turns failing to harm it, while Larix summoned a wolf.
		-Larix eventually noticed it was lunging at everyone _but_ Lavinia. He pointed out as much,
		 suggesting it was another thing keyed to the ring.
		-She brandished the ring, and it soon backed off, slithering into some kind of hole.
		-Venturing into the next room, it was covered in various panels depicting different monsters
		 in threatening poses.
			-None matching the ones on the note, though. Hmm. . .
			-In the center, a piller stood, with a star emblem around it's top with one marked spike.
			 It was possible to rotate it, pointing the marked spike at the different images.
			-They _did_ each have a different number of eyes, though, I noticed. Once I pointed that
			 out, we turned the pillar to point to one eye, two eyes, etc., until, with the last,
			 the panels opened, revealing a vault behind each.
			-Most were empty of all but a few scattered coppers on the floor, but one contained
			 several still-full chests, and a bunch of paperwork.
			-We were paid out from that.
				-500 gp. to Larix and I (two shares each, due to Varani's share and Forcas's asceticism).


TODO:
	-(DONE) Level up to 2!
	-Write up the loot in some fashion.
		-Figure out the Fantasy Grounds party sheet inventory?
			-Varani's loot is in there.
		-(DONE) Or just do another spreadsheet?
			-Yeah, we decided to just to that, as only the DM seems to be able to do much with the
			 Party Sheet thing.
			-You and Joe recorded all cash already.
			-You created the spreadsheet and posted it. 
		-(DONE) You probably want to use some of that gear too.
			-Buckler?
			-Consumables?
			-Yep, both of the above. You put your name on stuff in the sheet, now update Roll20.


1/26/22:
	-As we left the vaults, Lavinia asked the clerk if anyone else had recently been in her family's
	 vault.
		-After checking his records, the clerk responded that one Vanthus Vanderborn had been inside
		 less than a month ago.
		-Lavinia reacted with surprise, saying, "My brother? He's been missing! He was her? Where did
		 he go?"
		 "We do not keep records of where our visitors go from here."
		-I started to ask about her brother but Lavinia said, "Not here. It's a long story, and
		 painful. . . Return with me in the coach, to my mansion, and we will discuss it further."
	-Back at the mansion, her gnomish servant greeted the lot of us, and also informed the lady that
	 she had a visitor, one Jade Shadowfeather (Shroud's artificer).
		-We each grabbed a drink, and then went to a sitting room, where Jade waited.
		-There, she told us the story of her brother.
			-Once extremely close, her brother has been missing for more than a month. Though
			 apparently he was close enough to empty the vaults. . .
			-The two of them had been separated for 5 years, after some youthful trouble, her sent
			 to a finishing school, and him to the family's country house.
			-Upon their return to the city, their rapport was gone, and he was behaving strangely.
				-He spent his days shut up in his room, only leaving at night, to go out into the
				 city, bringing back. . . disreputable men.
				-Eventually, he struck out on his own, leaving the family's home.
				-Some time after that, their parents' accident occurred. He returned for a bit, then,
				 but behaved worse and worse, eventually striking his sister, after which she cast
				 him out of the house.
	-She then raised the prospect of that further work: finding her brother, and bringing him back
	 to the mansion, to talk some sense into him.
		-Asking her what she knew of his whereabouts, she said he'd not been seen in the Noble
		 or Champion districts, where they have many friends, but that she'd heard he may have been
		 involved with a woman in the Azure district.
		-We agreed to aid her in this, and she, drinking heavily through the whole story, was soon
		 off to bed while we made our introductions to Jade.
	-I proposed we start with the mansion's servants. She'd said it they'd mentioned strange behavior
	 on his part, and maybe there's more to that then they wanted to tell his sister, the lady of the
	 house.
		-Talking with them, the reinforced the lady's narrative, and also mentioned many of his
		 companions sharing an odd tattoo, a hooded snake, though they didn't see the whole thing
		 on any of them, as it was invariably covered partly by clothes.
	-Larix then raised the matter of the hastily bandaged lacerations, and we asked after rooms in
	 the mansion for him to rest.
		-Jade remained with hime, while Forcas and I set out into the Azure district, to see what
		 the word on the street was, if anyone was talking about the snake-tattoo folks, or a noble
		 slumming it.
		-After a short bar crawl, we ran into a couple of folks who seemed to recognize our
		 description of Vanthus.
			-They all mentioned he'd been seen with Brisa Santos, a notorious pick pocket turned
			 artist. Neither had been seen in the district in most of a month, though.
			-We asked if they knew where she stayed, and one said, "Probably in those froofy artist
			 lofts that are popping up all over The Shadow Shore since the area started cleaning up."
		-So, that's the direction we headed.
			-There, Forcas spotted a couple of folks with the snake tattoos.
			-We saw one leaving a bar, and stepped inside, to ask about the man who wore it.
			-We learned from the bartender that the man, name unknown to him, was a regular, and
			 pissed that one Penkus, also a regular, owed him money, and hadn't been seen in some
			 time.
		-After I finished a strong ale, we headed back to the ferry, to worry about the rest of this
		 with the others in tow.
	-I took a moment after waking to talk Forcas into schlepping my junk about for me ("You look
	 strong. It's kind of even an act of charity!").
		-Good bye, encumbrance!
	-We headed back to The Shadow Shore the next morning, in search of Penkus, or at least someone
	 who knows who he owed money to.
		-We ran into a friend of Penkus in a restaurant nearby. He mentioned that he'd last seen
		 Penkus on a boat, a pleasure craft named It Still Floats, owned by a pessimistic dwarf
		 named Panchi. Penkus and Panchi had been arguing about something when this guy left for
		 the shore.
		-We stopped by Panchi's shop.
			-Apparently Penkus had rented It Still Floats, loaded it with lamp oil, lanterns, and
			 rope and then headed West.
			-Further, he was not alone, and had some "long haired, goateed noble" with him. . .
			-He requested that, if we see his ship, we send it his way, or at least salvage it's
			 enchanted propulsion.
	-We decided to take our ship to find that ship.
		-But first, we opted to stop by the Merchant district, to pick up some supplies for Jade to
		 craft me a rapier.
		-While in line at a stall, though, we noticed someone with a snake tattoo behind us in line.
			-I walked right up to him, asking him where he got the fancy tattoo, claiming I was, 
			 "Thinking of getting one myself, after seeing one on someone next to me in a Shadow
			 Shore bar."
			-Looking at it closer as I approached, though, it seemed. . . unfinished, or maybe fake.
			-He dodged that question, and instead launched into a pitch for some kind of party, if
			 we'd pay him the entrance fee.
				-Some kind of island art gallery experience shit, though, he eventually also
				 mentioned something about, "Smuggling the art back into the city. You'll be rich!"
				-What piqued my interest was his mention of the artist, Vanthus.
				-He also introduced himself as Chefton.
				-Well, I guess we're playing along with this harebrained scheme.
	-We boarded _his_ ship instead, and we sailed to a nearby island.
		-It had high cliffs surrounding it, save for a narrow beach.
		-After beaching the ship, he led us to a door in the cliff face, indicating that the
		 "exhibit" was inside.
		-He was reluctant to go in himself, but Forcas beat me to insisting, and he eventually
		 complied and led us inside.
		-Inside only a short while, though, the door was slammed behind us, with clearly-Vanthus
		 laughing and shouting from outside, "You actually fell for it?!? Did my sister send you?"
		-It was followed by the sound of rocks falling outside the door, which no longer budged.
		-Chefton, meanwhile, was shouting back, "You bastard! You trapped me in here with them!"
		-After some nicer-than-I-would have been questions from Forcas, Chefton said something
		 about these being old smuggling tunnels.
		-Well, fuck it, lets see where these go.
		-To half-flooded tunnels full of zombies, it turns out!
		-That. . . went poorly, and now Larix is dead from a thorough zombie gnawing.
		-Forcas was down too, but the bleeding had stopp, so Jade wracked her brain for stuff she
		 could throw together to heal him.
			-It took a couple of minutes and lots of improvising, but she managed to put together an
			 enchanted trinket that healed a few of his bites, getting him back on his feat.
		-I'd seen a fair amount of the tunnels, as I boldly scouted ahead for an escape route during
		 the fight. During that, we spotted a body in a pool of water.
			-We debated fishing it out, and it did have a fancy looking dagger strapped to it's belt.
			-There were some fierce looking crabs in the water, though, so we figured it would be
			 best to rest a bit before we risk provoking them.
			-Before resting, though, Jade wanted to try another healing trinket. However, as she was
			 assembling it and mumbling incantations, it exploded on her, and she went down, bleeding.
			-Well, shit. Forcas and I frantically tried to staunch the bleeding, and he was eventually
			 successful.
			-We dragged her back to the entry room, to hole up with Chefton while we rested a bit.
			-He was a despondent mess, unresponsive as Forcas called him over to help drag Jade, but
			 Forcas slapped him around until he helped.
			-We rested a while, and Jade eventually woke up.
			-I also eventually noticed a change in the sound of the lapping water, and I suspected
			 that low tide may have arrived, perhaps aiding in our escape from this place.


TODO:
	-Come back to that floating corpse.
	-Chat up Chefton, to Diplomacy-adjust his attitude towards us.


2/10/22:
	-As I did more looking into our predicament, examining the shaft by which we entered this place,
	 I felt a familiar presence, watching me. . .
	-I returned to the room where the rest of us rested, to alert the others to this, only for my
	 report to be interrupted by the miraculous appearance of a priest.
	-He introduced himself as Isaias, a follower of Shawn. Sounds like The Brotherhood thought we
	 needed rescuing.
		-I asked him if he could teleport us out of here, but he said no, it was a one-way trip.
		-I also said it sounds like someone doesn't like him, being teleported here just to be
		 trapped same as us, but he said it was his "chance to prove myself."
			-Me: "Tests, eh? I know all about tests. . ."
	-With him now with us, we returned to the room we fought those zombies in, to check on the water
	 there (and check the pockets of that floating corpse).
		-The water level had indeed dropped with the tide, but not so far as to leave any unflooded
		 opening.
			-Jade was weirdly willing to blindly swim an underwater tunnel, but I wisely suggested
			 we look through the rest of the place first.
		-I walked over to the pool, hoping I could snag the corpse with my bowstave, but a monstrous
		 crab emerged from the pool snapping at me, soon joined by several more.
		-I and the wounded Forcas got the hell out of there, retreating to the back of the room, but
		 the priest proved a real fanatic, and ran at them brandishing his weapon.
			-He soon had crabs hanging off him.
		-Crabs are apparently not confused by summersaults, but I can at least out run them. I tried
		 to kite one of the crabs, with mixed success.
		-In less than a minute, though, all the crabs were seafood, and none of us were pinched to
		 death!
	-Afterwards, Forcas immolated the human bodies in the room, "To give them a dignified end."
		-I asked if it was sacrilegious to also "immolate" the crab remains!
		-Turns out not, so we spent the next hour or so on a crab feast.
		-I even called Clifton over, and offered him some.
			-Chatting with him for a bit, he seemed to be warming up to us, but still despondent
			 about how he ended up down here, and not very hopeful about escape.
		-During this time, though, the pool of water began to rise again.
	-Following the feast, we examined the door to the West (shit, should have chosen the rhyming
	 East!).
		-Neither I nor the cleric of apparently unusual abilities noticed any traps, but he did
		 did say he heard through it the moaning of the damned-and-undead.
		-Well, despite our previous zombie disaster, with a priest by our side we felt a bit more
		 confident, and I boldy let Isaias go first.
		-That confidence in Isaias seemed well placed, as the zombies fled before the holy symbol
		 he brandished.
		-The passage they fled down was flooded not far past the door, though. It wasn't deep, but
		 it _was_ pulsing with the waves, and slippery, so it proved slow and treacherous going.
		-Too treacherous for Forcas, as it turned out. His repeated failures led to him nearly
		 drowning in a foot or two of water, with Jade and I stuck behind his flailing form in the
		 narrow corridor.
		-Yep, whole thing was a disaster. All of us fell a time or two, and are now resolved to
		 avoid that damned place until low tide again.
		-At least we managed to kill the zombies one by one, as they made their own way back out of
		 the surf towards us.
	-We opted to rest again, owing to the bruises all over Forcas and Isaias.
	-Eight or so hours later, we ventured out of our barricaded corridor.
	-It seemed now to be low tide, so we again braved the flooded corridor.
	-This time, it was a breeze, being mostly dry.
	-At the end of it, we found a room with the corpse of one Penkus, as identified by a vengeful
	 note clutched in his hand.
		-Apparently, Vanthus betrayed him too, trapping him here where he died a slow death from an
		 infected zombie bite.
		-It even told us where he makes his home, "in the lap o' th'Lotus, below th'Taxidermist's
		 Hall.
			-Penkus had a tatoo with a dragon twining around a flower, and the note seemed to

			 suggest that "the Lotus" is some kind of gang.
			-It also made reference to "the Lady of the Lotus" and Vanthus's "designs" on her.
		-Forcas even found a secret room, filled with genuine pirate treasure!
			-Various potions and other arcana, along with enough coins that we had to drag a sea
			 chest full of them with us.
	-Returning to the crab chamber, we checked the rest of it's doors.
		-Two led to closets, one of which had some useful scrolls at the bottom of some moldy old
		 supplies.
		-The third, though, was the series of rooms I'd previously run through, which we followed to
		 another door, leading away, rather than back to the entrance.
			-This one had the sound of more zombie groans coming from it, so we paused to prepare
			 (and for the end of the session.)


2/25/22:
	-We pawed through some of of loot, distributing useful items, before opening the door.
	-Suitably attired, we kicked in the door, revealing two zombies and some armored undead figure
	 who could manage complete sentences.
	-Isaias ran in, brandishing his holy symbol, but his god seems to have failed him as the zombies
	 were undeterred.
	-I had unwisely followed him down the hall, lunging at one of the zombies, only to miss.
	-When the zombie retaliated, swiping at me with his arm, I decided to make a strategic retreat.
	-Isaias was thankfully better with a dagger than a prayer, and between him and Forcas, one of the
	 zombies was soon looking rough (well, rough_er_).
	-It soon fell apart, and we moved onto the other undead creature, apparently a cleric from what
	 he was casting on his fellows in between harranguing us about "embracing death".
	-This one Isaias _did_ convince to flee with his holy symbol, prompting me to attempt to embed a
	 dagger in his back, but I missed as Forcas stuck a foot out and the cleric-creature went
	 sprawling.
	-Jade then finished him off with a crossbow.
	-Examining the cleric's holy symbol, Isaias deemed him a cleric of Olidammara.
		-I examined the symbol too, deeming it worth about 50 gp., for the weight of the gold.
	-The hallway ended in another pool of water, one Forcas was bold enough to wade into, looking
	 for another way out, and he emerged with some kind of shining orb!
		-Seems like it's somehow magical and, even better, likely valuable!
		-Isaias thought it might be tied to The Brotherhood.
		-Jade confirmed that, saying it's various divets were related to the keys to the various
		 planes of The Brotherhood.
	-A door off the halway led to a vile smelling room, containing a defiled alter.
		-Once dedicated to Olidammara, it was draped in dismembered corpses, perhaps a stage in the
		 cleric-zombie's conversion. . .
	-With that, we'd checked everywhere down here, and the flooded tunnel seemed our only bet for a
	 way out.
	-Well, I'm no swimmer, but _did_ have that Elixer of Swimming, so I chugged it while Forcas was
	 saying something about a rope.
		-After drinking it, I moved about in the water a bit, and seeing how I glided through it, I
		 volunteered to swim the tunnel trailing a rope in my hand, to aid the less elixed.
		-I got to the mouth of the tunnel, but caught myself on the spine of something in the coral
		 at the mouth. I could suddenly feel all that crab meat sitting poorly in my stomach, but
		 pushed through it, swimming up and breaching the surface of the water.
		-Around me, to my surprise, was Sasserine, I having emerged in one of it's rivers. An old
		 smuggling tunnel, perhaps.
		-I gave a tug on the rope, signalling the rest of the party to give it a shot, and Jade soon
		 emerged from the water too.
		-After that, though, the strands of red began to drift through the water. . .
		-I dove in, soon followed by Jade, to help what turned out to be a strugling Chefton,
		 bleeding from the coral.
			-We tried, along with some help from Isaias who followed Chefton down the tunnel, but
			 we were unable to drag him from the water.
			-Forcas eventually pushed him from the tunnel and swam up with him, but we were unable
			 to revive the poor bastard.
	-We were back in town at least. Probably don't want Vanthus or any of his gang realizing that,
	 though.
		-As such, we asked Isaias, who'd not been here when we left town, to go fetch some cloaks
		 to conceal us, and to find the nearest in.
			-Jade chimed in with a recommendation for the latter, saying there was actually one on
			 the nearby bridge.
		-We spent the meantime hiding beneath the bridge, hoping to stay out of sight.
		-While wringing out my bedroll though, I turned my back on Forcas and, when I turned back
		 around, he was gone.
			-Jade and I spotted him down the street, handing out coins to beggers. Fuck.
			-Well, _I'm_ staying out of sight, at least.
		-Isaias eventually returned with a set of too-nice-for-our-purposes cloaks.
			-He also came back with tales of the elven clothier offering some kind of "better
			 mithril", a kind of woven metal, that they were offering.
				-Light armor made from it would cost 1,500 gp. more than usual.
		-With his return, I _strongly_ suggested to Forcas that he perhaps sleep out on the street,
		 as he'd suggested instead of the inn, after all. People are bound to be following him after
		 that display. . .
			-He assented, arranging a time to meet us outside the inn.
		-Isaias then got he, Jade, and I rooms at the inn, which we entered cloaked.
	-After resting, we discussed our next course of action.
		-The three of us agreed that, well, Lavinia was paying us (some? all?), and had asked us to
		 report to her when her brother was found. Might as well do as she asked.
		-The estate was likely watched, though, so we again made Isaias our messenger (and ended the
		 session there).


3/9/22:
	-While we discussed our next move, a young elf unknown to us approached our table at the inn.
		-She remained silent for an awkward moment, looking us over.
		-Eventually, Jade asked, "Yes? Do you need something?"
		 "Yes. I think Lady Vanderborn sent me to find you.
		 "Oh?" I responded, "Did she tell you our names?"
		 "She did. She sent me in search of Forcas, Fredrick, Larix, and Jade, worried she'd not
		  heard from them in some time."
		 "Ah! Good to hear it! I'm Fredrick! Fred the Red, the call me."
		 "I'm Jade. Pleased to meet you."
		 "Forcas."
		-Well, that allays my suspicions somewhat, at least, since I don't think these Lotus jerks
		 ever heard our names.
		-She introduced herself as Kiani, and said she too was in Lady Lavinia's employ, sent at the
		 moment to check up on us.
		-We let her know we were waiting on an ally, sent as messenger to Lady Lavinia just moments
		 ago, and she asked if she could wait with us.
	-An hour or so later, Isaias returned, having met with Lady Lavinia.
		-He said she'd agreed her brother's crimes were dire, and gave us some amount of license to
		 deal with the matter ourselves, since the penalty the city's courts would likely hand down
		 would be death anyways.
		-He also said we might want to check on our ship, saying he'd heard the harbor master had
		 been killed, and that there'd been a "change of management".
			-In fact, Isaias also reported that law and order in the city appeared to be generally
			 breaking down, with criminal activity soaring.
	-Well, I, at least, am rather fond of that ship, and said as much. All agreed we should head
	 there quickly, though Isais warned we should also come prepared, so we opted to unload our loot
	 and do some shopping.
		-At "The Tinker's Toolchest" we unloaded that junk, and perused some more, though nothing
		 really caught my eye.
	-We then headed down to the docks.
		-Along the way, someone sent us a very literal message, trying to tuck a note into Kiani's
		 pocket, though we caught the messenger.
		-No Lotus Dragon member, Kiani and Forcas gave him some gold in response to his sob story,
		 and also in exchange for information about where the message came from, describing a man
		 named Nemien at the taxidermist's guild.
		-As we approached the docks, we found them unusually empty, with almost no one out on the
		 street and the sounds of battle coming from somewhere above, amidst the airship docks.
		-It also sounded awfully windy up there, despite the day being otherwise calm.
		-As we approached closer, I could also hear words on the wind, in Auran: "Flee."
		-We speculated that a ship's air elemental may have gotten free, and pressed on, finding,
		 up top, several Lotus Dragon members in combat with some air elementals.
		-We joined that fun, picking off the busy gang members.
		-We made quick work of the gang members, with the last three surrendering to us.
		-When one of the air elementals turned and swung at Jade, I was able to convince them we
		 were friends, after the men they were fighting.
			-After the the remaining gang members surrendered, the surviving elemental and I spoke,
			 it telling a tale of escape from imprisonment in a crate, and it's desire to be free in
			 the air. We parted in peace.
		-The captives begged for their lives and freedom, which we demanded information in exchange
		 for it.
			-They were able to detail two entrances to the Lotus hideout: a trap door beneath a
			 chest in a backroom of the taxidermist guild and a passageway from beneath a pier.
		-With that info in hand, Forcas also insisted on one more concession: service. He insisted
		 that they join us aboard our ship, as sailors. Service to redeem them, and a way out of the
		 city where they're now in grave danger, after revealing their former comrades secrets.
	-We then headed to the taxidermist guild.
		-It was late by this point, and the front door was locked.
		-Looking below, for the entrance beneath the pier it sat on, we could see that the tide was
		 in, filling the area beneath with water.
		-Not confident of our swimming after the sea caves, I spent some time trying to pick the
		 front door, but a gang front uses an unsurprisingly good lock and I was unable to get the
		 door open.
	-We opted to return the ship, rest, and wait until the printed business hours.
		-During the night, though, we were woken by Forcas.
		-Apparently a relief party had arrived for the gang members we fought, and a disguised Isais
		 had gone out to talk with them.
		-Isaias joined us a few moments later, saying he'd bought some time by telling them that
		 their comrades had gone in search of someone sneaking around the docks. He figured they'd
		 be back soon, though.
		-We set ourselves up in various locations, as an ambush.
			-We indeed managed to get the jump on them, routed them, and then picked them off as they
			 fled, to limit reporting back.


3/23/22:
	-We rested without any further gang members showing up.
	-The following morning, we debated how best to approach the gang's hideout.
	-With the tide lower this morning, we opted for the back door, and sent Isaias and Kiani to rent
	 a boat, their faces still being unknown to the gang.
	-They eventually returned to pick us up in a rented skiff.
	-There seemed to be lots of boats out on the water, and Kiani mentioned that some local fishing
	 contest was today.
		-Convenient, for our purposes. A good reason to be out on the water.
	-Rowing it over to the pier on which the taxidermy guildhall, we could see an iron gate closing
	 off a sea cave beneath it.
		-There was no mechanism for opening the gate from outside of it, though.
		-The bars are wide enough for someone to swim through, but that seemed like a bad idea even
		 before I spotted something shark-like swimming in the water on the other side of the gate.
		-Searching a while longer _did_ turn up some kind of keyhole in the gate, near the water
		 level, but fooling with it attracted the attention of one of the things swimming behind
		 the gate, which thrust a snapping maw up to the gate as I quickly pulled back my hand.
		-With it mere feet away on the othe side of the barrier, now, we figured we ought to take
		 some pot shots, though none hit.
		-That scared this one off, but several others rose, angry, in the water behind the gate,
		 chattering in some language unknown to us.
		-Uh oh. That might be the end of our surprise.
		-Jade named them Ixitxachitl, whatever the fuck that means.
	-Well, that door seems closed to us. Lets try the front.
		-We applied a few spells, and then strolled in the front door.
		-A man in the entryroom greeted us, introducing himself as Nemien.
		-I, in response, announced that we were famous hunters, in the area to do some hunting, and
		 looking to tour the facilities and see examples of the guild's work, to know who to bring
		 our business back to.
		-He agreed to the tour, and began leading us through the this reception area's interior door.
		-Stepping inside there, though, we heard another voice call out, from behind a door in the
		 next room, asking Nemien to come and speak with them, prompting Nemien to say the tour was
		 canceled after all, asking us to leave as he turned to go.
		-Forcas, with a frustrated expression on his face, announced that, "The time for talking is
		 over," and attempted to punch Nemien in the back of the head.
		-He stumbled while doing so, though, and the punch went wide.
		-Nemien, in response, cast a spell and disappeared, followd shortly by the door leading
		 further in opening and closing.
		-We rushed after him, and, as Forcas and Isaias burst through the door he'd passed through,
		 he revealed himself by casting another spell, to unknown effect.
		-Forcas, though, suddenly announced that, "What we're doing here is wrong." He then turned
		 to leave, pushing past us down the hall. . .
		-The rest of us were not so soft-hearted, though. I was still around the corner in the hall,
		 but I heard the thwang of Isaias's crossbow, and Nemien slumping to the floor.
		-I stepped past him as Isaias rifled through his pockets, but Forcas pushed him aside and
		 tried to staunch the flow of blood from Nemien's wound.
			-He seemed less like he's enscrolled, now, though, and more like he's being his self-
			 righteous self.
			-His medical skills weren't up to snuff, but he eventually resorted to pouring a potion
			 down Nemien's throat.
			-What followed, though, was reason enough to not consider Forcas _soft-hearted_ by any
			 means. Nemien woke up after the potion, but Forcas beat him halfway back to
			 unconsciousness while interrogating him.
			-He eventually revealed that there was a secret door in the hallway, leading to the 
			 gang's hideout.
			-Using a key on the ring Isaias took from Nemien, we got the door open while Forcas
			 slammed Nemien's head against a wall until he was unconscious.
	-Passing through the secret door and down a flight of stairs, we found ourselves in a dank
	 cave beneath the structure.
		-Some sentries greeted us through the first door with poisoned crossbow bolts, but we made
		 short work of them.
		-Moving past their corpses, we found ourselves in a maze of tunnels.
		-As we passed one door, we heard a gutteral voice within, complaining of lack of sleep.
			-Turning Isaias and Kiani, I asked, "Count of 3?" and then slowly pushed the door open.
			-Isaias and I each let fly with an arrow, while Kiani cartwheeled in between us, to stab
			 at the wolf-like beast within.
			-It was indeed the source of the voice. It grumbled more about just wanting a nap as it
			 snapped at Kiani's legs.
			-In short order, though, the beast lay bleeding out, with none of us having sustained
			 serious injuries.
		-From there, we followed the tunnels' various twists and turns, fighting the occasional
		 gangers, until we found the kitchen, where a cowering kobold cook pointed us in the
		 direction of Vanthus's room.
		-It proved well locked with a stout door, though, so we turned back to exploring the rest
		 of the tunnels.
		-We rescued a victim of torture, but Forcas was a jerk about the guy being reluctant to
		 discuss his undoubtedly shady business that ended up getting him extorted and eventually
		 tortured by the gang.
			-He shoved Kiani and we ended up beating him unconscious.
			-Forcas wouldn't let the matter of his line of work rest, though, and Kiani was now
			 pissed too.
			-They proceeded to torture the man, effectively waterboarding him.
			-In the course of that, he admitted he was actually a member of this gang, pretending
			 to be one of their victims. He was, in fact, the master of this torture chamber.
			-Well now I'm pissed at him too, since he's not an innocent smuggler or the like, but
			 rather one of the pricks that trapped us in that hole.
			-Forcas wanted to leave him unconscious but alive, to face eventual justice. However,
			 Isaias settled the argument by caving 
		-We never turned up the key to what's supposed to be Vanthus's room, so Isaias and I settled
		 in to very carefully attempt the lock we'd previously failed to pick.
			-Meanwhile, the others went off to examine a pool of water we previously passed by, and
			 returned a few minutes later with tales of a chained up crocodile.
			-Some 20 minutes later, Isaias and I finally got the lock open, and we entered the
			 room. . .


TODO:
	-Level up to 3.


TODO:
	-Get Jade to craft at least a masterwork rapier for you.
	-More dance numbers.
	-Help Jake figure out what Edric has been up to: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/934519433462939659
		-We talked about it here:
			DMJake — Today at 12:46 PM
			Can you give me a few things for Edric over the past 1000 years 
			1. Goals for Material Plane 
				-Crystal epic spell.
			2. Goals for your Plane
				-Heavily urbanized, and a homeland for psionic weirdos.
					-More psionic folks + Bestow Power is also a big deal for Edric, and maybe even
					 an economy.
			3. Goals for your relationship to the Brotherhood of Xul Jarak
			Peaked — Today at 1:07 PM
			OK! I'll think that over.
			Are you in any particular rush? Needing to get this by next session or the like?
			1000 years is longer than I had been imagining, and I'm going to have fun with that if I've got the time.
			DMJake — Today at 1:12 PM
			not in a rush, and I have a system for resolving the timeline 
			I've broken it down into periods of around 3 to 4 hundred years
			Peaked — Today at 1:16 PM
			Since Edric's creation powers work in volumes, I wonder if I can figure out a way to compare that to real figures. Something like, with Edric dedicating X% of his time and Y power points per day, he will have personally replicated Z years of the modern US's industrial output over that millennia. I'm going to have fun with this. . .
	-Once you get Leadership, what cohort should you get?
		-CN Gnome Illusionist?
			-Gnome is definitely solid for an illusionist.
				-+1 to Illusion spell DCs.
				-Alchemy bonus is solid for ships too, furnishing novel alchemical weapons and maybe
				 dovetailing with cannons or more traditional seige weapons.
				-If any gnome, then forest gnome seems a no-brainer. It seemingly only has upsides
				 over the default: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gnomes,_Forest_(Race)
				-Considers himself a "pargon of gnomishness".
			-Sorcerer or wizard?
				-Still Spell, etc.?
				-Charisma also:
					-Is the basis for gnome spell-likes.
					-Helps Disguise, a big-deal skill for illusions (though _you_ also help that a ton).
				-Intelligence also:
					-Helps with alchemy.
				-Variant Illusionist wizards are interesting: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/specialistWizardVariants.htm#chainsofDisbelief
					-Chains of Disbelief is super cool, but maybe actually a downside when working
					 with a ship's crew.
					-Shadow Shaper might be worth the hefty price, given how it dovetails with what
					 you do.
					-Focused Specialist might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#focused-specialist
					-Gnome Illusionist also looks interesting, especially the first two levels:https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#gnome-illusionist
				-Sorcerers have their own variants:
					-This list is super useful: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/variant/variantList.html
					-Illusion Sphere might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#socerer-spheres
					-If religious, there's some fun divine variants:
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#divine-companion
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#domain-access
				-Ah, wizards having Scribe Scroll goes well with your UMD score.
			-Cat familiar's +3 to Move Silently helps someone who casts invisibility, and fits a ship.
			-Interesting applications with ships, especially flying ones.
				-How big can you make illusions? Big enough to hide a ship in a cloud?
					-1st level spell Silent Image is plenty big, with a duration of Concentration!
					-Ah, but can an illusion _follow_ a ship? Silent Image seems to have a static
					 location. _Maybe_ tortured logic would consider a ship a location. . .
			-Illusionist is a great fit for social rogue.
				-Lies + illusions = profit.
				-Invisibility + rogues = death.
				-Eventual Simulacrums are an amazing effect from a cohort: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/simulacrum.htm
