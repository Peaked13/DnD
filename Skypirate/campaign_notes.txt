12/29/21:
	-We're members of a scouting party sent out by The Brotherhood.
		-We were furnished with an airship and sent out to explore The Material, seeking wonders,
		 knowledge, and resources.
		-Larix serves as our helmsman, capable of communicating with the bound air elementals that
		 power the ship.
			-The hull is Edric-built, sailing forth from one of his enormous factory cathedrals, but
			 the service of the elementals was purchased.
			-The "engines" require regular castings of a spell to keep running. A common service, it
			 runs about 50 gp. for our ship, and our engines currently have two weeks of runtime
			 left.
		-Your individual tasking probably resembled this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalndXdxriI
	-After days over the ocean, we came to a kind of port city, newer spires surmounting ancient
	 machinery, and docks below, on the shores of the island this all stands on.
		-Low on supplies, and with Larix assuring us this at least wasn't actively hostile territory,
		 we decided to dock.
		-The city's name proved to be Sasserine.
		-It had recently undergone some kind of change in leadership, "the guilds" having "abandoned
		 the city", with The Dawn Council taking it's place.
			-Indeed, we saw several on the street bearing a sun emblem, along other badges: a
			 lighthouse surrounded by a dragon, a sword with a shield and helmet, a tiger with a
			 rose, and a spider and keep.
		-The city seems to be mostly human.
		-Ruins were frequently in evidence, broken bridges and the like, that seemed to indicate the
		 city had been rebuilt several times.
	-In paying the docking fee, we also heard about a job oppotunity, a lady offering work, and
	 requesting candidates meet her at her estate tomorrow evening.
	-In the meantime, we found a tavern, The Drunken Bear.
		-Talking with the barkeep, we learned more about Lavina. Apparently she'd lost her family
		 in an airship accident, leaving just her and a sibling.
		-The barkeep also seemed none too fond of The Dawn Council, on account of new taxes.
		-She also told us of the city's seven districts:
			-The Champion District, with the arena and other entertainments.
			-The Merchant District, where we docked and were staying.
			-The Cudgel District.
			-The Sun District.
			-The Noble District.
			-The Azure District.
			-The Shadowshore, the one part of the city where the dawn can't reach. . .
		-We also rented a room there.
	-With time to kill, we also checked out the markets of The Merchant District, finding some
	 decent options for resupplying the ship.
	-Varani kept hiding his face when we passed those bearing the emblem of The Dawn Council.
		-I asked him what the deal was and he said someone he'd "rather not talk about" had paid
		 them to capture him.
	-We spent the night at The Drunken Bear.
		-During the early hours of the morning, Varani heard me mumbling in my sleep: "No! No more
		 ink blots. . ."
	-When we woke, Varani was gone.
		-Asking the barkeep, she left about two hours before I came down, and outside there was a
		 lot more Council activity. . .
		-Once Larix woke too, though, he consulted his hawk, who led us to a dead-end alley, and
		 Varani then descended from a hiding place atop some crates and beneath the eaves of a
		 building.
		-Apparently The Dawn Council is looking for her in force, hand she was unable to get back
		 to the bar after going for a run.
	-We decided to find a way to The Shadowshore, and lie low until our dinner tonight.
	-After some quick patches to an abandoned skiff, we took to the water, to cross the lagoon,
	 but opted instead to stop on a deserted, brush-and-trash-strewn island. It seemed a good 
	 hiding spot.
		-Note entirely deserted, as it turned out. I heard the sound of some voices speaking in
		 Goblin somewhere nearby.
		-I crept over and listened in. It seemed they were a party of scrappers, arguing over salvage.
		-Goblins seem generally _tolerated_, if looked down upon, so I decided we should leave them be.
		-There's bigger fish in the water tonight, and no sense showing up to a Lady's house smelling
		 like we'd been rolling around in trash with goblins.
	-As the time came, we headed to our dinner.
		-After knocking, we were ushered inside.
		-A party of armored folks were exiting as we entered. Apparently Lady Lavina has other
		 suitors. . .
			-Varani knew them as a group of mercenaries, "The Jade Ravens".
			-They were talking about being sent to the city of Cauldron, to the South.
		-As we spoke with Lady Lavinia, she spoke of money troubles, a vault beneath a castle, and
		 the two signet rings that can open the vault. Her father's is the only one available, but
		 it's aboard an impounded ship.
			-She paid the fine, but the man holding the ship claims to have never received it, and
			 she suspects he's up to something, aboard the ship.
				-Zolar Vark is his name, and she suspects him of being a smuggler.
			-She asks that we recover her money, and, if possible, find out what he's doing aboard
			 the ship.
				-I haggled for 250 gp. in exchange for the task and she directed us to the ship.
	-Heading there, the ship proved not to be docked, but moored some distance out form the peer.
	-We opted to pretend to fish on our skiff, and keep an eye on ship until midnight at least.
		-No one came or went, and the deck was deserted save a sentry that came out from time to
		 time, but animal noises came from within the hold.
		-We tried climbing the anchor chain, but it. . . did not go well. I was able to play off the
		 noise as a drunk Varani falling while fishing, but we then had to row out of there as the
		 sentry shoed us off.
		-We opted to return another night.
