12/29/21:
	-We're members of a scouting party sent out by The Brotherhood.
		-We were furnished with an airship and sent out to explore The Material, seeking wonders,
		 knowledge, and resources.
		-Larix serves as our helmsman, capable of communicating with the bound air elementals that
		 power the ship.
			-The hull is Edric-built, sailing forth from one of his enormous factory cathedrals, but
			 the service of the elementals was purchased.
			-The "engines" require regular castings of a spell to keep running. A common service, it
			 runs about 50 gp. for our ship, and our engines currently have two weeks of runtime
			 left.
		-Your individual tasking probably resembled this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalndXdxriI
	-After days over the ocean, we came to a kind of port city, newer spires surmounting ancient
	 machinery, and docks below, on the shores of the island this all stands on.
		-Low on supplies, and with Larix assuring us this at least wasn't actively hostile territory,
		 we decided to dock.
		-The city's name proved to be Sasserine.
		-It had recently undergone some kind of change in leadership, "the guilds" having "abandoned
		 the city", with The Dawn Council taking it's place.
			-Indeed, we saw several on the street bearing a sun emblem, along other badges: a
			 lighthouse surrounded by a dragon, a sword with a shield and helmet, a tiger with a
			 rose, and a spider and keep.
		-The city seems to be mostly human.
		-Ruins were frequently in evidence, broken bridges and the like, that seemed to indicate the
		 city had been rebuilt several times.
	-In paying the docking fee, we also heard about a job oppotunity, a lady offering work, and
	 requesting candidates meet her at her estate tomorrow evening.
	-In the meantime, we found a tavern, The Drunken Bear.
		-Talking with the barkeep, we learned more about Lavinia. Apparently she'd lost her family
		 in an airship accident, leaving just her and a sibling.
		-The barkeep also seemed none too fond of The Dawn Council, on account of new taxes.
		-She also told us of the city's seven districts:
			-The Champion District, with the arena and other entertainments.
			-The Merchant District, where we docked and were staying.
			-The Cudgel District.
			-The Sun District.
			-The Noble District.
			-The Azure District.
			-The Shadowshore, the one part of the city where the dawn can't reach. . .
		-We also rented a room there.
	-With time to kill, we also checked out the markets of The Merchant District, finding some
	 decent options for resupplying the ship.
	-Varani kept hiding his face when we passed those bearing the emblem of The Dawn Council.
		-I asked him what the deal was and he said someone he'd "rather not talk about" had paid
		 them to capture him.
	-We spent the night at The Drunken Bear.
		-During the early hours of the morning, Varani heard me mumbling in my sleep: "No! No more
		 ink blots. . ."
	-When we woke, Varani was gone.
		-Asking the barkeep, she left about two hours before I came down, and outside there was a
		 lot more Council activity. . .
		-Once Larix woke too, though, he consulted his hawk, who led us to a dead-end alley, and
		 Varani then descended from a hiding place atop some crates and beneath the eaves of a
		 building.
		-Apparently The Dawn Council is looking for her in force, hand she was unable to get back
		 to the bar after going for a run.
	-We decided to find a way to The Shadowshore, and lie low until our dinner tonight.
	-After some quick patches to an abandoned skiff, we took to the water, to cross the lagoon,
	 but opted instead to stop on a deserted, brush-and-trash-strewn island. It seemed a good 
	 hiding spot.
		-Not entirely deserted, as it turned out. I heard the sound of some voices speaking in
		 Goblin somewhere nearby.
		-I crept over and listened in. It seemed they were a party of scrappers, arguing over salvage.
		-Goblins seem generally _tolerated_, if looked down upon, so I decided we should leave them be.
		-There's bigger fish in the water tonight, and no sense showing up to a lady's house smelling
		 like we'd been rolling around in trash with goblins.
	-As the time came, we headed to our dinner.
		-After knocking, we were ushered inside.
		-A party of armored folks were exiting as we entered. Apparently Lady Lavinia has other
		 suitors. . .
			-Varani knew them as a group of mercenaries, "The Jade Ravens".
			-They were talking about being sent to the city of Cauldron, to the South.
		-As we spoke with Lady Lavinia, she spoke of money troubles, a vault beneath a castle, and
		 the two signet rings that can open the vault. Her father's is the only one available, but
		 it's aboard an impounded ship.
			-She paid the fine, but the man holding the ship claims to have never received it, and
			 she suspects he's up to something, aboard the ship.
				-Soller Vark is his name, and she suspects him of being a smuggler.
			-She asks that we recover her money, and, if possible, find out what he's doing aboard
			 the ship.
				-I haggled for 250 gp. in exchange for the task and she directed us to the ship.
	-Heading there, the ship proved not to be docked, but moored some distance out form the peer.
	-We opted to pretend to fish on our skiff, and keep an eye on ship until midnight at least.
		-No one came or went, and the deck was deserted save a sentry that came out from time to
		 time, but animal noises came from within the hold.
		-We tried climbing the anchor chain, but it. . . did not go well. I was able to play off the
		 noise as a drunk Varani falling while fishing, but we then had to row out of there as the
		 sentry shoed us off.
		-We opted to return another night.


1/12/22:
	-Returning to our own ship to spend the night, given the goons looking for Varani near the inn,
	 we debated our strategy.
	-We didn't come up with anything better, though, and Varani claims she's not normally that clumsy,
	 so we opted to keep watch over the ship for another day, and attempt boarding again after
	 nightfall if we don't catch someone leaving the ship.
	-A little while into the morning, we boarded our skiff and headed out onto the bay to watch the
	 ship.
		-Near nightfall, the ship headed in toward the dock it had been tied to, some distance out.
		-We followed, and as we neared the ship, we could hear them shouting about making the ship
		 ready for departure.
		-We beached the skiff and hurried towards the dock, Larix employing his shapechanger
		 heritage to disguise him as one of the crew.
			-Ducking behind a crate, he tried to hide to cast a spell, summoning a mist to give the
			 rest of us some cover.
			-He was caught in that, but his disguise worked, and he was shoed aboard the departing
			 ship.
		-Varani then tried playing it cool, carrying a random crate aboard, while I crouched behind
		 one still on the docks.
		-Didn't go too well, though. A sentry questioned her, and she then dropped the crate and ran
		 aboard.
		-Well, there's my distraction, so I attempted to sneak aboard myself.
		-Varani threw a punch at one of the thugs, and a brawl ensued.
		-Larix tried his spell again, calling up the mist, but at least one of the sentries began
		 pointing and shouting at him as he did so.
		-With the shit kicking off, I ran into the now-present fog, towards someone shouting from
		 the upper deck on one end of the ship.
			-Hmm. . . I may lie to the lady about what went down here. "Some fight with criminal
			 rivals, no doubt. . ."
		-Hearing some commotion nearby, I crept up on someone stomping around in the fog, only to
		 trip over a length of rope abandoned on deck. Someone began shouting at me to keep back,
		 so I stabbed into the fog with my rapier, but didn't connect with anything.
		-Things went pretty far South. After another vain fog-stabbing, and a legit me-stabbing, I
		 ran the fuck away, back onto the dock and ducking behind a crate..
		-These aren't good odds. I figured I might be able to buy some time, though, and set about
		 sabatoging the ramp running from ship to dock, wedging a stake found on the dock into the
		 rotating mechanism it was locked into. Now, as the ship moved with the waves, it squeals,
		 and probably won't be easily undone.
		-I then made my way towards the seaward end of the ship, where the anchor chain and the
		 docking rope were, aiming to sabatoge those too.
			-I had to take it slow, though, darting from cover to cover, having seen thugs
			 brandishing crossbows on the ship.
		-Meanwhile, the commotion in the fog seemed to intensify. There was some kind of metalic-
		 sounding shrieking, as if from something breaking, and then running and thuds.
		-I got to the anchor and, seeing the quick-release lever for it's winch, leaned over onto
		 the ship, and pulled it, dropping the anchor. I then darted back, further down the dock,
		 and behind some crates.
		-Now there were _screams_ coming from the ship, and someone yelling, "It's free! It's free!
		 Abandon ship!"
		-In short order, one of the sailors ran down the ramp and onto the dock. Another even lept
		 down from the poop deck, but landed badly and wasn't moving.
		-I sheathed my rapier and then ran up to the one by the ramp, shouting, "I heard the
		 commotion! What's going on here? Do you need help?"
			-He responded with jumbled, panicked shouting, saying something about "the fog" and "It's
			 loose!"
			 "What's loose?!?"
			 "Fuckin' spider thing!"
		-More crew fled the ship, and eventually the fog cleared, revealing Larix and a horrible
		 spider-thing, with waving. . . tendrils.
		-The monster didn't seem hostile towards Larix, though, exhibiting a kind of deference to
		 him as he spoke to it in a language I did not understand.
		-This chaos had caught the attention of a couple of guards, who were running towards the
		 monster (and visibly pissing it off).
		-I rushed to intervene, shouting, "Guards! These men have been smuggling monsters into the
		 city, aboard their hired ship! My friend has control over it for the moment, but you must
		 apprehend them!"
		-They seemed to buy it, and Larix tried to convince them to back off, that he had it under
		 control, but they instead shouted something about putting it out to sea, and tried to undo
		 the ramp (that I sabotaged).
		-That pissed the spider-thing right off, though, them approaching. Larix tried to calm it,
		 but to no avail, and it grabbed the guards with it's tendrils, shaking them to death.
		-It then looked over back at Larix, like a dog proud of the bird it caught as the limp
		 guards dangled from it's tendrils.
		-Larix asked that I help him get one of the ship's boats overboard. I lowerd it with it's
		 winch, and then he coaxed the beast overboard, and into it, rowing out into the bay.
			-While doing it, I asked him where Varani was, and he said he saw her breath her last.
		-Meanwhile, we saw some further off guards apprehend Soller, at least, and a few of his men.
		 With the boat in the water, I went over to tell our story.
			-As I approached, Soller was receiving some rough treatment. It seems he was known to
			 them, as one said to another, "This thug has been evading us for a long time. He's off
			 to the dungeons."
				-Another also mentioned something about having aprehended about half of the men they
				 saw fleeing.
			-I volunteered that we were here as agents of the ship's owner, having heard unsavory
			 things about what was going on aboard. We were here to investigate, having boarded the
			 ship only to hear shouting and chaos from below, apparently their smuggled monster
			 getting loose.
				-They were willing to accept that, and to let us take control of the ship. I didn't
				 mention the owners name, but the guards did ask _my_ name. Too proud to do otherwise,
				 I told them Fredrick had this under control, and that I'd let the ships owner know
				 her property had been secured.
		-A short while later Larix returned, wounded, but saying the monster was now free and outside
		 of the city.
		-I let him know we'd met with great success. He agreed, stating he had the ring and a pouch
		 of coin too. The ring had a strange note tucked inside it.
		-With the ship secured, I searched it further, while he kept watch.
		-I then went in search of a runner, and paid him to go fetch Lady Lavinia.
		-A short while later, she indeed arrived, at the center of a party of hired guards.
			-One of those guards stood out, with spiked hair and wearing flowing robes.
				-We later learned his name was Forcas (Lesley's new character).
			-I called down to her, saying that we'd recovered the ring, fee, and boat all!
			-She was elated, though I also had to add that it was not without cost, as Varani did
			 not make it.
				-"We'll of course need to take her share to her family," I bluffed, to which the
				 lady agreed.
	-She had her guards take control of the ship, and asked us to join her in her hired carriage, 
	 where she spoke of further work, on retainer.
	-First, though, she wished us to come with her to her family's vault, in the city's fortress,
	 which the signet ring is key to.
		-To collect our pay, she said, though she also mentioned the vaults had some kind of
		 security, and that she'd like "seasoned adventurers" with her.
	-We traveled a mile or so across the city, and then took a ferry to the fortress's island.
		-It was a looming, forboding thing.
		-We unlocked her family vault, and it would see her fears were not unwarranted as some kind
		 of metallic cobra slithered out from the shadows within.
		-Forcas quickly lept at it, pummeling it with his fists and elbows.
		-I, meanwhile, stepped back, in front of the lady, and manifested my Force Screen.
		-We then took turns failing to harm it, while Larix summoned a wolf.
		-Larix eventually noticed it was lunging at everyone _but_ Lavinia. He pointed out as much,
		 suggesting it was another thing keyed to the ring.
		-She brandished the ring, and it soon backed off, slithering into some kind of hole.
		-Venturing into the next room, it was covered in various panels depicting different monsters
		 in threatening poses.
			-None matching the ones on the note, though. Hmm. . .
			-In the center, a piller stood, with a star emblem around it's top with one marked spike.
			 It was possible to rotate it, pointing the marked spike at the different images.
			-They _did_ each have a different number of eyes, though, I noticed. Once I pointed that
			 out, we turned the pillar to point to one eye, two eyes, etc., until, with the last,
			 the panels opened, revealing a vault behind each.
			-Most were empty of all but a few scattered coppers on the floor, but one contained
			 several still-full chests, and a bunch of paperwork.
			-We were paid out from that.
				-500 gp. to Larix and I (two shares each, due to Varani's share and Forcas's asceticism).


TODO:
	-(DONE) Level up to 2!
	-Write up the loot in some fashion.
		-Figure out the Fantasy Grounds party sheet inventory?
			-Varani's loot is in there.
		-(DONE) Or just do another spreadsheet?
			-Yeah, we decided to just to that, as only the DM seems to be able to do much with the
			 Party Sheet thing.
			-You and Joe recorded all cash already.
			-You created the spreadsheet and posted it. 
		-(DONE) You probably want to use some of that gear too.
			-Buckler?
			-Consumables?
			-Yep, both of the above. You put your name on stuff in the sheet, now update Roll20.


1/26/22:
	-As we left the vaults, Lavinia asked the clerk if anyone else had recently been in her family's
	 vault.
		-After checking his records, the clerk responded that one Vanthus Vanderborn had been inside
		 less than a month ago.
		-Lavinia reacted with surprise, saying, "My brother? He's been missing! He was her? Where did
		 he go?"
		 "We do not keep records of where our visitors go from here."
		-I started to ask about her brother but Lavinia said, "Not here. It's a long story, and
		 painful. . . Return with me in the coach, to my mansion, and we will discuss it further."
	-Back at the mansion, her gnomish servant greeted the lot of us, and also informed the lady that
	 she had a visitor, one Jade Shadowfeather (Shroud's artificer).
		-We each grabbed a drink, and then went to a sitting room, where Jade waited.
		-There, she told us the story of her brother.
			-Once extremely close, her brother has been missing for more than a month. Though
			 apparently he was close enough to empty the vaults. . .
			-The two of them had been separated for 5 years, after some youthful trouble, her sent
			 to a finishing school, and him to the family's country house.
			-Upon their return to the city, their rapport was gone, and he was behaving strangely.
				-He spent his days shut up in his room, only leaving at night, to go out into the
				 city, bringing back. . . disreputable men.
				-Eventually, he struck out on his own, leaving the family's home.
				-Some time after that, their parents' accident occurred. He returned for a bit, then,
				 but behaved worse and worse, eventually striking his sister, after which she cast
				 him out of the house.
	-She then raised the prospect of that further work: finding her brother, and bringing him back
	 to the mansion, to talk some sense into him.
		-Asking her what she knew of his whereabouts, she said he'd not been seen in the Noble
		 or Champion districts, where they have many friends, but that she'd heard he may have been
		 involved with a woman in the Azure district.
		-We agreed to aid her in this, and she, drinking heavily through the whole story, was soon
		 off to bed while we made our introductions to Jade.
	-I proposed we start with the mansion's servants. She'd said it they'd mentioned strange behavior
	 on his part, and maybe there's more to that then they wanted to tell his sister, the lady of the
	 house.
		-Talking with them, the reinforced the lady's narrative, and also mentioned many of his
		 companions sharing an odd tattoo, a hooded snake, though they didn't see the whole thing
		 on any of them, as it was invariably covered partly by clothes.
	-Larix then raised the matter of the hastily bandaged lacerations, and we asked after rooms in
	 the mansion for him to rest.
		-Jade remained with hime, while Forcas and I set out into the Azure district, to see what
		 the word on the street was, if anyone was talking about the snake-tattoo folks, or a noble
		 slumming it.
		-After a short bar crawl, we ran into a couple of folks who seemed to recognize our
		 description of Vanthus.
			-They all mentioned he'd been seen with Brisa Santos, a notorious pick pocket turned
			 artist. Neither had been seen in the district in most of a month, though.
			-We asked if they knew where she stayed, and one said, "Probably in those froofy artist
			 lofts that are popping up all over The Shadow Shore since the area started cleaning up."
		-So, that's the direction we headed.
			-There, Forcas spotted a couple of folks with the snake tattoos.
			-We saw one leaving a bar, and stepped inside, to ask about the man who wore it.
			-We learned from the bartender that the man, name unknown to him, was a regular, and
			 pissed that one Penkus, also a regular, owed him money, and hadn't been seen in some
			 time.
		-After I finished a strong ale, we headed back to the ferry, to worry about the rest of this
		 with the others in tow.
	-I took a moment after waking to talk Forcas into schlepping my junk about for me ("You look
	 strong. It's kind of even an act of charity!").
		-Good bye, encumbrance!
	-We headed back to The Shadow Shore the next morning, in search of Penkus, or at least someone
	 who knows who he owed money to.
		-We ran into a friend of Penkus in a restaurant nearby. He mentioned that he'd last seen
		 Penkus on a boat, a pleasure craft named It Still Floats, owned by a pessimistic dwarf
		 named Panchi. Penkus and Panchi had been arguing about something when this guy left for
		 the shore.
		-We stopped by Panchi's shop.
			-Apparently Penkus had rented It Still Floats, loaded it with lamp oil, lanterns, and
			 rope and then headed West.
			-Further, he was not alone, and had some "long haired, goateed noble" with him. . .
			-He requested that, if we see his ship, we send it his way, or at least salvage it's
			 enchanted propulsion.
	-We decided to take our ship to find that ship.
		-But first, we opted to stop by the Merchant district, to pick up some supplies for Jade to
		 craft me a rapier.
		-While in line at a stall, though, we noticed someone with a snake tattoo behind us in line.
			-I walked right up to him, asking him where he got the fancy tattoo, claiming I was, 
			 "Thinking of getting one myself, after seeing one on someone next to me in a Shadow
			 Shore bar."
			-Looking at it closer as I approached, though, it seemed. . . unfinished, or maybe fake.
			-He dodged that question, and instead launched into a pitch for some kind of party, if
			 we'd pay him the entrance fee.
				-Some kind of island art gallery experience shit, though, he eventually also
				 mentioned something about, "Smuggling the art back into the city. You'll be rich!"
				-What piqued my interest was his mention of the artist, Vanthus.
				-He also introduced himself as Chefton.
				-Well, I guess we're playing along with this harebrained scheme.
	-We boarded _his_ ship instead, and we sailed to a nearby island.
		-It had high cliffs surrounding it, save for a narrow beach.
		-After beaching the ship, he led us to a door in the cliff face, indicating that the
		 "exhibit" was inside.
		-He was reluctant to go in himself, but Forcas beat me to insisting, and he eventually
		 complied and led us inside.
		-Inside only a short while, though, the door was slammed behind us, with clearly-Vanthus
		 laughing and shouting from outside, "You actually fell for it?!? Did my sister send you?"
		-It was followed by the sound of rocks falling outside the door, which no longer budged.
		-Chefton, meanwhile, was shouting back, "You bastard! You trapped me in here with them!"
		-After some nicer-than-I-would have been questions from Forcas, Chefton said something
		 about these being old smuggling tunnels.
		-Well, fuck it, lets see where these go.
		-To half-flooded tunnels full of zombies, it turns out!
		-That. . . went poorly, and now Larix is dead from a thorough zombie gnawing.
		-Forcas was down too, but the bleeding had stopp, so Jade wracked her brain for stuff she
		 could throw together to heal him.
			-It took a couple of minutes and lots of improvising, but she managed to put together an
			 enchanted trinket that healed a few of his bites, getting him back on his feat.
		-I'd seen a fair amount of the tunnels, as I boldly scouted ahead for an escape route during
		 the fight. During that, we spotted a body in a pool of water.
			-We debated fishing it out, and it did have a fancy looking dagger strapped to it's belt.
			-There were some fierce looking crabs in the water, though, so we figured it would be
			 best to rest a bit before we risk provoking them.
			-Before resting, though, Jade wanted to try another healing trinket. However, as she was
			 assembling it and mumbling incantations, it exploded on her, and she went down, bleeding.
			-Well, shit. Forcas and I frantically tried to staunch the bleeding, and he was eventually
			 successful.
			-We dragged her back to the entry room, to hole up with Chefton while we rested a bit.
			-He was a despondent mess, unresponsive as Forcas called him over to help drag Jade, but
			 Forcas slapped him around until he helped.
			-We rested a while, and Jade eventually woke up.
			-I also eventually noticed a change in the sound of the lapping water, and I suspected
			 that low tide may have arrived, perhaps aiding in our escape from this place.


TODO:
	-Come back to that floating corpse.
	-Chat up Chefton, to Diplomacy-adjust his attitude towards us.


2/10/22:
	-As I did more looking into our predicament, examining the shaft by which we entered this place,
	 I felt a familiar presence, watching me. . .
	-I returned to the room where the rest of us rested, to alert the others to this, only for my
	 report to be interrupted by the miraculous appearance of a priest.
	-He introduced himself as Isaias, a follower of Shawn. Sounds like The Brotherhood thought we
	 needed rescuing.
		-I asked him if he could teleport us out of here, but he said no, it was a one-way trip.
		-I also said it sounds like someone doesn't like him, being teleported here just to be
		 trapped same as us, but he said it was his "chance to prove myself."
			-Me: "Tests, eh? I know all about tests. . ."
	-With him now with us, we returned to the room we fought those zombies in, to check on the water
	 there (and check the pockets of that floating corpse).
		-The water level had indeed dropped with the tide, but not so far as to leave any unflooded
		 opening.
			-Jade was weirdly willing to blindly swim an underwater tunnel, but I wisely suggested
			 we look through the rest of the place first.
		-I walked over to the pool, hoping I could snag the corpse with my bowstave, but a monstrous
		 crab emerged from the pool snapping at me, soon joined by several more.
		-I and the wounded Forcas got the hell out of there, retreating to the back of the room, but
		 the priest proved a real fanatic, and ran at them brandishing his weapon.
			-He soon had crabs hanging off him.
		-Crabs are apparently not confused by summersaults, but I can at least out run them. I tried
		 to kite one of the crabs, with mixed success.
		-In less than a minute, though, all the crabs were seafood, and none of us were pinched to
		 death!
	-Afterwards, Forcas immolated the human bodies in the room, "To give them a dignified end."
		-I asked if it was sacrilegious to also "immolate" the crab remains!
		-Turns out not, so we spent the next hour or so on a crab feast.
		-I even called Clifton over, and offered him some.
			-Chatting with him for a bit, he seemed to be warming up to us, but still despondent
			 about how he ended up down here, and not very hopeful about escape.
		-During this time, though, the pool of water began to rise again.
	-Following the feast, we examined the door to the West (shit, should have chosen the rhyming
	 East!).
		-Neither I nor the cleric of apparently unusual abilities noticed any traps, but he did
		 did say he heard through it the moaning of the damned-and-undead.
		-Well, despite our previous zombie disaster, with a priest by our side we felt a bit more
		 confident, and I boldy let Isaias go first.
		-That confidence in Isaias seemed well placed, as the zombies fled before the holy symbol
		 he brandished.
		-The passage they fled down was flooded not far past the door, though. It wasn't deep, but
		 it _was_ pulsing with the waves, and slippery, so it proved slow and treacherous going.
		-Too treacherous for Forcas, as it turned out. His repeated failures led to him nearly
		 drowning in a foot or two of water, with Jade and I stuck behind his flailing form in the
		 narrow corridor.
		-Yep, whole thing was a disaster. All of us fell a time or two, and are now resolved to
		 avoid that damned place until low tide again.
		-At least we managed to kill the zombies one by one, as they made their own way back out of
		 the surf towards us.
	-We opted to rest again, owing to the bruises all over Forcas and Isaias.
	-Eight or so hours later, we ventured out of our barricaded corridor.
	-It seemed now to be low tide, so we again braved the flooded corridor.
	-This time, it was a breeze, being mostly dry.
	-At the end of it, we found a room with the corpse of one Penkus, as identified by a vengeful
	 note clutched in his hand.
		-Apparently, Vanthus betrayed him too, trapping him here where he died a slow death from an
		 infected zombie bite.
		-It even told us where he makes his home, "in the lap o' th'Lotus, below th'Taxidermist's
		 Hall.
			-Penkus had a tatoo with a dragon twining around a flower, and the note seemed to

			 suggest that "the Lotus" is some kind of gang.
			-It also made reference to "the Lady of the Lotus" and Vanthus's "designs" on her.
		-Forcas even found a secret room, filled with genuine pirate treasure!
			-Various potions and other arcana, along with enough coins that we had to drag a sea
			 chest full of them with us.
	-Returning to the crab chamber, we checked the rest of it's doors.
		-Two led to closets, one of which had some useful scrolls at the bottom of some moldy old
		 supplies.
		-The third, though, was the series of rooms I'd previously run through, which we followed to
		 another door, leading away, rather than back to the entrance.
			-This one had the sound of more zombie groans coming from it, so we paused to prepare
			 (and for the end of the session.)


2/25/22:
	-We pawed through some of of loot, distributing useful items, before opening the door.
	-Suitably attired, we kicked in the door, revealing two zombies and some armored undead figure
	 who could manage complete sentences.
	-Isaias ran in, brandishing his holy symbol, but his god seems to have failed him as the zombies
	 were undeterred.
	-I had unwisely followed him down the hall, lunging at one of the zombies, only to miss.
	-When the zombie retaliated, swiping at me with his arm, I decided to make a strategic retreat.
	-Isaias was thankfully better with a dagger than a prayer, and between him and Forcas, one of the
	 zombies was soon looking rough (well, rough_er_).
	-It soon fell apart, and we moved onto the other undead creature, apparently a cleric from what
	 he was casting on his fellows in between harranguing us about "embracing death".
	-This one Isaias _did_ convince to flee with his holy symbol, prompting me to attempt to embed a
	 dagger in his back, but I missed as Forcas stuck a foot out and the cleric-creature went
	 sprawling.
	-Jade then finished him off with a crossbow.
	-Examining the cleric's holy symbol, Isaias deemed him a cleric of Olidammara.
		-I examined the symbol too, deeming it worth about 50 gp., for the weight of the gold.
	-The hallway ended in another pool of water, one Forcas was bold enough to wade into, looking
	 for another way out, and he emerged with some kind of shining orb!
		-Seems like it's somehow magical and, even better, likely valuable!
		-Isaias thought it might be tied to The Brotherhood.
		-Jade confirmed that, saying it's various divets were related to the keys to the various
		 planes of The Brotherhood.
	-A door off the halway led to a vile smelling room, containing a defiled alter.
		-Once dedicated to Olidammara, it was draped in dismembered corpses, perhaps a stage in the
		 cleric-zombie's conversion. . .
	-With that, we'd checked everywhere down here, and the flooded tunnel seemed our only bet for a
	 way out.
	-Well, I'm no swimmer, but _did_ have that Elixer of Swimming, so I chugged it while Forcas was
	 saying something about a rope.
		-After drinking it, I moved about in the water a bit, and seeing how I glided through it, I
		 volunteered to swim the tunnel trailing a rope in my hand, to aid the less elixed.
		-I got to the mouth of the tunnel, but caught myself on the spine of something in the coral
		 at the mouth. I could suddenly feel all that crab meat sitting poorly in my stomach, but
		 pushed through it, swimming up and breaching the surface of the water.
		-Around me, to my surprise, was Sasserine, I having emerged in one of it's rivers. An old
		 smuggling tunnel, perhaps.
		-I gave a tug on the rope, signalling the rest of the party to give it a shot, and Jade soon
		 emerged from the water too.
		-After that, though, the strands of red began to drift through the water. . .
		-I dove in, soon followed by Jade, to help what turned out to be a strugling Chefton,
		 bleeding from the coral.
			-We tried, along with some help from Isaias who followed Chefton down the tunnel, but
			 we were unable to drag him from the water.
			-Forcas eventually pushed him from the tunnel and swam up with him, but we were unable
			 to revive the poor bastard.
	-We were back in town at least. Probably don't want Vanthus or any of his gang realizing that,
	 though.
		-As such, we asked Isaias, who'd not been here when we left town, to go fetch some cloaks
		 to conceal us, and to find the nearest in.
			-Jade chimed in with a recommendation for the latter, saying there was actually one on
			 the nearby bridge.
		-We spent the meantime hiding beneath the bridge, hoping to stay out of sight.
		-While wringing out my bedroll though, I turned my back on Forcas and, when I turned back
		 around, he was gone.
			-Jade and I spotted him down the street, handing out coins to beggers. Fuck.
			-Well, _I'm_ staying out of sight, at least.
		-Isaias eventually returned with a set of too-nice-for-our-purposes cloaks.
			-He also came back with tales of the elven clothier offering some kind of "better
			 mithril", a kind of woven metal, that they were offering.
				-Light armor made from it would cost 1,500 gp. more than usual.
		-With his return, I _strongly_ suggested to Forcas that he perhaps sleep out on the street,
		 as he'd suggested instead of the inn, after all. People are bound to be following him after
		 that display. . .
			-He assented, arranging a time to meet us outside the inn.
		-Isaias then got he, Jade, and I rooms at the inn, which we entered cloaked.
	-After resting, we discussed our next course of action.
		-The three of us agreed that, well, Lavinia was paying us (some? all?), and had asked us to
		 report to her when her brother was found. Might as well do as she asked.
		-The estate was likely watched, though, so we again made Isaias our messenger (and ended the
		 session there).


3/9/22:
	-While we discussed our next move, a young elf unknown to us approached our table at the inn.
		-She remained silent for an awkward moment, looking us over.
		-Eventually, Jade asked, "Yes? Do you need something?"
		 "Yes. I think Lady Vanderborn sent me to find you.
		 "Oh?" I responded, "Did she tell you our names?"
		 "She did. She sent me in search of Forcas, Fredrick, Larix, and Jade, worried she'd not
		  heard from them in some time."
		 "Ah! Good to hear it! I'm Fredrick! Fred the Red, the call me."
		 "I'm Jade. Pleased to meet you."
		 "Forcas."
		-Well, that allays my suspicions somewhat, at least, since I don't think these Lotus jerks
		 ever heard our names.
		-She introduced herself as Kiani, and said she too was in Lady Lavinia's employ, sent at the
		 moment to check up on us.
		-We let her know we were waiting on an ally, sent as messenger to Lady Lavinia just moments
		 ago, and she asked if she could wait with us.
	-An hour or so later, Isaias returned, having met with Lady Lavinia.
		-He said she'd agreed her brother's crimes were dire, and gave us some amount of license to
		 deal with the matter ourselves, since the penalty the city's courts would likely hand down
		 would be death anyways.
		-He also said we might want to check on our ship, saying he'd heard the harbor master had
		 been killed, and that there'd been a "change of management".
			-In fact, Isaias also reported that law and order in the city appeared to be generally
			 breaking down, with criminal activity soaring.
	-Well, I, at least, am rather fond of that ship, and said as much. All agreed we should head
	 there quickly, though Isaias warned we should also come prepared, so we opted to unload our loot
	 and do some shopping.
		-At "The Tinker's Toolchest" we unloaded that junk, and perused some more, though nothing
		 really caught my eye.
	-We then headed down to the docks.
		-Along the way, someone sent us a very literal message, trying to tuck a note into Kiani's
		 pocket, though we caught the messenger.
		-No Lotus Dragon member, Kiani and Forcas gave him some gold in response to his sob story,
		 and also in exchange for information about where the message came from, describing a man
		 named Nemien at the taxidermist's guild.
		-As we approached the docks, we found them unusually empty, with almost no one out on the
		 street and the sounds of battle coming from somewhere above, amidst the airship docks.
		-It also sounded awfully windy up there, despite the day being otherwise calm.
		-As we approached closer, I could also hear words on the wind, in Auran: "Flee."
		-We speculated that a ship's air elemental may have gotten free, and pressed on, finding,
		 up top, several Lotus Dragon members in combat with some air elementals.
		-We joined that fun, picking off the busy gang members.
		-We made quick work of the gang members, with the last three surrendering to us.
		-When one of the air elementals turned and swung at Jade, I was able to convince them we
		 were friends, after the men they were fighting.
			-After the the remaining gang members surrendered, the surviving elemental and I spoke,
			 it telling a tale of escape from imprisonment in a crate, and it's desire to be free in
			 the air. We parted in peace.
		-The captives begged for their lives and freedom, which we demanded information in exchange
		 for it.
			-They were able to detail two entrances to the Lotus hideout: a trap door beneath a
			 chest in a backroom of the taxidermist guild and a passageway from beneath a pier.
		-With that info in hand, Forcas also insisted on one more concession: service. He insisted
		 that they join us aboard our ship, as sailors. Service to redeem them, and a way out of the
		 city where they're now in grave danger, after revealing their former comrades secrets.
	-We then headed to the taxidermist guild.
		-It was late by this point, and the front door was locked.
		-Looking below, for the entrance beneath the pier it sat on, we could see that the tide was
		 in, filling the area beneath with water.
		-Not confident of our swimming after the sea caves, I spent some time trying to pick the
		 front door, but a gang front uses an unsurprisingly good lock and I was unable to get the
		 door open.
	-We opted to return the ship, rest, and wait until the printed business hours.
		-During the night, though, we were woken by Forcas.
		-Apparently a relief party had arrived for the gang members we fought, and a disguised Isaias
		 had gone out to talk with them.
		-Isaias joined us a few moments later, saying he'd bought some time by telling them that
		 their comrades had gone in search of someone sneaking around the docks. He figured they'd
		 be back soon, though.
		-We set ourselves up in various locations, as an ambush.
			-We indeed managed to get the jump on them, routed them, and then picked them off as they
			 fled, to limit reporting back.


3/23/22:
	-We rested without any further gang members showing up.
	-The following morning, we debated how best to approach the gang's hideout.
	-With the tide lower this morning, we opted for the back door, and sent Isaias and Kiani to rent
	 a boat, their faces still being unknown to the gang.
	-They eventually returned to pick us up in a rented skiff.
	-There seemed to be lots of boats out on the water, and Kiani mentioned that some local fishing
	 contest was today.
		-Convenient, for our purposes. A good reason to be out on the water.
	-Rowing it over to the pier on which the taxidermy guildhall, we could see an iron gate closing
	 off a sea cave beneath it.
		-There was no mechanism for opening the gate from outside of it, though.
		-The bars are wide enough for someone to swim through, but that seemed like a bad idea even
		 before I spotted something shark-like swimming in the water on the other side of the gate.
		-Searching a while longer _did_ turn up some kind of keyhole in the gate, near the water
		 level, but fooling with it attracted the attention of one of the things swimming behind
		 the gate, which thrust a snapping maw up to the gate as I quickly pulled back my hand.
		-With it mere feet away on the othe side of the barrier, now, we figured we ought to take
		 some pot shots, though none hit.
		-That scared this one off, but several others rose, angry, in the water behind the gate,
		 chattering in some language unknown to us.
		-Uh oh. That might be the end of our surprise.
		-Jade named them Ixitxachitl, whatever the fuck that means.
	-Well, that door seems closed to us. Lets try the front.
		-We applied a few spells, and then strolled in the front door.
		-A man in the entryroom greeted us, introducing himself as Nemien.
		-I, in response, announced that we were famous hunters, in the area to do some hunting, and
		 looking to tour the facilities and see examples of the guild's work, to know who to bring
		 our business back to.
		-He agreed to the tour, and began leading us through the this reception area's interior door.
		-Stepping inside there, though, we heard another voice call out, from behind a door in the
		 next room, asking Nemien to come and speak with them, prompting Nemien to say the tour was
		 canceled after all, asking us to leave as he turned to go.
		-Forcas, with a frustrated expression on his face, announced that, "The time for talking is
		 over," and attempted to punch Nemien in the back of the head.
		-He stumbled while doing so, though, and the punch went wide.
		-Nemien, in response, cast a spell and disappeared, followed shortly by the door leading
		 further in opening and closing.
		-We rushed after him, and, as Forcas and Isaias burst through the door he'd passed through,
		 he revealed himself by casting another spell, to unknown effect.
		-Forcas, though, suddenly announced that, "What we're doing here is wrong." He then turned
		 to leave, pushing past us down the hall. . .
		-The rest of us were not so soft-hearted, though. I was still around the corner in the hall,
		 but I heard the thwang of Isaias's crossbow, and Nemien slumping to the floor.
		-I stepped past him as Isaias rifled through his pockets, but Forcas pushed him aside and
		 tried to staunch the flow of blood from Nemien's wound.
			-He seemed less like he's enscrolled, now, though, and more like he's being his self-
			 righteous self.
			-His medical skills weren't up to snuff, but he eventually resorted to pouring a potion
			 down Nemien's throat.
			-What followed, though, was reason enough to not consider Forcas _soft-hearted_ by any
			 means. Nemien woke up after the potion, but Forcas beat him halfway back to
			 unconsciousness while interrogating him.
			-He eventually revealed that there was a secret door in the hallway, leading to the 
			 gang's hideout.
			-Using a key on the ring Isaias took from Nemien, we got the door open while Forcas
			 slammed Nemien's head against a wall until he was unconscious.
	-Passing through the secret door and down a flight of stairs, we found ourselves in a dank
	 cave beneath the structure.
		-Some sentries greeted us through the first door with poisoned crossbow bolts, but we made
		 short work of them.
		-Moving past their corpses, we found ourselves in a maze of tunnels.
		-As we passed one door, we heard a gutteral voice within, complaining of lack of sleep.
			-Turning Isaias and Kiani, I asked, "Count of 3?" and then slowly pushed the door open.
			-Isaias and I each let fly with an arrow, while Kiani cartwheeled in between us, to stab
			 at the wolf-like beast within.
			-It was indeed the source of the voice. It grumbled more about just wanting a nap as it
			 snapped at Kiani's legs.
			-In short order, though, the beast lay bleeding out, with none of us having sustained
			 serious injuries.
		-From there, we followed the tunnels' various twists and turns, fighting the occasional
		 gangers, until we found the kitchen, where a cowering kobold cook pointed us in the
		 direction of Vanthus's room.
		-It proved well locked with a stout door, though, so we turned back to exploring the rest
		 of the tunnels.
		-We rescued a victim of torture, but Forcas was a jerk about the guy being reluctant to
		 discuss his undoubtedly shady business that ended up getting him extorted and eventually
		 tortured by the gang.
			-He shoved Kiani and we ended up beating him unconscious.
			-Forcas wouldn't let the matter of his line of work rest, though, and Kiani was now
			 pissed too.
			-They proceeded to torture the man, effectively waterboarding him.
			-In the course of that, he admitted he was actually a member of this gang, pretending
			 to be one of their victims. He was, in fact, the master of this torture chamber.
			-Well now I'm pissed at him too, since he's not an innocent smuggler or the like, but
			 rather one of the pricks that trapped us in that hole.
			-Forcas wanted to leave him unconscious but alive, to face eventual justice. However,
			 Isaias settled the argument by caving in his skull.
		-We never turned up the key to what's supposed to be Vanthus's room, so Isaias and I settled
		 in to very carefully attempt the lock we'd previously failed to pick.
			-Meanwhile, the others went off to examine a pool of water we previously passed by, and
			 returned a few minutes later with tales of a chained up crocodile.
			-Some 20 minutes later, Isaias and I finally got the lock open, and we entered the
			 room. . .


TODO:
	-(DONE!) Level up to 3.


4/20/22:
	-Over the course of opening the lock, we could hear. . . skittering, on the other side of the
	 door.
	-When the we got the lock open, I counted to three, threw the door open and ducked behind the
	 cover of the doorjamb and adjoining wall.
	-Forcas and Jade shot at something within as Isaias rushed forward, mace raised.
	-I drew my own bow and peeked around the doorway, seeing an enormous spider-thing, of the same
	 species those thugs on Lady Vanderborn's ship had been smuggling.
		-Not hesitating, I shot it right in one of its all too many eyes.
	-Another mace blow from Isaias and crossbow bolt from Jade solved the problem.
	-Isaias then rushed past it's still twitching corpse, chasing after some footsteps in the hall
	 beyond it.
	-I followed, finding Isaias battling a hulking goblinoid zombie. My arrow, though, shot over
	 Isaias's shoulder, didn't so much as slow it down.
	-While we fought the zombie, we heard a rasping voice shout. . . something, from behind a nearby
	 door. 
		-"We". I volunteered to "watch the rear".
	-The door then opened, revealing a reptilian humanoid who leaned forward and swiped at the zombie
	 with a clawed hand.
	-Soon, the zombie was down, and Isaias and Kiani were chatting with the creature.
		-"It wants to parley," Kiani reported.
		-"Does the wyrmtongue work?" I asked the creature.
		 "Yes. I can speak that too, but saw the elves among you."
	-The creature led us through a few more rooms and halls, to a meeting room in which stood a red
	 haired, jade eyed woman.
		-As we filtered into the room, she addressed us, saying, "Ah, _you're_ Lavinia's flunkies.
		 I'm Rowyn."
		-I responded first, saying, "I'm Fred, called The Red." The others followed with similar.
		-"What brings you to my aboad?"
		 "Well," I said, "You know our employer. Surely you know her brother?"
		 "Yes. . . he's a firebrand."
		-That elicited a snort from me.
		-"You've done some impressive work," she continued. "Work for me instead. With my connections
		 and your brass, we can take the whole city for ourselves."
		 "What of Vanthus?" I asked, "Won't he be jealous?"
		 "Jealous, yes. But he'll work with us nonetheless."
		 "Why would you work with someone like him?" Isaias asked.
		 "Isn't it obvious? He provides us with money, of course."
		-She then engaged in an increasingly shouty (on Forcas's part) moral debate with our monk.
			-She argued that obeying an unjust law was no crime, but he was characteristically
			 inflexible.
		-She quickly grew visibly tired of that and, eventually, interrupted Forcas saying, "Clearly
		 you don't know what's good for you. Gut Tugger? Get them!"
	-At that, the reptile thing promptly bit Jade's arm, while Rowyn broke into a song about a lucky
	 outlaw that they both seemed to enjoy.
		-I tried to shut her up, but my arrow struck the wall to her left.
		-Soon, the small chamber was filled with a wild melee.
		-Kiani seemed to recognize what this lizard thing is, and tried speaking further to it in
		 Elvish.
			-Not sure what she said, but it _did_ seem suddenly unsure of itself, taking a step back
			 from the fight.
		-Seeing that, Rowyn's singing faltered, and she instead grabbed a vial from her pocket,
		 downed it, and dissolved into a cloud of green smoke that began to drift towards the hall
		 we came through, moving towards a closed door next to Jade.
		-Forcas blasted her still gaseous self with a burst of luminous energy, also setting the door
		 behind her on fire.
		-That didn't stop her from slipping beneath it, though.
		-Meanwhile, Kiani, and now Isaias too, continued to talk with the lizard in elvish. It seemed
		 agitated, but was at least no longer trying to bite us.
		-Eventually, it handed Kiani a key, taking it from a cord around it's neck.
		-Forcas, Jade, and I raced after the gaseous Rowyn. Jade followed her to a door that turned
		 out to contain a bathchamber, but she'd apparently escaped through an air vent.
		-Returning to the meeting chamber, Gut Tugger was now rather cooperative, and had offered to
		 lead us to the gang's vault, which the aforementioned key opens.
		-He led us a bedroom, and showed us a keyhole concealed at the base of one of the walls.
			-While he was doing that, Kiani and I also rifled through the bedroom (Rowyn's?) fancy
			 perfumes, many of which were quite valueable.
			-We also found a journal, that seemed to belong to Vanthus Vanderborn. Reading through
			 it, he admitted to the murder of his parents, and discussed plans to commit a more ship
			 arson soon, which may be a clue to his whereabouts.
		-Kiani and Gut Tugger then got the hidden door open, though Gut Tugger held her back when
		 she tried to step inside, warning of a trap in the floor. He rushed in to open an empty
		 chest, saying it would disable the mechanism in the floor.
		-There were two more chests in the vault, which Gut Tugger said he did not have the keys to
		 them.
			-After the floor trap, we wanted to be cautious, and Isaias and I both carefully checked
			 the chests for more traps.
			-He claimed them clean, but I pointed out the trigger mechanism for a dart trap on each.
			-A comedy of errors then ensued, in which we both disabled a trap the hard way.
				-I was more confident of my skills and tried to disable the first one, only to get
				 a poison dart for my trouble.
				-Feeling queasy after that, I insisted Isaias take a turn. His luck was no better,
				 but _his_ dart was curteous enough to skip off his armor.
			-The traps at least sprung, Isaias and I took our time getting the locks open, but
			 eventually popped them.
				-One contained assorted loot, clearly from a variety of sources. Coins from many
				 nations, some filthy, some pristine.
				-The other, though, contains gems in bags labeled with the crest of House Vanderborn.
	-Gut Tugger, at least, we were rather happy with here. It and Kiani had a long conversation in
	 Elvish, and she reported that she would be arranging for him to take service with her parents.
	-We opted to rifle through the rest of the guildhall, to make sure we missed nothing more.
		-With Gut Tugger's help, we made short work of that, but there was little else of interest,
		 save four more of the spider monsters, in cages.
		-I thought they might be valuable to the right buyer, but didn't know where to find one and
		 wasn't about to set them free, so we left them.
	-Leaving the guildhall, we headed back to Lady Lavinia's estate.
		-Her housekeeper woke her while we waited.
		-When she joined us, I warned her she might want to sit down for this one and handed her the
		 journal.
		-Jade also brought up the matter of the gems marked with her family crest, eliciting a scowl
		 from me, and Isaias turned them over to her.
		-She was understandbly agrieved to learn her brother was responsible for the deaths of her
		 parents.
		-Her gnome housekeeper comforted her, while Isaias and Forcas both ranted about "the will of
		 the gods", the former aiming to comfort, while the latter shouted about their demand for
		 retribution here, probably canceling out the former.
		-She eventually thanked us for the return of her family's funds, giving us each a bonus of
		 a thousand gp. worth of the gems.
		-She also said that she would inform The Dawn Council about her brother's activities, and
		 of The Lotus Dragons' disarray.
		-Then, Lady Lavinia offered up her estate to us, to rest and recover from our wounds. We
		 spent several days there, recuperating.
	-Over the course of our rest, the council indeed investigated The Lotus Dragons' hideout, and
	 cracked down on them heavily.
	-Jade also took some time to try and track down the kobold that helped us. She thinks she found
	 work as a cook on a ship, but wasn't able to find her to actually speak with her.
	-Finally, towards the end of our week of rest, we received an invitation from The Dawn Council,
	 to a dinner in our honor at The Scarlet Embassy, and place the council maintains for such
	 functions.


TODO:
	-(DONE!) Blank the loot sheet before next session, once everyone has written stuff they claimed down.
	-(DONE!) Shopping! You've got a bit over 5k.
		-4k on Gloves of Dexterity would be a pretty obvious one for you: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gloves_of_Dexterity
			-Yep, and sounds like they're available at list price.
			-Added them to your sheet.


5/4/22
	-A bit of poking at your glamoured chain shirt proved it can indeed replicate any non-magical
	 clothing, including a noble or royal outfit (on your torso, at least). Ready for the ball!
	-I also got drunk with Kiani's lizard pet.
		-Apparently he hadn't tasted wine in a century.
		-Also apparently, he can drink like a champ.
		-We made a wild night of it, starting at the Vanderborn estate, and continuing on at a
		 tavern a dwarf with a four color beard recommended. Though I think he was just trying to
		 get with the bartender, the music was still good.
			-It's called "The Lusty Leper". Or maybe "The Lusty Leopard"? The dwarf's clarification,
			 "The one with the spots," didn't help much. . .
		-We drank with alchemists, Kiani got Gut Tugger a job as the bar's official party lizard,
		 and I name dropped our way out of guards wanting to shut things down due to a noise complaint.
	-Forcas, Isaias, and Jade eventually joined us at the bar, with Forcas saying something about
	 another event that needed livening up.
		-"Oh? Who died?"
		 "This dwarf's brother."
		 ". . . awkward choice of words on my part."
		-Still, I did my best to liven up a funeral, one which helpfully consisted of throwing the
		 deceased possessions into the sea (along with whatever else the drunk crowd following me
		 grabbed along the way).
		-Much drinking and littering ensued.
		-By the end of Isaias's sermon, I was getting more maudlin drunk, and announced, "Everyone I
		 grew up with is gone. . . Not dead, but gone all the same. . ." I followed that by throwing
		 my now empty road beer bottle into the sea.
		 "Yeah, didn't you lose the rest of your original party?" Isaias asked.
		 "Oh yeah, those guys died too. Get me another bottle!"
	-We eventually returned to the Vanderborn estate, a short while before dawn, and I awoke very
	 hung over, the following afternoon.
		-After talking the kitchen into making me a late breakfast of some eggs, Lady Vanderborn
		 also walked us through the expectations and protocols of The Dawn Council ceremony this
		 evening. It earned us each a free rank in Knowledge (Nobility & Royalty).
			-"There are _drinks_ at the party, right?"
			 "Of course," Lady Vanderborn replied, "Though there'll be more of that in afterparties
			 at the estates of various nobles. None here, likely, though, given the impact of
			 Vanthus's actions on our family's reputation."
		-The servents at the estate also bathed a reluctant Forcas at our urging. He cleans up OK,
		 but looked distinctly unhappy about the whole affair.
	-That evening, we all loaded into Lady Vanderborn's carriage, and headed to the party in our
	 honor.
		-It took us a bit to reach the front of a line of carriages winding through The Noble
		 District, but, once at the event, the guards ushered us inside.
		-Just inside the door, we were met by a man in garments emblazoned with a sunburst.
		-He introduced himself as Xavius, the leader of The Dawn Council, and we each introduced
		 ourselves to him in turn.
		-We were then introduced to a variety of wealthy and powerful folks, their faces and names
		 soon a blur.
			-Among them were:
			 Quim - Wine, Thoreous - Waste disposal,  Otso - Woodworker's Guild, Nizol - Fishmonger,
			 Dranthus - Miner's Guild
		-I eventually made a very successful speech, during which Isaias took the opportunity of to
		 cast some kind of spell (he'd requested a distraction from me).
		-In small chit chat thereafter, I did hear rumors of possible work.
			-One man mention that the Miner's Guild was always looking for muscle, and another, one
			 of the nobility, even mentioned he'd love to hire me as the family's envoy.
				-"Well, I am a hit at parties!"
		-Forcas seemed to get angrier and angrier throughout the party, and eventually began
		 scornfully ranting about "the decadence of these so-called nobles."
			-Several of us bluffed our way through calming that situation:
			 "Forcas, your impression is dead on! Isn't he a hoot?"
			-Situation defused.
		-We also met one Maya Dracus, who seemed quite fascinated by us.
			-She was a scion of one of the city's noble houses.
			-House Dracus was an old one, but one which had recently required some ill repute.
			-Oddly, she also asked us about The Morticians' Guild.
				-Ugh. Not a crowd I want anything to do with.
		-A priest of Tyr also really wanted us to come to a service.
			-Pass.
			-He and Forcas started arguing theology.
		-Finally, it was time for the ceremony itself and, after some speechifying by Xavius, we
		 were given medals marked with the spire of Sasserine, designating us honorary delegates of
		 The Dawn Council.
			-It gives +2 circumstance to Diplomacy and Gather Information in Sasserine, but that
			 overlaps with me Marshal bonus, so only really useful for the others, and only when I'm
			 not around.
	-Afterwards, it was afterparty time!
		-After some amount of badgering from me, we led a trail of minor nobility and assorted
		 hangers-on back to Lady Lavinia's estate.
		-Partying ensued.
		-I danced with Lady Lavinia.
		-We also heard more from Maya Dracus, who had followed us to the after party.
			-She wanted to talk more about The Morticians' Guild, claiming there'd been all too few
			 funerals lately. She believed that the bodies were instead being used in dark rituals
			 of some form.
			-She also mentioned that there was a brisk trade in dragon bones lately, which she
			 thought may be ending up in similar rituals.
			-Finally, and the carrot to all this, she thinks they might have had dealings with The
			 Lotus Dragons, and that Vanthus could be hiding with them.
				-_That_ caught my attention. Still want to stab that prick.
	-We were amenable to Maya's deal, her assistance in finding Vanthus in exchange for ours in
	 finding out what's going on with The Guild.
		-We'll start that investigation next session.


5/18/22:
	-We debated how to go about investigating these corrupt cadaver cosmeticians.
		-My idea to drink until someone passes out, and then pass them off as a corpse yielded
		 stares, rather than the expected standing ovation.
		-Maya wasn't willing to disclose her source for these rumors of corruption, but says she
		 trusts them.
			-"Hush-hush then. I see."
	-We decided to disguise Jade as a corpse.
		-I wasn't too sure of the plan here, but it seemed like fun, and Jade was willing. Why
		 the hell not?
		-Did the make up, and did a pretty decent job of it, if I do say so myself.
		-To complete the job, we went to see an alchemist.
			-"Say there, shopkeep, got a potion with which I could fake my own death?"
			 "Why would you want that?"
			 ". . . a surprise party."
			 "That'll be quite the suprise. . ."
			 "Yeah. I can't wait to see the look on Mom's face."
		-We got something that should convincingly paralyze Jade for an hour, an inky black potion.
	-In the course of that, I got a message from Forcas, who'd been watching outside The Morticians'
	 Guild.
		-Apparently people just deliver notes to the guild, indicating where the body is to be found.
		-However, no one seems to leave the guild, not while Forcas was there, and not in days, from
		 what the people he asked said.
		-In return for the delivered message, I bought the urchin that brought it lunch in the nearest
		 tavern.
		-I spent the next three hours there, eating and drinking, but eventually went to find Forcas.
	-On the way to see Forcas, we spotted a 3 ft. long rat in an alley we passed, though it skittered
	 off when we saw it looking at us.
		-Maya said such things aren't exactly indigenous to the city, but that a gang known as The
		 Shapers is rumored to have were-rats among them.
	-When we got to The Morticians' Guild, Forcas was nowhere to be seen.
		-We asked some likely looking homeless men (his crowd) if they'd seen him, and we were told
		 that he had descended into some kind of catacombs.
		-Waiting around an hour or so, Forcas and the man who apparently led him down there, one
		 Josias, came walking back over.
		-Forcas sent Josias off, and then bade us follow him.
			-He asked me for some booze as he went. I shrugged and handed him my half drank road beer.
		-As we walked, Forcas talked.
			-Josias was a apparently once a member of the guild, but it had turned dark after some
			 kind of scaled humanoids started hanging around. An ogre corpse was stolen, and many
			 members were driven off.
				-Their scales apparently came in varied colors, red, white or black. That, to Maya,
				 perhaps said Tiamat and her cult, a god the Bahamut-following noblewoman was none
				 too fond of.
			-Josias also told him how the guild moves around: through the city's catacombs.
				-Apparently there's a locked iron grate leading to the guild down there.
			-While walking, Jade also thought she saw something. . . whiskered, watching us from a
			 rooftop above.
				-She called our attention to it, and Forcas flared bright, but there was nothing up
				 there when we all looked.
		-Forcas led us into the catacombs through a nearby tunnel entrance, it's door wrenched open
		 long ago.
			-Inside, a short distance from the entrance, was the door Forcas had described.
			-I got out my lock picks, but Maya pulled me back, saying she saw a magical aura on the
			 door.
			-After examining it, Jade said it looked like a casting of Arcane Lock.
			-Best we could come up with was buying a scroll of Knock, which Isaias and I went off in
			 search of while the others opted to loiter in a catacomb.
			-With this damned rat-thing lurking about, we opted to move quietly.
			-It was late, but a creepy novelty shop was still opened, and a man with obviously fake
			 vampire teeth got us sorted.
			-Returning in a similarly stealthy fashion, we came upon a melee back at the catacomb
			 entrance.
				-The others were fighting a pair of were-rats and a were-tiger!
				-They were faring poorly, wounds dripping blood, though the tiger was wounded as
				 well.
				-Isaias and I each took careful aim and shot at the tiger, but the arrows soon
				 embedded in him barely seemed to slow him, though it got one of his rat buddies
				 shooting me as I ducked behind a barrel.
				-Two more swipes from the tiger and suddenly Forcas and Maya were on the ground and
				 out of my sight.
				-I tried to kill the were-tiger with my brain and met with some success, but he
				 proved hard headed, and was soon running my way.
				-He managed to catch me, leaping down from a rooftop to give me a nasty scratch,
				 one the soon had me feeling queasy.
				-Fortunately, Forcas began bellowing insults at the beast and I summersaulted back,
				 ducking, turned a corner down an alley, and hid again behind a barrel.
					-Someone must have gotten him back on his feet, and not a moment too soon!
				-The tiger-man ran down the alley past me, thankfully not noticing me (and I was not
				 keen to remind him with an attack of opportunity), and engaged Forcas in melee.
				-I ducked from cover to cover, loosing arrows at the beast, while others joined
				 Forcas in the fray.
				-Sadly, though, Forcas soon lay unmoving at the monster's feet, after a particular
				 grevious swipe nearly severed his arm at the shoulder.
				-Someone out of my sight threw a dagger at the tiger's face and it staggered away
				 from the melee, trying to pull the dagger from it's eye while I loosed another
				 arrow at it and Isaias gave chase.
				-Isaias chased it down a cross street, and I then heard a great thud.
				-I cautiously crept forward, and, rounding the corner, was disappointed to see a 
				 bare-chested _man_ in the torn pants that once wrapped the tiger-beast.
					-Aww. I was was hoping for a rug. . .
				-Oh! I then ran over to check on Forcas, as Isaias called after me, saying, "I saw
				 the light leave his eyes, Fred. . ."
					-As I pulled my hands from Forcas's pockets, I said to our sad and wounded
					 group, ". . . I think I'll miss Forcas most of all, out of my various lost
					 comrades. *sniff* The other's left me so much more to remember them by. . .
					 Well! At least he'll aid us once more even in death: we now have a good reason
					 to talk to The Morticians' Guild!"


TODO:
	-I, and a couple of others, may be cursed. We should probably look into that.
		-Or just embrace being a weretiger?
			-https://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/lycanthrope.htm
			-Shit. It would be a sudden and very different direction for the character, but not that
			 bad. . .
				-+2 LA and 6 racial HD, but the latter are much better than usual due to Phrenic.
					-Reducing LA would come into play when you're level 12: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/races/reducingLevelAdjustments.htm
					-What are the racial HD?
						-Animal? https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#animalType
							-Yeah, "Lycanthropes As Characters" confirms as much.
						-Skills:
							-Skill points: 6*(2+3+1) = 36
							-Class skills: Balance, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, Swim
								-+6 Hide, +6 Move Silently, +2 (4 pts.) Perform (dance), Social?
							-That is pretty crippling, unless you want to just go into being a melee
							 rogue.
				-Would probably mean no Dread Pirate, but Shadowdancer could be your next class level.
					-Next levels:
						10	Shadowdancer 1
						11	Shadowdancer 2
						12	Rogue 3
					-Still, you'd have an underpowered sneak attack and only 3 attacks in a charge,
					 since Rake kicks in the _next_ turn (4 claws on that following turn).
				-Would mean no leadership until late, due to 6 _class_ levels required, and a poor
				 cohort when you get it.
				-Ah, no pounce, grab, or rake in hybrid form.
					-Maybe not a good idea, unless you can be a talking tiger.
			-Would have a weird impact on the game, since you'd suddenly have 9 HD, as well as a +2 LA.
			-It actually makes a lot of flavor-sense. Fred's bitterness over not getting to be an
			 Elan, his conviction he's already a better-than-normal freak, etc.
			-Hmm. . . can always become a tiger _later_. . .
	-Forcas's body?
		-Forment a riot against the Shaper gang that killed him?
			-Real Mark Antony vibes. . .
			-Make a martyred saint of him. They actually attacked him _while he prayed_.
		-Use it for Morticians' Guild shenanigans?
		-Both?


6/1/22:
	-Isaias is apparently well versed in medicine, and explain to us what those of us feeling
	 feverish likely caught: lycanthropy.
		-He explained that the easiest way to deal with it will likely to very quickly obtain some
		 wolfsbane.
		-Maya knew an apothecary that could likely help, The Wildwood Apothecary, over by the arena.
	-There was also the matter of Forcas's body. . .
		-I've got plans for it. . . funeral plans. So we need to hang onto that.
		-Maya mentioned a temple to Wee Jas that the moritician's guild had supplanted, and I also
		 threw out the idea of paying some of the street people to hide it for us.
	-Maya went to go arrange passage on boat, recognizing the house symbol marking one nearby.
		-She made some kind of arrangement with them, trading our eventual help with some problem
		 impacting the harbor.
	-With that set, we then took Forcas to his nearby soup kitchen.
		-They were a bit skeptical of hosting the body in an eatery, but we convinced them.
		-They were suitably agrieved by his loss.
	-That matter settled, we boarded the boat, and made our way towards the arena district.
	-There was some trouble with an overly officious guard at the gate of the district, but Maya
	 sorted that with in typical noble fashion, something that boiled down to, "Do you know who I
	 am?"
	-We found the apothecary and, with both some coin and help looking, we eventually found some
	 wolf's bane in the proprietor's overcrowded storeroom.
		-She also questioned us about why we needed such a thing and we recounted our run in with
		 the Shaper gang.
		-She was familiar with them, and even lamented their take over of some scrublands near the
		 old observatory. She used to gather herbs there, but they now let no one near.
	-We then debated what to do about the late Forcas.
		-Maya thought that, in light of Forcas (and several of the rest of us) having been recently
		 named a "Hero of the City", she could persuade the city's government to facilitate a grand
		 funeral.
	-We were pretty beat up, though, from the tiger fight, and opted to find rest first.
		-We returned to the Vanderborn estate, to rest there.
		-Lady Vanderborn was suitable aggrieved to learn of Forcas's death, and seemed to be
		 developing some doubts about this whole adventurers enterprise, but she also furnish us
		 with some healing potions, to see to our wounds.
	-We returned the following day to the soup kitchen, to see to Forcas's body.
		-It was crowded, and several of my companions stepped in to help distribute food.
		-Standing over the body, though, was a strange looking figure. Emaciated, and dressed in
		 rustic clothing, we asked him if he knew Forcas.
		-"As an easy meal, no more. He was a good person, though, and could have helped the city
		 much."
		-He introduced himself as "Nkondi the Hunter", and he seemed to know much about The
		 Morticians' Guild, saying they had "abandoned the teachings of the founder" and that "they
		 collect the dead for no holy purpose, but for their own purposes".
		-He also had a disturbing habit of talking to his "ancestors".
		-Isaias asked him if he was a follower of Nkisi, a name Nkondi seemed to know. He responded
		 that he was indeed "named for one of the ancestors".
		-There was then a commotion at the door. Robed figures had entered, announcing, "We have
		 come for the body."
		-Maya told them off, but they said they'd return soon.
			-Nkondi claimed they would come with reinforcements.
		-We decided to get Forcas out of there.
	-At Isaias's prompting, we took him to a temple of Shawn, near the arena.
		-We hired a chatty coachman, Havy, who thankfully bought the story that Forcas was drunk.
		-As we pulled up outside the cathedral, I stared a bit at the carvings on the outside while
		 Maya paid the coachman.
			-"Isaias, who did you say this was a temple to again?"
			 "To Shawn, of The Brotherhood."
			 "Ahhh. Um, I might sit this next bit out, go see what's going on at the arena. Meet me
			  over there?"
			 "Uh, sure?"
			 "Great! I'll save you all some seats!"
	-I wandered over to the arena, grabbed a beer, and found a seat in the stands.
		-The weather was good, the beer cheap, and the fights, if a bit uninventive, were decent 
		 entertainment.
		-As a watched, I caught a strange looking stranger eying me.
			-He had a green-ish cast to his skin, and fingers far longer than most humanoids.
		-Being a friendly sort, I raised my mug to him, in toast.
		-In response, he said, "Your mind. . . it is not normal, is it?"
		 "Eh, what's normal? I do like to think of myself as rather sharp, though."
		 "I mean that you have the mark of oppression on you. I have felt similar, for my people
		  were once enslaved by the mindflayers."
		 "Ah, I know what you mean. The one who. . . made me even has friends in this city. It's
		  why I'm here, avoiding them."
		 "I'm here because I would see these barbaric fights stopped. They remind me all too much
		  of the. . . entertainments that my people were once forced to participate in."
		 "I see, I see. Well, best of luck to you in that endeavor!"
		 "And to you in yours. I am called Gith. What is your name?"
		 "Fredrick, called Fred the Red."
		 "Well met, Fred. I will leave you to the. . . games."
	-I was eventually collected by the rest of the party, and we discussed what to do next.
		-They're amenable to my goal of riling up the people against the Shaper Gang, so we went
		 with Maya to talk with the city's government about a state funeral.
		-Lady Vanderborn's letters had already kicked off the process of gathering a quorum of The
		 Dawn Council, and they'd nearly all gathered already by the time that we arrived.
		-They were amenable to providing Forcas a hero's funeral, one lasting from dawn to dusk as
		 is the custom.
		-I asked if there would be an opportunity for me to speak, a eulogy, and they said I could
		 do so in the evening, in front of the court house.
	-We then retired to the Vanderborn estate, all save Nkondi, who stood watch over Forcas's body
	 at the temple.
		-Before we made it to bed, though, a cleric of Shawn arrived at the estate, out of breath,
		 reporting another attempt by The Morticians' Guild to claim the body, though they were
		 still dissuaded with words alone.
		-We returned with him to the temple, and opted to sleep there that night, in case they
		 return.
		-The next morning, I went out for both some breakfast and some rumors, curious about what
		 The Morticians' Guild might attempt.
			-Jade joined me in that, and we came back with reports of one of their robed figures
			 lugging around a large sack, from which emerged a wing (?).
			-Maya _had_ said something about suspecting the guid of trying to raise undead dragons. . .
		-When we came back with that, Maya suggested a potential shield, human and reputational.
		-We arranged a short notice wake/party before the temple, gather all we could with free
		 food and booze plus Maya's connections among the nobles.
			-Quite a crowd gathered and we regaled them with mostly true stories of Forcas's life.
			-It was quite the party, but it did not dissuade those killjoys in The Morticians' Guild.
			-The first sign of that was Jade shouting, "Look!" and pointing at the sky.
			-Circling above, there was indeed a winged shape that, as is swooped down, resolved into
			 a large, undead dragon. What scales it retained were white.
			-We did fierce battle with the creature. It could have gone either way but, after a few
			 moments, a cleric ran out of the nearby temple shouting that help was one the way.
			-The beast then lept into the air, and fled.


TODO:
	-(Done!) Level up!


6/29/22:
	-The beast driven off, the clerics of the temple rushed over to us, tending to our wounds.
	-They asked us if we knew who had attacked the wake, and I leveled the charge at The Morticians'
	 Guild, based on the rumored sack of winged thing Jade and I had heard they were hauling around
	 the streets earlier.
	-We still had three hours still until the official funeral was scheduled, so I figured I'd do
	 what I could to encourage people to return to the wake, and eventually join us for the procession.
		-I reassured those still hiding in the area that the dragon was gone, and encouraged them to
		 return, "To show those corpse-humping necromancers that you're not afraid!"
		-I then turned to the nearby taverns, to rally still more.
		-When I had returned to the temple-front wake, I found that Maya was gone. The others said
		 she'd been called away by a messenger from her family.
	-Eventually, it came time for the processional. A wagon drawn by fine white horses and bedecked
	 in flowers in the shape of an angel came to collect Forcas's body.
	-We and the crowd at the wake followed it, in a raucous mob, gathering still more people as we
	 walked.
	-Eventually, we arrived at the formal headquarters of The Dawn Council and the funeral began,
	 with Forcas lying in state.
		-It opened with a lengthy set of speeches by The Dawn Council's various politicians and
		 noteables, each transparently seeking to use Forcas to promote their own various agendas.
		-Nkondi and I spend much of that time riling up whatever portion of the crowd was in earshot
		 of us, calling for action and disparaging the timid investigations and panels a few of the
		 speaking council members made.
		-Finally, it came time for my speech.
			-I first spoke of Forcas's love for the city and it's people, saying how much it would
			 have meant to have this crowd here, and exhorting them to drag to the funeral any who
			 aren't already.
			-I then spoke of how Forcas died. How, while serving the people of this city, while
			 kneeling in _prayer_ on Sasserine's streets, he was cut down by a monstrous beast
			 dwelling among them. "Will you let this stand?" I asked.
			-At this point, a member of the council started trying to stop me, calling for the
			 guards to get me out of there, and saying it was time for his speech.
				-Isaias intervened, though, standing between us and talking to him, buying me time.
			-While that was going on, I stared at something in my hands for a moment, eventually
			 lifting it to show the crowd the bloody rag Forcas had been wearing when he was cut
			 down.
				-"This rag is what Forcas wore when the beast slew him! How," I shouted, throwing
				 the bloody rag into the crown, "Are you going to answer the spilled blood of a
				 saint?!?"
				-The crowd drew back as it fell, then rushed forward, staring reverently at it on
				 the ground.
				-Nkondi eventually collected it, affixing it to a pole as a makeshift standard.
			-I then began rallying them against The Shapers and The Morticians' Guild, speaking of
			 "the vile, twisted beasts, this Shaper gang, living among you" and "the foul corruption
			 of their corpse-stealing allies in The Morticians' Guild". As more and more improvised
			 clubs and torches began to appear, I told them, "We need to drive out this corruption,
			 with Forcas's holy, cleansing light!"
	-We then set the cart bearing Forcas's body alight ("They won't get _this_ body!") and,
	 with it in tow and Nkondi holding our bloody standard aloft, we lead the crowd towards
	 the nearest Morticians' guildhouse.
		-The door was elaborately locked, but that's no barrier to a mob. "Find a ram!" I called out.
		-Nkondi guided a group to a nearby statue that was toppled to serve the purpose.
		-As the were bringing it up, though, the zombie dragon returned, alighting on the roof of
		 The Morticians' Guild and roaring, scattering much of the crowd.
		-The beast wasted no time spraying my fellows with it's freezing breath, but I was
		 fortunately quicker, and already hiding behind a statue after taking a running pot shot at
		 it with my wand.
		-I continued sniping the beast while my comrades engaged in melee.
		-It knocked Isaias to the ground where he lay unmoving, but a blow from Jade felled the
		 creature.
	-While Jade saw to Isaias's wounds, getting him back on his feet, I ran off in search of the
	 scattered crowd.
		-"The dragon is gone!" I told them. "Can there be any doubt now that it was The Morticians
		 who attacked Forcas's wake?!? The very same beast guards their guildhouse! Show them
		 Forcas's light! Bring those torches!"
	-By the time I returned with a mob at my back, Isaias was back up, blade in hand, and the door to
	 the guildhouse was open. Jade was talking with someone in the darkness within.
	-She turned and began to say something to the rest of the party, but I was busy shouting
	 incitements at the mob.
	-The crowd was soon surging forward, setting the outside of the building alight as they threw
	 rocks and jars of lamp oil through the building's windows.
	-The guildhouse was soon a towering inferno, and the mob was looking for more targets.
	-Nkondi raised the matter of the catacombs, the ones we'd been investigating when Forcas died,
	 and we led the mob, bearing the statue-ram, to that door.
		-The door was fortified with spells, and the ram did no real damage to it, but we still had
		 the Knock scroll we'd purchased for just this.
		-I encouraged the crowd to step back and called Jade forward. "How are you with scrolls? I
		 can't read this shit but can probably make this work. Seems more like your kind of thing,
		 though."
		-She was confident of her skills, took the scroll, and soon had the door open.
		-We and the mob then streamed inside, with me shouting, "Come! Bring the light of Forcas to
		 these tunnels, and drive these necromancers from their holes!"
		-We found ourselves in a series of catacombs, as expected, with many of the tombs apparently
		 having been ransacked.
		-Surging forward with the crowd, we were met in an interior chamber by a booming voice, an
		 ogre shouting, "Come at me!"
		-Rather than oblige him, I stared him down, _really_ hard, manifesting Mind Thrust, and he
		 reeled, clutching his head. I immediately ducked behind some handy cover, hiding in the
		 shadows there.
		-Isaias rushed forward to engage the ogre, as some robed figures rushed up to it's aid, from
		 behind the creature, casting spells upon it.
		-Jade joined in the attack as well, with her bow, while Nkondi cast spells.
		-I leaned out of my cover, taking careful aim with my bow, and shot one of the robed
		 necromancers _right in her fucking face_.
		-Unfortunately the ogre evened the score by smashing Isaias into the ground with it's club,
		 leaving him an unmoving tangle of broken limbs.
		-Compounding matters, one of the necromancers began chanting and waving, and I soon felt a
		 great weariness coming over me. I powered through it by force of (psionically enhanced)
		 will, but Jade fell to the ground beside me, snoring.
		-The mob, at Nkondi's urging, began to pelt the ogre with improvised incendiaries. Soon, it
		 and it's immediate surroundings were aflame, and the flames rapidly spreading to the
		 surrounding dry debris.
		-The ogre ran, screaming, deeper into the catacombs, and the necromancers followed him in a
		 somewhat more organized retreat.
		-"Nkondi!" I shouted, "Check on Isaias!" Meanwhile, I shook Jade awake.
		-Nkondi looked grim, and began to mutter, saying, "Well, at least they won't have this
		 body. . ."
		-He began to pour lamp oil over Isaias, but I shouted at him, saying, "Stop! Just drag him
		 out of here! There may be something we can still do. . . or something to remember him by."
		-He indeed began to drag, and I soon joined him in a macabre race, dragging the necromancer
		 I downed out of the tunnels too (for clues and profit both!).
		-Once outside the smoke-spewing door of the catacombs, we checked on Isaias, and found he
		 was indeed beyond help.
		-So, we rifled through pockets.
			-The necromancer had unsurprising equipment, the most interesting of which were some
			 scrolls, and also 75 gold. The gold was actually the strangest thing, as the coins were
			 all stamped with the emblem of The Morticians' Guild. . .
			-Digging through Isaias's gear, The Orb of the Brotherhood fell out of a pocket on his
			 backpack, along with a strange iron fork that looks like it would fit in one of
			 the orb's slots.
				-The fork was new to us, and I asked Jade if she knew what it was for.
				-She said she thought it might be a key to one of The Brotherhood's planes, which
				 quickly had me backing away, but she boldly slotted it into the orb.
				-Handling it a moment more, she said she thought that had unlocked some divine
				 power for use by the bearer, but I told her, "You're welcome to keep it, so long
				 as you keep it the hell away from me. . ."
			-Isais also strangely had two holy symbols, both of which I recognized. One was the
			 symbol of the god he professed to follow, Shawn of the Brotherhood, but the other bore
			 the symbol of Enilias, another, sneakier member of The Brotherhood.

7/27/22: A man, a warforged, and a dragonborn walk into a bar. . .
	-That night, the city burned.
		-The guards mostly kept matters under control, and the fires gradually began to gutter out.
		-The rioting too slowly calmed, the obvious targets already having been burned and looted. 
		-I eventually got separated from the others, strolling through the streets with a bottle in
		 one hand and an unsheathed rapier in the other.
		-As I walked through Sasserine's streets, I came upon a(nother) shouting crowd.
		-I elbowed my way to the front of the scrum, I saw a group of city guards, beating a well-
		 rusted warforged with cudgels as he struggled on the ground.
			-Arguing with the guards was a humanoid with golden scales, and the features of a lizard.
			-"What offense did this man commit?" he was asking the guards.
			 "Yeah! What'd he dooo?" I shouted over from the crowd, slurring slightly.
			-"He's not a man," the guard responded to the lizard, practically spitting.
			 "Neither am I. . ." the draconic figure said threateningly.
			 "Well, I suppose that's so. . . But this thing protected a bunch of anarchists. . ."
			 "I think he's had enough," the scaled humanoid said, practically growling now.
			-The guards were starting to look nervous, and the one speaking to the reptilian figure
			 turned to his compatriots and shouted, "OK! Pack it in! We're leaving."
			-They left behind the warforged, battered despite heavy armor that was nearly as worn as
			 it's wearer.
			-Curious, I approached the scaled figure and asked him, "Are you related to the party
			 lizard?"
			-He chuckled and said, "I've heard stories, but alas no."
			-After my interruption, he continued to fiddle with his belt, and then reaching out at
			 the warforged, a flash of light suggested it bore some magic property, and, indeed, the
			 warforged was soon clambering back up onto his feet, some what less worse for the wear.
			-"You must be friends," it said, "To have healed me. I am E3-SOMETHING, but my friends
			 call me 'Rusty'."
				-"I'm Fred!" I said. "Fred the Red!"
				-"What was this all about?" the warforged's draconic savior asked.
				 "They were teenagers. The guards would have harmed them. Better me."
				-The warforged looked around itself and then said, "We should seek shelter."
				 "I think there's a bar a block over there?" I responded. "If not, the one after!"
		-As we made our way that direction, the lizard spoke up, introducing himself as "Sarge".
			-"Military?" the warforged asked.
			 "Yeah," Sarge replied, and they fell to reminiscing.
			 ". . . the battalion was all wiped out," Sarge finished.
			 "Between jobs now, huh?" I asked him. "There are a lot of party lizard jobs in this
			  city."
			 "I have. . . a more specialized set of skills," was his reply.
			 "I haven't had a decent job since the war. . ." Rusty mumbled, diconsolately, and
			 recounted the loss of _his_ entire battalion.
			-Looking at back at me, Sarge then said, "I saw your speech."
		     "Yeah, lost a friend too. . ." I said. "He's a hero now! Gotta do what you can to
			  remember your friends. . ."
		-When we got to the bar, we found the word "closed" hastily painted across it's door.
			-None the less, I pulled out a gold piece and began to clink it against the door, slowly
			 and rythmically.
			-Eventually, a voice called out from inside, shouting, "Go away! We're closed!"
			 "We just want a drink!" I replied. "Open up! Things are calming down and people are
			  going to have a thirst!"
			 "How do I know you're not ruffians?" the voice inside responded.
			 "Would ruffians pay the cover?" I shouted, sliding three gold beneath the bar's door.
			-Soon, I could hear someone tugging at the bar behind the door, and it was opened.
			-"Sorry," the apparent proprietor said. "We had some trouble in here earlier and, well,
			 with the state of the city tonight, we figured we'd better lock up for the evening.
			 "Oh, it's no problem!" I replied. "And just perfect for me! I was looking for a quiet
			  conversation with my new friends anyways!"
			-He ushered us quickly inside, barring the door behind us, and I then handed him several
			 more gold for a round for all of us.
				-Sarge ordered some kind of devil gin the barkeep talked up.
				-I, meanwhile, asked for a cup of red wine. Turning to my new friends, and gesturing
				 at my red doublet, I said, "It doesn't show if I get it on the attire!"
					-Blatently ignoring the various reddish stains that already dotted it after this
					 evening. . .
				-"Do you have any grease?" Rusty asked the barkeep, avoiding any awkward silence
				 there.
				 "Good for the joints, eh? It's the hells getting old!" I commented.
				 "After the first millennia, things get rough. . ."
			 -Once served, Sarge raised his glass in toast, saying, "Thanks, Fred!"
			  "To new friends and old, silver and gold," I toasted.
			  "And rusted," Rusty flatly responded.
			 -"What brings you to the city?" Sarge asked me, as we drank.
			  "I'm seeking news of the world, and trade opportunities. A patron wants to know. What
			   about you? What brings you to Sasserine?" I deflected.
			  "I'm looking for work. My battalion, we flew aboard airships, but I'd now take
			   whatever work presents itself for a warrior."
			  "Airships, huh?" I asked, perking back up. "That's music to my ears! I myself fly on,
			   lets say, a _very_ light frigate!"
			  "Ah," Sarge responded. "I would very much like to return to the air. It speaks to the
			   souls of the dragonborn, this connection to our forebearers."
			  "Few warforged served aboard airships," Rusty broke in. "Too heavy, to have a whole
			   unit of us. Plus, they worried we might share. . . a certain solidarity, with the
			   bound air elementals that power them."
			 -Rusty then broke into an extended anecdote about the depressing history of his kind.
			  ". . . that sleep then lasted centuries. It was not our will, but part of a treaty,
			   and it brought peace."
			 -"Just once," he continued, "I would like to fight for a cause I believe in. And I
			   would like to fly in your ship."
			  "Well. . . welcome aboard, I guess! Stick close to me big targ. . . guy, and we'll go
			   far!"
			 -Rusty then made a suggestion, saying "I am in poor shape for a fight right now, but
			  I do have a stash of healing potions and other equipment not far from here, if you
			  wish to accompany me and retrieve it."
			  "Might want to wait until the sun comes up," I protested. "Things are calming down,
			   but they'll be a lot calmer once it's brighter."
			 -It was still the early hours of the morning, so we settled in at the bar, having
			  another couple rounds and some food.
				-"I do not require rest," Rusty volunteered. "I can stand guard, though, if you wish
				  to."
				-Letting out a yawn, I said, "Yeah, I could use some shut-eye. . . maybe nap in this
				 booth for a bit. . ."
				-Rusty got up, marched stiff-backed to the door, back to the table, and then
				 repeated that, at least through when I nodded off.
		-When next I opened my eyes, it was to Nkondi walking into the bar.
			-"Hey! Nkondi!" I cried out. "How's it going! Have a drink! I still have half a wine
			  here somewhere. . ."
			-He sat with us, and drew forth his own bottle of rum from his pack.
			-We did a round of introductions, and Nkondi asked after the sorry state of Rusty.
			-"He needs repairs," I responded. "But he said he had a stash of stuff for it nearby."
			-"Speaking of which," I continued, "How's the city, Nkondi?"
			-He claimed there was still a fair amount of chaos, roving mobs and looters.
			-"Ah, OK! We were thinking we'd relax here for a bit, while things calm down, and then,
			  pick up Rusty's shit."
			-The barkeeper pestered Nkondi a bit, but Nkondi threw some coins to him.
			-Nkondi then began talking to something that was not there, and he and Rusty got into a
			 conversation about spirits, leading eventually to Sarge chiming in as Rusty began to
			 reminisce about ancient history. Rusty apparently wants to find the ghost of a dead
			 friend, but I soon lost interest in the whole thing, paying more attention to swirling
			 my wine.
		-We eventually bedded back down, and awoke with the sky light, the streets coming back to
		 normal life, though there were still more guards than usual walking the streets, and often
		 jeers or stones thrown their way, from the populace.
			-Nkondi did a lot of staring at the construct, while I announced, "I'm going to go find
			 the barkeep, and see if he can scare us up some breakfast."
			-Soon, we were eating, and discussing going to find Rusty's stash as our next order of
			 business.
	-Walking out onto the street, the city was indeed tense.
		-As we walked, we saw some of the guards pasting up posters. Approaching one such, we found
		 it showed a terrible likeness of _me_, along with the words, "Wanted for disturbing the
		 peace. Reward is 100 gold."
		-Well, this city is burned. Where to next, I guess?
		-Rounding a corner, we saw a wizard watched over by a couple of guards, magically creating
		 a larger image of some (mostly) bullshit stuff I _supposedly_ did at the funeral.
		-Nkondi wasted no time in hurling the coffee in his hand at the wizard, scoring a hit and
		 provoking some sputtering rage.
		-The guards began to cast their eyes about for who threw it, and Nkondi (probably unwisely)
		 began shouting, saying, "They're despoiling the memory of our heros, with their lies!"
		-"Yeah, listen to him!" I joined in. "These guys are shit!"
		-Soon, the nearby citizens were shouting and throwing refuse at the guards.
		-Nkondi then (actually wisely) turned and ran. I was quick in following him and, after a
		 glance between them, Sarge and Rusty were following too.
		-Rounding a corner, we paused to gather our breath (those of us that needed it), and to
		 disguise ourselves, Nkondi with a spell and I by turning my coat inside out and mussing my
		 hair.
	-Rusty then led us to where his stash was, in a sewer.
		-On the way there, he warned us of some "guardian", that would need a password.
		-"Sure, sure, Rustbucket," I said. "You've got that right?"
		-He just turned and walked on.
		-Arriving at the mouth of a sewer, where it emptied into the ocean, Rusty stopped us short,
		 and, from the pool beneath it, rose a hulking, headless figure, it's face emerging straight
		 from it's shoulders.
		-The creature blocked our way, standing there blankly, while Rusty almost stammered, ". . . 
		 I knew this. . . what was the word. . . let me search my memory banks. Does anyone know
		 the tongues of the elementals?"
		-I volunteered some smattering of Auran, to no real avail, while Nkondi chatted with things
		 I could not see, eventually muttering, "Understanding?"
			-I voiced the word in Auran, apparently sparking some recollection in Rusty, who uttered
			 something in one of the other elemental tongues, prompting the creature to sink back
			 into his pool.
		-Rusty walked towards the opening, and I steeled myself to follow, but Sarge protested,
		 saying, "I'm not going in there. I don't do water. I'll guard the entrance."
		-"Very well," Rusty replied, wading into the sewage.
		-Fortunately it was not too far inside that Rusty led us, retrieving from an alcove his
		 "repair kit" and pouring some apparently magical oils over himself.
		-We emerged, stinking, to some scornful looks from Sarge.
			-Well, we'll see how good he smells without any baths, if he's really so afraid of water.
	-"So," Sarge said, turning to me, "You said you had a way out of the city?"
		-"Yep!" I replied. "We'll have to make our way to docks. I've got some friends that'll be
		  pretty sore if I leave them behind, though."
		 "Where are these friends?" Rusty asked.
		 "One's off with her family. Not sure what happened to Jade. Lost track of her last night."
		-"Well," I continued, "They know where the ship is. Maybe they'll meet us there!"
	-On the way to the docks, we also stopped by a likely seeming shop, looking to unload last
	 night's loot.
		-Dedicated weapon shops had been closed by order of The Dawn Council, but we found a
		 somewhat disreputable pawn shop run by a self-described "personal defense enthusiast".
		-We sold our loot, and I got myself some silver arrows.
	-We then took our leave and walked on towards the docks.
		-Ascending to the skydocks, we were stopped at the top of the stair by a group of guards.
		-They asked us if we'd seen me, pointing at one of the wanted posters one held.
		-I assured them we'd never associate with such rabble, but Sarge had to open his big lizard
		 mouth too, and they suspected he was full of shit.
		-Sarge began to threaten them and, half in support of theat and half to defuse things, I
 		 broke in, saying, "Do you know who he _is_? He's the party lizard! A genuine celebrity!"
		 "Huh! I've heard tales of him," one of the guards responded. "They said he could drink a
		  whole cask."
		 "Two," Sarge growled in response.
		 "Well, the party lizard knew Fredrick! We better take this lot in for questioning!"
			-Shit.
		-"Look, you don't want to do that!" I began. "You'd be messing with a _celebrity_. It'll be
		  a whole thing!"
		 "Tell us where he is, then, and maybe we can be done with this."
		 "OK, look, we were supposed to be here for the party lizard's big return. We were going
		  to see Fredrick at the bar where it all started," I said. "You know the. . ."
		 "Lusty Leopard?" one of the guards volunteered.
		 "Yeah, the Lusty Leper! Though why anyone would want to drink in a place like that. . ."
		 "No, _Leopard_," the guard clarified. "The owner couldn't spell, and the 'D' fell off. . ."
		 "Ugh! His 'D' fell off?!?" I went on.
		 At that point the apparent leader of the group broke in, shouting, "Forget it! If Fredrick
		 is supposed to be there, then we'll take you over there and you can point him out."
		 "Uh. . . sure," I shrugged.
	-Somewhere in that exchange, Nkondi apparently slipped off, the spell camouflaging him still
	 being in effect, so the guards led the three of us they'd seen back down to the streets of the
	 city.
		-This could have gone better. . .
		-They led us to the bar, and questioned the patrons, who all said they'd not seen the person
		 on the poster, with thankfully none of them pointing at the man standing with the guards. . .
		-"Well, where is he?" one of the guards asked us.
		 "Beats me! He was supposed to meet us here. Though the event wasn't supposed to start until
		  nine. . ."
		 "We can't wait here for hours!"
		 "Aw, come on!" I wheedled, "Lets get some food and see if they turn up! This place is great!"
		 "Well, it is almost lunch time. . ."
		 "Great! Barkeep! Get us each the lunch special, and a round of those strong ales!"
		-We sat down to some food, but the guards were distressingly resistant to my efforts to get
		 them to really drinking.
		-As they finished off their food, the ales mostly untouched in front of them, one of them
		 began to stand, saying, "Well, we've waited long enough. Lets take you over to the station."
		-Sarge then lept to his feet, his chair clattering to the floor behind him, snarling and
		 flexing his claws. The fight was on.
		-We made short work of the guards, especially after Sarge set several of them on fire.
		-Turning to the terrified crowd as I darted towards the door, I shouted, "Our work here is
		 done! Stick around a bit, and the next round's on me!"
		-I tossed a fist full of gold towards the bar and turned to my companions, saying, "Lets get
		 the fuck out of here guys."
	-As we left the bar, we ran into a young boy, who had a message for us from Nkondi. It said,
	 "Guards on ship, look at local billboards. we should leave for a while. meet at the home of the
	  original Reverie Reptile tomorrow morning."
		-Well, that plan's shot.
		-"Want me to take a message back?" the kid asked. "It'll only cost you, uh, a gold?"
		 "How about this, kid?" I said. "If you know how to find the one who sent this, take _us_
		  there and you'll get your gold."
		 "Really?!? Alright! This way!"
		-The boy led us back toward the docks, pointing out Nkondi lurking in the shadow of a closed
		 market stall just outside them.
	-Reunited with Nkondi, we resolved to find the others, and to get the hells out of this city.
		-We were unsure where to find Jade but, in the course of describing her and her interests,
		 Sarge volunteered that he knew of a well regarded magical foundry in the city that rented
		 workspace.
			-Following him there, and inside, I indeed spotted Jade bent over a workbench in the
			 back of the large, open building.
			-I approached and greeted her, and she was full of recriminations about how out of hand
			 things had gotten last night.
			-I agreed that things were a mess, and suggested it was time to get the hells out of the
			 city, before any of the consequnces for that all fell on _our_ heads.
			-Before we left, I also helped her disguise herself, warning her that the guards seemed
			 unpleasantly interested in speaking with us, eliciting a sigh in response.
		-Jade, a local, knew where to find the estate of House Dracus, so she led the way from there.
			-Suspecting these high-brow folks might not take kindly to strangers on the doorstep, I
			 concocted a ruse with my medal from The Dawn Council.
			-Knocking on the door, I told the rather rude servant that answered that, "Lady Maya
			 left this medal behind where she dined two nights ago. The proprietor asked me to
			 deliver it to her. Let her know I'm waiting out here, if she feels compelled to offer
			 a reward. . ."
			-The butler continued to be a general ass about the whole affair, and there were a few
			 holes in the plan, I having forgotten Maya hadn't joined us until _after_ we earned
			 that, and he apparently being well aware of both what it was and that Maya had not
			 received one.
			-Nonetheless, after impressing on him that it's _clearly_ valuable, and something she'd
			 not want to lose if she _did_ leave it there, the prick eventually took it to her, and
			 she emerged from the estate a short while later."
			-I explained our trouble, and our planned departure from the city aboard the airship.
			-She seemed tempted to go with us, but also reluctant to abandon her family in an
			 apparent hour of need.
				-They'd been tasked with tracking down an influx of counterfeit currency, and Maya
				 felt she was unable to leave them until the matter was resolved.
				-Instead, she gave me a coin bearing the emblem of her house, saying that she would
				 be able to Teleport to it once she was free.
				 "Well, if you've got the cash for something like that, that works!" I said. "See
				  you in a bit!"
				-Turning to the rest of the group, I said, "Sounds like it's time to get the back to
				 the ship and to get the fuck out of here. Back to the docks!"


8/10/22:
	-We decided to do some asking around, near the docks, to get some idea of what we're getting into.
		-In a dockside bar, I met a grizzled dwarf, who complained that, "Since the old dockmaster
		 died, the place has been a mess!"
		 "What a shame!" I replied. "What if the city were attacked? Have the defenses been
		  neglected? Does the city maintain no ships?"
		 "Maybe some ships," he said, "Though you'd think they would have used them last night during
		  the riots. They must have _some_ defenses. . ."
		-Taking our leave of the dwarf, we grabbed a table, and spent some time disguising ourselves.
		-Our disguises in place, we stepped outside the bar, only to see Maya walking around the
		 street outside, observing the docks herself.
		-I got her attention, and let her know it was me beneath the disguise (a thing she _claimed_
		 she already knew. . .).
		-We returned to the bar, to catch up with her.
			-It seemed she was now amenable to leaving, and that her pursuit of the counterfeiters
			 was now going to lead her to a dwarven city, one she'd very much like to visit with us.
		-So, we discussed the plan. Figuring we'd try talking first, we came up with a ruse to claim
		 Maya's family had just purchased the impounded ship.
		-Nkondi was interested in "conferring with the ancestors", and changing his spells, so we
		 decided to rent some rooms and attempt this tomorrow.
			-I spent some of the intervening time spreading rumors of the ship purchase, hanging
			 around bars near the docks, talking about the "sale", and my new life as an airman.
			-We even encountered some off duty guards at one, and made sure they overheard my
			 discussion with Maya about the ship's sale.
			-Eventually, I joined Nkondi at a graveyard, where he was performing his ritual, before
			 we turned in.
				-It was quite the show! If Edric's church involved this much rum, drums, and
				 shouting, I might have been more religious.
				-Apparently _his_ gods (or ancestors or whatever) demand booze. In particular, he
				 asked me what I knew about old booze, saying he might appease his patron with such.
					-Talking about it, elves came up, and he mentioned a "Castle Arakhain", on the
					 mainland, that might have ancient vintages. Sounds like a good stop to me!
			-Finally, we found an inn, and got some rest.
	-The next morning, we got our disguises together, and headed over to the airship docks.
		-We did have to talk our way onto the docks themselves, due to a heavy guard presence, but
		 they bought our story about Maya buying a ship.
		-"Well, Lady Dracus, shall we make our inspection?" I asked and, at her nod, we began
		 walking towards the ship.
		-The guards aboard ship bought the story about the sale, and we even convinced them that the
		 lady would be taking it for a quick cruise, though they insisted on staying aboard.
		-Taking the ship out over the sea, we consulted with one another, and decided to take the
		 ship down low and toss the guards into the sea, with a crate to serve as a float.
			-Eh, whatever soothes the others' consciences. I just want my ship back.
		-While I was busy with the ships wheel, Nkondi summoned a pair of vultures below deck, used
		 them to distract the guards, and took Maya "hostage".
		-Threatening her, he demanded the guards drop their weapons, and, when they complied, Rusty
		 tied them up.
		-He then turned Maya over to Jade, who led her below deck.
		-Nkondi then began to escalate things, muttering prayers to is ancestors over one of the
		 bound guards and drawing a knife.
		-His intentions rather clear, a panicked guard slipped his (apparently shoddily tied)
		 bonds and made a break for it.
		-While Nkondi was busy with that, Sarge made a "join or die" speech, attempting to press-
		 gang the others.
		-The guards were looking fearful after that, but not professing their loyalty or anything
		 like that.
		-Nkondi ignored the fleeing guard, stabbing one of those still bound in his throat, while
		 his summoned birds savaged two more of them.
		-Soon, it devolved into combat, an admittedly one-sided one, due to the guards having
		 dropped their weapons already.
		-By the time Jade and Maya came back up on deck to investigate the noise, Nkondi had
		 already cut the hearts out of several of the dead guards, and the bodies had all been
		 thrown overboard from the bloodstained deck.
	-With some free time now, we consulted a map of the region in (my) cabin: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1007116989568925766
		-Sharaar Kol, the dwarven city Maya wished to visit, was not far, near the shore of Manta
		 Bay, where Sasserine, an island city, is located.
		-We set a course for the dwarven city.


TODO:
	-Express some remorse over the dead guards.
		-"Some of them might have been willing to join up!"
		-But, you were distracted by how good it felt to be at the wheel of your ship again!
			-Real freedom at last!
			-Sasserine was getting a bit stifling. You know, being recognized and all.


8/24/22:
	-Inspecting the ship, it looks like they even topped up our air elementals!
	-After 2 days in the air, we sighted misty mountains ahead, the Greywall range, and soon spotted
	 the city's air docks.
		-Flanked by two enormous statues, they were carved into the side of a mountain.
		-There was very little traffic, but we directed to an empty berth by a sunrod-waving dwarf.
	-We were met by a dwarf, apparently an employee of the docks.
		-By the time I'd finished tying the ship up at the berth and ran over, he'd already launched
		 into the usual questions about cargo declarations and such with the others.
		-I did some minor schmoozing, but he seemed stubbornly resistant to flattery.
		-He did inform us that, "The upper city is for traders. Outsiders like you. Lower city is
		 for dwarves."
		 "Perfect! Point the way!" I replied.
		 "It's down the spiral stair, there. About 30 minutes down."
		-At the thought of that many stairs, I turned to Rusty, saying, ". . . Rusty, have you ever
		 heard of a 'piggy-back ride'?"
		 "No?"
		 "Perfect! We're going to practice a new technique! Here, let me clamber up onto your
		  back. . . Huh, look! No hands! . . .I bet I can even use a bow from up here!"
	-As we walked down, it was indeed an interminable trip down. Soon, everyone, save Rusty and
	 myself, was breathing hard.
		-While we walked, Maya talked, telling us more about the matter of forged signet rings her
		 family had tasked her with investigating.
			-She showed an example, demonstrating how, by some complex mechanism or magic, it could
			 change from a generic looking symbol to another, matching one of the Sasserine sigils
			 I remember from a banner when we were declared heroes of Sasserine.
			-In return for our help with this matter, she said her family could help smooth things
			 over for us in Sasserine.
			-"That'd be nice," I said, "But we also need to bring in some coin to keep the ship
			  flying."
			 "Well, we'll have to keep an eye out for opportunities to trade along they way, then,"
			 she replied.
	-Finally reaching the bottom of the stair, we gazed upon a bustling village within a cavern,
	 centered around a statue of a dwarf. Small buildings filled the floor of the cavern, with
	 crystals growing among them.
	-As we stood about for a bit, I suggested we next find some lodgings, a base of operations,
	 and perhaps some of the famed dwarven ale. We decided to ask around, for recommendations.
		-Greeting a dwarf standing idle out in fron of a shop, he suggested "The Crystallized
		 Pig", a bar and inn.
		-He also spoke of an "Old Foam Beard", whose capacity for drink was legendary.
			-I've got to meet this guy. He sounds like a blast.
		-In the course of this, Maya referred to me twice as "our captain". A good start on my
		 future, that.
	-Following the directions given, we entered The Crystallized Pig, and Maya immediately began
	 conversing with the innkeep in Dwarvish.
		-They seemed to get along splendidly, and Maya had soon arranged (and paid for) rooms for
		 all of us, for four days, and a round of a strong ale that turned out to be _fantastic_.
		-Drinks in front of us, we then discussed our next move.
		-Maya intended to visit local craftsmen, and figure out who would be capable of such work.
		-I agreed that sounded promising, but also said that we had a craftswoman right here,
		 suggesting that Jade take a look.
		-Obliging, Jade examined the ring, mentioning that it used an odd flux, something we could
		 potentially use to identify other works by the same group.
	-While this went on, May also apparently did some eavesdropping. Leaning in, she gestured to a
	 nearby table, where three dwarves sat, and said that they'd apprently lost a friend.
		-Two of the dwarves looked like warriors, while the third was garbed as a cleric.
		-"Perhaps, she said, "If we help them, they can help us access the lower city? Assisting in
		  our investigation?"
		-Agreeing it sounded promising, I volunteered to take point.
		-I walked up to the bar and asked the innkeep for another four of the "Wicked Trident" that
		 we'd been drinking, taking them over to the dwarves' table.
		-"Hi! My friend over there," I said, gesturing to Maya, "She speaks the language, and heard
		  you lost a friend. Death is hard. . . gone forever. . . Here, I wanted to offer my
		  condolences, and a round of the reserve."
		 "Aye? You have our thanks, though maybe he's not lost forever. . ." one of them responded.
		 "Ah, not the permanent parting, then? Good!"
		 "Eh, perhaps that would have been easier. . ." he replied.
		 "How so? Most anything is better than death. . ."
		 "He went insane. . . We were down in the mines, exploring a collapsed section of cave.
		  Only he was nimble enough to squeeze through. When he came back, though, he was insisted
		  we return to the city, and began behaving strangely. . . We had to cut ties with him, and
		  he's now in prison. . ." he said, trailing off. Taking another drink, he perked up a bit,
		  saying, "Hey, this is good stuff!"
		 "Perhaps we can help! There are various magics that can affect the mind. Perhaps he's
		  been enscrolled," I said. "Several among us are well versed in such things, we could
		  examine him. Does the prison accept vistors?"
		 "I'm not sure. No one has ever asked. It wouldn't do for a dwarf to be seen associating
		  with a lawbreaker."
		 "Well," I replied, "We could try it. I don't get the impression that the opinion most
		  here have of outsiders could get much lower. . ."
		 "Who is your friend?" Maya broke in and asked.
		 "Codwell. We called him, Cod, or 'Half-Beard'. Shamefully, he was born with a beard
		  covering only half of his face. A great shame. . . but he worked hard, and earned his
		  keep."
		 "We'll see what we can do," Maya replied, "It would help, though, if we could see the
		  cave where his incident occurred."
		-They then began discussing directions to a cave with an opening to the surface, some miles
		 from the city, overland.
		-Maya and the dwarves continued to socialize while I savored my remaining ale, until their
		 conversation took a disturbing turn, and caught my attention again.
			-They were discussing the history of the city, and it's founder, Sharaar Kol, for whom
			 the city was named. "He dug the city's first mine," the dwarf was saying, "And found a
			 purple crystal the size of his beard. It entranced a _god_. . ."
			 "What god?" Maya asked.
			 "The great creator god," the dwarf replied. "Have you heard of Edric? He saw great
			  psionic power in the crystal, and made a deal for it, offering the city his
			  protection."
			-I began to look distinctly uncomfortable, and the crystals growing around the city
			 took on a quite sinister aspect for me. . .
	-Though I'd quite lost my appetite, the others insisted on finishing their lunches, but we soon
	 headed to the prison.
		-Walking inside, we could indeed see a dwarf with half a beard in one of the cells.
		-We were stopped by another, a guard, who asked our business.
		-"We wanted to speak to one of the prisoners," I said, "He might know about a dangerous
		  hazard nearby."
		-He shrugged and asked, "Which one?"
		 "The one with half a beard," I said.
		-He led us over to the dwarf's cell.
		-Looking at the dwarf, I could tell he was clearly enscrolled, and Nkondi agreed. Cod calmly
		 spoke nonsense, babbling about river monsters, but his eyes looked at us, pleadlingly, with
		 seemingly no connection to his speech.
	-Well, we began debating options for breaking the unknown enchantment.
		-Though Jade looked thoughtful, rummaging through her pack and looking through books she
		 drew forth from it, none of us came up with an option we could personally manage.
		-So, we headed back to bar, hoping Cod's priestly friend could dispell the magic affecting
		 him, or at least know someone who could manage it.
		-That, though, turned into an acrimonious religious discussion.
			-The cleric seemed none too fond of his roguish friend Cod.
			-Meanwhile, Nkondi was doing his very best to antagonize the cleric, questioning both
			 his motives and his faith, and insulting his god.
		-Before that got too far out of hand, though, Jade looked up from one of her books and
		 interrupted, shouting, "Oh! I've got it! I can fix him!"
	-Taking our leave of Cod's friends, we went back to the prison to see him again.
		-"We came back to knock some sense into one of your prisoners," I told the guard.
		-Jade clarified that she had a method that would dispell the magic affecting Cod.
		-Taking a glove, she smeared it with magical reagents and muttered incantations over it.
		-Then, drawing close to the bars and calling Cod over to her, she slapped him across the face
		 with it.
		-Casting his eyes about at his surroundings, and then back to us, Cod asked, "What in the
		 hells happened?"
		 "You've been talking crazy," Jade said, "And got locked in prison because of it."
		 ". . . huh?"
		 "You were enscrolled, my good dwarf!" I told him. "Something in that cave you squeezed into
		  seems to have done it. What did you find in there?"
		 "There was a. . . river of. . . arcane energy. In it, there was a. . . it looked like a
		  ham. . . some hunk of meat."
		-Glancing at my fellows, I asked, ". . . Are you sure your glove worked, Jade?"
		-That elicited awkward laughs from all of us, save Nkondi. "I've heard of a necromantic
		 ritual," he said, "Preserving brains in jars. A river of magic could preserve and sustain
		 something similarly. . ."
		-Nkondi was suddenly very eager to visit this cave, and Sarge was curious too.
		-"Visiting the local tourist attractions is all well and good, guys, but we did also solve,
		  well, most of Cod's problems," I said. "Guard! He's in much better shape now. Are you able
		  to let him out?"
		 "He hasn't served out his sentence yet," the guard replied.
		 "What was he sentenced to?" I asked, as Nkondi spoke over me, asking, "What was he sentenced
		  _for_?"
		 "A year," the guard replied, "For disturbing the peace."
		-Nkondi then worked himself up into a good rant, saying the man had received a. . . _vision_
		 of great danger, and asking how they could imprison this _prophet_. "You would imprison
		 Moradin himself!" he finished.
		-Somewhat to my surprise, the guard seemed a bit shaken. Perhaps he's a bit more religious
		 than I, for he turned to the prisoner and asked him a series of questions in dwarvish.
		-Apparently satisfied with the answers, the guard agreed to let him go, after making him
		 swear some kind of oath (again in dwarvish). He did turn to us first, though, and asked,
		 "Can you give him an extra slap to be sure?"
		 "Doesn't hurt to be sure!" I enthusiastically replied, "Well, doesn't hurt _us_. . ."
	-Once Cod was free of his cell, I asked him if he was ready to return to his friends.
		-He actually seemed a bit reluctant, particularly to face the judgy cleric, but he
		 eventually agreed to walk back with us to the inn.
		-On the way, I pressed him for more details of what he saw.
		-Beyond the river meat, he described ornate pillars in the cave, and. . . beasts, that
		 seemed to be under the meat's control.
		-"What do you think it wanted, with sending me back to the city?" he also speculated.
		 "Ha!" I laughed. "Probably to lure more victims back to it. . ."
		 "You might not be wrong," he said.
		 "Probably not! It's working, after all," I replied, looking around at my companions.
	-Walking back into the tavern with him, the cleric looked a bit ashamed at the sight of his
	 erstwhile companion, while Cod immediately set into berating him.
		-"You were going to _leave_ me there. A year!"
		-Nkondi happily egged him on to, and joined in berating the cleric, saying, "I don't know
		 whether Moradin was too useless or you to cowardly to help. . ."
		-Much shouting amongst the dwarves ensued, with Nkondi trying to start a fight while Maya
		 tried to calm them down, and me leaning up against the bar, new drink in hand, watching
		 the show.
		-Maya got the better of that, and soon the two dwarves were hugging, to my slight
		 disappointment.
		-Nkondi even procured some kind of shot from the bartender, and approached the cleric with
		 it, apparently as some kind of peace offering.
			-The cleric sniffed it, then poured half of it into an empty glass and shoving it toward
			 Nkondi.
			-They each downed their respective portions. The cleric then immediately vomited
			 violently onto the table between them, followed by Nkondi doing the same seconds later.
			-The bartender began yelling at them to get the hells out. Nkondi slipped him a gold
			 coin and adjourned to his room, while the cleric walked out the door, shaking his head.
		-The rest of the evening proceeded apace, with Jade also drinking heavily (I'd never seen
		 her drink at all), then vomitting in a corner and being helped up to her room by Maya.
		-Sarge and I paced ourselves a bit better, and sat in the common room a while longer,
		 listening to the towns rumors and news.
			-Apparently the mayor has a new limp he's not saying anything about.
			-Sarge was quite the hit, with several people stopping by, asking him about his origins
			 and if he knew of any dragons around the area.
				-No dragons near that he knows, and he's from Stormreach, a militiaman tranformed
				 to what he is in the name of war. Previously, he'd been some kind of catman.
		-Eventually, even we turned in for the night, resting before we travel to the cave tomorrow.


TODO:
	-Shopping before setting out? You've got a number of items of interest below.
		-MW Composite longbow and the haversack?
		-_Probably_ not enough time for Jade to craft something, before visiting the cave?
		-You have a small bit of loot from the guards to sell too.


9/7/22: Squeezing Cash from Dwarves
	-The next morning, we all slowly trickled back down to the common room for breakfast, save Jade,
	 who Maya said was still feeling quite sick.
	-There, between mouthfuls of excellent bacon (of provenance still unknown to me), we discussed
	 our next move.
	-Still intent on seeing what this "river ham" is about, we decided we'd see to provisions (and
	 arms) for an exepedition.
		-Maya spoke with the innkeep, asking him for recommendations for armorers and purveyors of
		 enchantments.
		-We then took his advice, and sought out the Vault of Miredhel, an arms merchant.
			-We also had Rusty meet us there with the equipment from the late guards, procuring some
			 loose change.
			-As we walked in, there was a jerk-y elf arguing with the dwarven proprietor.
				-He was complaining he'd been ripped off by the dwarf in question, sold a defective
				 bow. I could see he was full of shit, though, so I jumped in on the dwarf's side
				 of things (I _may_ also have had my eye on a discount).
			-He talked me into a masterwork darkwood bow (530 gp.).
			-He had a range in back, for me to try it out, and I did some schmoozing as we walked
			 back there.
			-Eventually I talked _him_ into a 5% discount.
			-Maya then inquired after her own purchase, a dwarf-wrought shield, getting a darkwood
			 piece herself.
		-Next stop was an alchemist, then, Maya apparently being interested in some healing potions
		 (prudent!).
			-Appropriate for a barkeep's recommendation, the shop apparently specialized in hangover
			 cures, so we made sure to bring a course back for Jade.
			-Maya got some healing potions and sunrods.
			-The alchemist also recommended a provisioner.
		-Rusty still hadn't arrived with the equipment we meant to sell, though, so we figured we
		 better check on him.
			-Taking the lift up, we found Rusty arguing with the dwarf manning the top of it.
			-He was clearly trying to shake Rusty down, demanding 100 gp. to go down it with his
			 "freight".
			-Maya, Nkondi, and I began to tear into him.
				-Aghast, Maya asked the dwarf, "You don't want people below to know what you're
				 doing up here, taking advantage of travelers. . ."
				-"Ever seen the inside of a dwarven prison? I have. . ." I chimed in.
				-Pretty quickly he was sputtering, and agreed to wave the fee for us, if we would
				 just keep our mouths shut.
				-Not content, I continued pressuring the dwarf, saying, "That's not good enough. We
				 need some recompense for our time, here. Do you know the value of the business deal
				 you've risked by hassling our courier?"
				-"50 gold pieces," Nkondi finished for me, "And a finger for each gold you're short."
				-He gave in pretty quickly, tossing us his purse, which Nkondi carefully counted.
					-He also agreed to free lift rides, and gave us his name (at knife point),
					 Imundos.
		-Back down the lift, then, and off to the provisioner.
			-Walking inside the marked shop, we were greeted by the aroma of various cured meats.
			-Nkondi purchased a _huge_ amount of "Pemmican", having most of it delivered to the ship,
			 to serve as rations.
			-Aside from strange, dried meats, they also had the sort of magic bag I was looking for,
			 and I picked up a Handy Haversack.
	-(We then paused there, Jake being short on time, post-wedding, and several people having to
	  bow out. We'll set out for the cave next time.)


TODO:
	-(DONE!) We still need to do XP for last session. Jake said he'd post it in Discord.


9/21/22:
    -We followed the directions of the dwarven adventurers, flying our ship to wetlands studded with
     rocky outcroppings, themselves pockmarked by caves.
        -It was a day and a half's flight from the dwarven city of Sharaar Kol.
        -We picked a likely seeming set of caves, based on our directions, and brought the ship
         down low.
        -We decided to leave Rusty guarding the the airship, and to keep it circling.
            -If he runs into anything he can't handle, he's to flee with it to Sharaar Kol, but is
             otherwise to look out for our signal or the flight-capable Sarge.
        -Sarge was first overboard, scouting the site from the air, while the rest of us lowered
         rope ladders and climbed down.
        -As we descended, Sarge pointed out a nearby cave mouth streaked with unusual colors.
    -Approaching the indicated cave mouth, we could indeed see it covered in. . . something.
        -There were streaks of various bright colors leading into the cave, sometimes seeming solid
         and sometimes. . . flowing?
        -Maya said it felt chaotic, perhaps magic aligned to that axis. She mumbled something about
         weapons from "The Great War".
        -As we stepped inside, we could hear the noise of. . . something, scurrying away from us,
         deeper into the caves.
        -Listening closely, I could also hear a buzzing? I asked if anyone else heard bees, but the
         mystery was soon revealed as first one, then another blue lizard stepped into the circle of
         our light, electricity crackling and arcing along their bodies.
            -Their veins also pulsed with a greenish light.
        -As they scurried towards us, one of them snapping at Sarge, I stepped behind our scaled
         defender, and loosed an arrow at the scaly thing snapping at him.
        -The arrow struck home, wounding the dog-sized beast, but the wound also sprayed something
         noxious looking, eating into the stone at Sarge's feet, sizzling.
        -Sarge whipped a frosty magical orb at it for it's trouble.
        -As the second one joined the fray, electricity began to arc between the two lizards,
         catching Sarge with a jolt.
        -I backed away from the melee as Nkondi joined it, and, between the two of us, we dropped
         the first of the lizards.
        -Sarge continued hurling magical orbs at the remaining lizard while it raced toward me.
        -I got to do some lightening dodging, and did so flawlessly. Like ballet.
        -This went on for some time, longer than I would have liked, but I eventually pinned the
         second lizard to the cavern floor too, scoring both kills!
    -After the lizard battle, both Maya and Sarge reported difficulties with their magics.
        -Nkondi, though, said he felt none such. Perhaps something specific to the arcane? Maybe
         tied to the strange veins of color?
        -Maya explored that last hypothesis, holding a hand against one vein, and Jade soon joined
         her in examining it with a lense she removed from her pack.
        -They deemed it. . . something, with simultaneously wild and powerful magic flowing through
         it, but didn't know if it was related to our arcanists' difficulties.
        -Jade said something about a "fish" in the "stream", and said she thought it might be our
         "river ham"?
        -Nkondi, though, hit on the interesting idea of _following_ this "stream". Guided by Jade's
         monocole and Nkondi's spirit sight, we followed it through the Easternmost of two passages,
         deeper into the caves.
    -As we followed this stream of magic, Nkondi, in the lead, was surprised by an assault by. . .
     something, a blob of grayish ooze.
        -It was disgusting, and Jade warned us it can dissolve stuff, but was also quickly dispatched
         by a hail of projectiles from Jade, Maya, and myself.
        -Poking around in it with a quickly dissolving arrow, it seemed we were not it's first prey,
         but nothing in the acidic mess seemed to have remained intact.
    -As we followed the "stream" deeper from there, the natural cavern walls gave way to worked
     stone, worn and of an ancient vintage.
        -We even spotted recent footprints in the ancient dust and debris, of a size with the dwarven
         adventurers who set us down this trail.
    -The corridor terminated in a cave-in, with a small opening that someone flexible enough might
     be able to slip through.
        -This fit the description we were given, of the passage that forced the dwarven rogue to go
         it alone.
        -I thought I might be able to make it work, but wasn't keen on repeating that dwarf's
         mistake. The others were skeptical, and Nkondi wasn't able to get through after giving it
         a shot.
        -Jade confidently asserted that such construction usually includes escape tunnels and other
         back-up passages, for just such problems, and, tapping away at the filthy flagstone floor,
         she suggested we try digging downward.
        -Maya wasn't too keen on labor, and kept volunteering to "keep watch", but _did_ have a 
         pickaxe and shovel, which the rest of us took turns digging.
        -Breaking throught the flooring, we found that, indeed, there was a passage beneath us,
         which we climbed down into via a rope.
    -As we moved through this new passage, Maya reported further difficulties with her magics, and
     a test blast indeed looked a bit strange, feathering and forking as it flashed forward from her
     hands.
    -Nkongi, apparently lazy, asked if we could take a break and rest a while.
        -A bit of ribbing him ensued, but we did agree it would be best to be at our full strength
         before encountering the river ham.
        -The ship not being _that_ far, we indulged him, and opted to rest on the ship.
            -Anything in these chambers has already had ample time to prepare a defense already
             anyways
        -As we walked back through the caverns, a huge insect of some kind sprung up from the loose
         rubble at Sarge's feet, biting down on his arm.
        -Maya blasted it in response, and I stabbed it's brain with my brain.
        -That last pissed it _right_ off, and, tunneling into the loose debris of the tunnel floor,
         it burst up from beneath my feet, crushing me around the waist with one of it's enormous
         claws.
        -While I was shouting curses, my fellows battered away at it (thankfully missing me), and a
         spell from Sarge felled it before it could _completely_ crush the life out of me.
    -Well, _now_ I desperately wanted to rest a bit, and we hustled back through the remainder of
     the caverns, and flagged down Rusty aboard the ship.
        -A night's rest and all my healing belt's charges for the day had me right as rain, though!
        -Jade seemed to have a less restful night, though, looking a bit haggard around the mess
         table for breakfast. She mentioned a dream and insisted that, "We really need to go kill
         that fish thing now."
    -We then repeated the previous day's journey down deep, retracing our steps.
        -This time, the caverns were quiet, and we were soon back to our dig site.
        -The hole we left also seemed thankfully undisturbed.
    -Travelling through our uncovered passage, it led to a grate, opening onto some chamber
     above, from which a faint light eminated.
            -"A grate. . . Shit! We're in a sewer. Jade!" I yelled. "Escape passage my ass. . ."
        -Sarge melted the grate with an acidic spell, and we climbed up into some kind of
         half-ruined chamber.
        -The glow came from a hallway leading away from the grate, and we turned to walk in that
         direction.
        -As we did, though, Jade, in the rear, was swarmed by a squeaking mass of rats.
            -Rats with. . . transparent heads? We could see their _brains_.
        -I quickly found myself stunned by a wave of psychic turmoil from the swarm of rats, along
         with most of the rest of our party.
        -Sarge was still moving, though, and, barking a spell, blasted the rats with a flaming orb.
            -It's impact was very limited, though, knocking out only a rat or two.
        -Maya too tried to fight rats with fire, lighting a torch and hurling it at the swarm.
            -The rats seemed unafraid of the flames, though, and, what's more, moved with a sinister
             degree or intelligence and coordination.
        -All through that, the rats bit at Jade, beginning to devour the stunned artificer.
        -Mumbling an apology to Jade, Sarge produced a more effective _fan_ of flames, with another
         spell.
            -_That_ finally wiped out a huge swathe of the rats, though some still remained, and a
             badly burned Jade crumpled.
        -Maya then ran forward, pulling Jade out of the swarm of rats, and towards us.
        -Sarge and Maya then saw to healing Jade, while the rats unfortunately swarmed Maya.
        -The rats at least being on someone less critically injured now, Sarge against unleashed
         a wave of flames against them (and Maya).
        -Maya kept her feet and finished a remaining few rats with her sickle.
        -The rest of us eventually shook our heads a bit, and soon I was healing Maya with my Healing
         Belt while Sarge did the same for Jade.
    -The direction the rats came from was barred by a portculis, so we took the only other option,
     walking towards the light.
        -The light turned out to issue from a (seemingly everburning) torch, in a large room to the
         West.
        -On the floor of the room was a skeleton, it's skull run through by a rusted sword.
            -The skeleton was tall, dead, and looted. Eight feet, thoroughly, and thoroughly.
        -The everburning torch sat on a plinth, with two smaller ones surrounding it, bearing gems.
            -Examining the gems they each bore a logo, and the initials "MODD" in an ancient dialect of
             Common.
                -Maya mentioned something about the logo being associated with a manufacturer of
                 airship weapons.
            -Maya was surprisingly quick in collecting both the torch and the gems, for a noblewoman.
            -As she did so, she also started. Pawing at the wall, a twist of one stone revealed a
             hidden passage.
    -As the hidden passage opened, a torrent of noise was released, like rushing water.
        -Our arcanists both winced, and looked confused. They said that the corruption of their
         magics had escalated.
        -Nkondi also said that he detected an aberration ahead, suggesting it was the brain.
        -He and Sarge rushed forward, with the rest of us pausing only a moment before following (I
         to manifest a Force Screen).
        -The passage led to the largest chamber yet, through which flowed a glowing green river,
         perhaps comprised of magic itself.
        -I also felt a. . . tug, on all enchanted items I bore, towards the river. . .
        -Adding to the glow, all four corners of the room held pylons, shedding their own fluid
         green glow.
        -In the river, I could see clumps of seemingly floating stonework, and something that could
         indeed be described as ham-like, which quickly disappeared beneath the green fluid.
        -Jade stepped forward, readying her crossbow, and when the thing emerged again a moment
         later, she hit it with a crossbow bolt.
        -The ham-brain (it clearly appeared to be a brain, albeit a bit. . . pickled) manifested
         some kind of power but, well, I don't know psionics (I _am_ psionic), and didn't really
         pay much attention in class anyways.
        -Whatever it did, it then disappeared back beneath the rushing liquid.
        -Maya then pointed out a glowing glyph on the back wall of the chamber, across the torrent,
         and, shouting that, "We should destroy the glyph!" she rushed to the river's edge, near one
         of the pieces of floating stonework.
        -Nkondi then cast a spell of his own, and Jade, touched by the magic and suddenly quick as
		 a striking snake, launched another bolt into the liquid, at where the brain had submerged
		 itself.
        -Sarge, in front of me, was acting decidedly strange. He kept making as if to move, only the
         jerk back, as if warring with himself.
        -Remember the jailed dwarf's tale, I called out, "Sarge is acting strangely! Remember the
         dwarf's story, and beware mind control!"
        -I then darted back down the secret passage, ducking around a corner and hiding, my bow
         ready for the creature's return.
        -Peaking around the corner, I watched Maya leap, from bank to stone to bank, heading for the
         glyph.
        -Nkondi hurled a rock into the liquid, shouting that the brain was there.
        -_Something_ then won Sarge's internal war, and he unleashed a wave of flames at Jade's back.
            -Jade went down, charred, but that was only the beginning of our problems.
            -The spell appeared to go wrong, as the flames changed color and curled, seemingly
             burning away at reality itself.
            -The world around us. . . shifted, the river and chambers around us replaced with a
             slope covered in immaculately white snow.
                -Can Sarge even _do_ that? Or does this have something to do with the strangeness
                 of arcane magic here?
        -Well, the river-ham-brain now being out of sight. . . somewhere, it's river replaced by
         snow-covered stone, I elected to sneak up behind our enscrolled dragon-man, and shove him.
            -I did manage to creep up on him, but shoving with all the force I could muster barely
             rocked the formidable Sarge, who then turned towards me snarling.
        -Meanwhile, over his shoulder, I could see Maya blasting away at the glyph with her eldritch
         energies.
        -Then, also over his shoulder, I could see Nkondi rushing towards Sarge's turned back (copy
         cat. . .).
            -Taking my opportunity, I sidestepped, sticking my foot out in the process.
            -Nkondi shoved Sarge back down the hall, and my outstretched foot sent him sprawling.
        -There, on the ground, Sarge seemed to struggle more internally, blood now dripping from a
         nostril. Appearing to come to his senses for a moment, he took the hard core route out,
         raising his head, and then slamming it back down, face first, against the now-rocky floor,
         rendering himself unconscious.
        -I ducked behind one of the pylons, hiding and readying my bow for another shot.
        -Meanwhile, I could see Maya scraping away at the glyph with her sickle, finally earning a
         flash of light, as the glyph dissolved.
        -Bare moments later, a glowing humanoid appeared, radiant sigils circling her head.
        -"This area is being quarantined, on behalf of the church of Mystra. Leave at once!" the
         figure intoned.
            -She then began to mumble a bit, saying something about how, "Something must have gone
             wrong with the detection spells. . ."
            -Seeing Sarge unconscious on the ground, she tried again, "_Can_ you leave the area?"
             "Uh, well," I responded, "He's enscrolled by the beast that was living in this torrent
              of magic. I think it's still here somewhere. . . "
             "Ah. I may be able to do something about that," she replied.
            -Striding over to Sarge, she bent down and lifted his head, examining his eyes. Nodding,
             she barked a few arcane syllables, and then pronounced the curse lifted. "Can you now
             wake him?" she asked.
            -Maya with a glint in her eye, responded, "Well, we've run through all our potions. . ."
                -I chose not to bring up the contents of my backback.
            -Sighing, she pulled out a round of potions, handing one to each of us, telling us they
             were of Cure Serious wounds.
            -Pouring one down Sarge's throat soon had him back on his feet, and apparently possessed
             of his own will again.
            -"Now, will you please get out of here?" she asked.
             ". . . well," Maya replied, "It took us quite a lot to get here. To leave empty handed,
              it would devestate us. . ."
             "Yeah," I joined in, "and we _did_ do you a favor here. This mess apparently escaped
              your notice until Maya scraped that glyph off the wall. . . We've all done a lot of
              good here, and could easily all walk away happy."
             "Fifty thousand gold worth of rubies should do it," Nkondi suggested, finishing the
              routine.
             "_Fifty thousand_?!?" she sputtered, "That's too much!"
             "Well, you said you followed Mystra?" I asked, looking to compromise. "What of magic?
              Not all rewards gleam, and you follow the goddess of the arcane. . ."
             ". . . fine. My offer is twelve thousand. And, as to magic, here. . ." Incanting a few
             syllables and waving her arms, magical energies flowed out from the woman, reaching out
             to each of us. "There," she said, "Each of you has now been granted Darkvision."
             "Uh, wow! Yeah, that'll do!" I replied.
            -Nkondi was less satisfied, though. "What of me?" he asked. "I could already see in the
             dark!"
             "That's. . ." she began.
             "You owe me," he interrupted. "A favor then? To be named later?"
             ". . . A small one," she finished, eliciting a nod from Nkondi.
            -Turning to the rest of us again, she said, "Here. Take this," tossing a small stone to
             Maya. "Despite being. . . demanding, you've were able to make it here. Our church has
             uses for those with your skills of infiltration. With that marked stone, I can contact
             you again, if we have need of your services. . . Now, please, leave this place."
             "It's been a pleasure doing business with you!" I replied.
			-"Watch out for floating brains!" I called out over my shoulder, as we turned and walked
			 back out of the passageway.


TODO:
    -(Done!) Darkvision! Record it somewhere, ask about range, whether it's a permanent spell, etc.
        -Probably removes the temptation to take a second level of Shadowdancer.


10/5/22:
	-Whatever happened to import some snow, it also disappeared a good chunk of the caves and earth
	 around us, leaving the area we were in open to the sky.
		-Well, time to signal Rusty!
		-Nkondi magicked up some kind of buzzard, and delivered Rusty a note.
		-While the Chosen of Mystra examined the area and inscribed various runes on things, Rusty
		 brought the airship in low and lowered some rope ladders.
	-Once back aboard the airship, we discussed where we'd go next. Maya still had the business of
	 the signet rings in Sharaar Kol, so we took the ship back up and headed again in the direction
	 of the dwarven city.
	-It was a couple days' flight back, and we arrived at the city's air port mid-morning.
	-Soon, we were back down to the trade city, shopping and drinking.
		-First step was to unload these gems. They seemed like they were worth a decent chunk of
		 change, but probably more for their historical significance, necessitating a particular
		 buyer.
		-I wasn't sure where to go, but Maya claimed to know of a local scholar, a student of
		 history, but one who resides in Sharaar Kol's _lower_ city.
		-So, we walked up to the passage to the lower city, and asked it's guards.
		-They told us outsiders could gain access by visiting the customs house, a short walk away.
		-Thanking them, that's just where we went.
			-There, to access the lower city, we were made to swear three oaths on various sacred
			 objects in the office, promising to do no violence but in self-defense, to obey the
			 king and leave when asked, and to not steal during our visit.
			-As I swore each oath, I could feel magic washing over me. Clearly there was some. . .
			 enforcement, behind these oaths.
			-After swearing, and a lot of paperwork, we were each given a green, glowing badge to
			 wear, one which we were told would last a week, and need to be renewed thereafter.
			-Thanking the customs agent, we then headed into the lower city.
	-The lower city proved to be dominated by a massive, mechanized forge.
		-Maya, meanwhile, proved to not know where we were going, but at least knew a name.
		-So, we asked around the lower city, and soon got directions to our scholar.
		-Entering his shop, we could see we came to the right place. Maya pointed at some diagrams
		 and a strange, brass device on display, which bore a similar logo to the gem.
		-The proprietor proved a bit cantankerous, but we were able to talk him into a paying a
		 premium for the gems, 550 gold apiece.
		-We did that in part by raising the prospect of future expeditions that he'd be "funding",
		 potentially uncovering more such, if the matter proved lucrative. . .
			-He seemed somewhat receptive to the idea.
		-Maya also took a moment to speak to the man about counterfeiters, seeking a lead on her
		 rings.
			-That bore some fruit, with him mentioning a group, the "Quick Hammers", who'd been
			 accused of. . . mislabeling, in the past.
		-We also took the opportunity to pawn that everburning torch off on the guy for more than
		 it's worth, playing up it's "historical significance" as well.
	-Walking out of the shop, I was in a great mood, running gold through my hands.
		-"Well, we made out quite well!" I said. "Here's your shares folks. . . Wait, where's
		  Nkondi?"
		-He was nowhere to be found. Ominously, though, there were a lot of guards moving around
		 with some haste on the streets.
		-Uh oh. I questioned whether we should run towards or away from this trouble, but most of
		 the others didn't want Nkondi out of sight too long.
		-Asking around didn't reassure me. Apparently some "pale, babbling man" had taken someone
		 hostage. . .
		-Hmm. . . now I was definitely leaning towards running in the opposite direction, or at
		 least exercising some discretion. In fact, we could go hole up in a bar! _Real_ discreet.
		-Sarge took that and ran with it, saying, "Yeah. . . we could find a cop bar, see if we
		 hear anything about what's going on. . ."
		 "Uh, yeah! Exactly what I was getting at. . ."
		-I then sought out a relatively idle guard, asking him for a bar recommendation, whatever
		 _he_ likes. . .
		-The guard steered us to a place called "The Plane Tankard", apparently specializing in
		 exotic ales.
		-Thanking him and heading there, my ruse paid off: the place was indeed full of off-duty
		 guards.
		-I asked the barkeep there for a recommendation, winding up with a round of some vile
		 Abyssal ale, albeit one that turned our eyes a pleasing shade of fiery red.
		-I set into drinking, and Maya got herself set up to perform in the tavern, talking with
		 the barkeep, and then telling a story, with accompaniment, for the tavern's patrons.
			-Some historical tale, touching on Sharaar Kol, it seemed to get a welcome reception.
			-Afterwards, she'd won several dwarven admirers. She spent some time talking with them,
			 then came back with news.
			-She'd learned that there were rumors among the guards that these Quick Hammers had
			 bribed the guard captain, which is why they remain in operation.
			-Perhaps we could look into this, discover some proof, and rob the miscreants of their
			 patronage and protection.
			-She'd also heard that the king can free us from the oaths required to get us to the
			 lower city, if he could be convinced to support the investigation.
		-Before we could take that idea much further, though, a guard rushed in, calling up the
		 off-duty guards, for some emergency. "He cut off his ear!" the frantic guard shouted.
			-'Dric's crystal cock! This was turning into a mess. I wanted out of the splash zone.
		-Well, we (unwisely) followed the guards, who rushed to a scrum of their fellows gathered
		 in the temple district.
			-From their shouted orders, translated and summarized Maya and Jade, Nkondi had taken
			 a high priest of Moradin hostage, demanding the priest's weight in platinum in return,
			 because. . . the city is corrupt or something?
			-Yep, sounds like Nkondi.
		-So we sought out where the kidnapping was said to have taken place, hoping to track down
		 Nkondi (his ransom demands coming via notes discovered only after he'd gone).
			-Soon, we were following foot prints that suddenly ended, and looking about at nearby
			 magical auras.
			-Jade pronounced that there was a faint necromantic aura in the area, something she
			 claimed was residue from the "Sunstroke" spell. From her description of how it
			 "dehydrates" it's victims, that does sound like Nkondi.
			-"And a transmutation one!" Maya chimed in. "Traces of something related to
			  concealment. . ."
			-Following some traces of the latter, we wound up a tunnel into the rock of the
			 mountain, apparently a circuitous route up towards the airship docks. . .
			-Shit. Pale motherfucker better not steal my boat. . .
		-Rushing up to the airship docks, we found several guards strewn about, passed out, and
		 I began to run for my ship.
			-I did a quick look around the ship, though, didn't turn up Nkondi. "What about those
			 of you who can see magic?" I asked. "Anything?"
			-Maya and Jade just continued carefully inspecting the ship and it's contents.
			-Eventually, Maya called my name, across the deck from me.
			 "Yes? Find something?"
			 "I found Nkondi."
			 "What?!? Where?"
			-Nkondi then stood up from a barrel near Maya, saying, "Good. You're here. Tell me, how
			  much do you think _this_ one is worth?" as he gestured to Maya.
			-". . . about 1,000 platinum, if I had to guess. . ." I looked rather thoughtful. Still,
			 I said, "It was rather bad form pulling something like this. . . without talking to the
			  Captain."
			 "If I'd asked, you would have said no. Now, you're already accomplices, and _have_ to
			  join me in this."
			-I didn't respond. . . verbally. Instead, an audible hum began to grow around me, but
			 Nkondi appeared to shake off my attempt to crush his mind. "I've had _enough_ of being
			  told what to do!" I shouted.
			-My other companions quickly joined me in the attack.
			-Nkondi, for his part, tried to grab at Maya's sickle, but she shoved him and he went
			 sprawling.
			-I loosed shots at Nkondi as I dove for cover. Taking a quick breather behind it,
			 though, I noticed I could hear an irregular. . . clicking, coming from below decks.
			-The source was quickly revealed as a 7' tall knife-weilding insect lept out from the
			 deck's hatch, and began to furiously slash Nkondi to pieces.
				-Well, huh.
			-I was still hidden, and figured I'd give some thought to the situation while I could.
			-Peeking out, the insect stood there, chittering arythmically, in what might be a
			 language. In a moment, though, it began to dig through the Nkondi chunks, shaking them
			 free from Nkondi's clothes and other belongings.
			-It then looked up at those visible, and divied those belongings up into five piles.
			-Seeing those signs of commerce, I emerged from hiding and strolled towards the
			 creature. Looks like I can work with this. . .
			-As I approached, though, the bug whirled to face me and rushed over. . . sniffing at
			 me?
			-"Well, hello! Thanks for the help, there! Now, what are you and what are you doing on
			  my ship?"
			 "You queen?" the thing responded.
			 "Ah, well, I do like to think that I've got a rather regal bearing, yes. But, no one
			  has ever named me 'queen'."
			 "This is your hive?"
			 "Oh! I think I see what you mean. Yeah, this is my ship."
			 "You are queen. I join you?"
			 "Well, you _did_ just create an opening _and_ prove your worth while doing it. I
			  wouldn't mind having something like yourself between me and the enemy. . ."
			 "Yes. Protect queen."
			 "OK, yeah, I can work with this. . ."
			 "To-Cao", it said, pointing to itself.
			 "Fred the Red!" I said, bowing. "A pleasure!"
			-While I was having the hear to heart, though, dwarven guards were rushing across the
			 docks, towards are ship.
				-Running up the gangplank, they took in the sight of Sarge, who had walked over to
				 the priest and was tending to his injuries, while I pointed at the pile of Nkondi-
				 chunks, saying, "There's your perpetrator. . ."
				-They of course had questions for us.
					-We explained that, hearing of the kidnapping and the description of it's
					 culprit, we suspected our "deckhand", and, fearing it's theft, rushed to our
					 ship.
				-They were pretty willing to accept our answers, and we soon saw why, as they
				 ushered forward another priest, to question Nkondi's corpse, via a spell.
					-His answers, truth likely compelled of his spirit, quite nicely exonerated us.
				-Still, they insisted we come back to their guardpost, to answer a few more
				 questions, eliciting mostly compliant shrugs from the lot of us.
				-"Is the, uh, big cricket with you?" one of the guards asked.
				 "He's a. . . new acquaintance," I said, "But he witnessed the end of things. Bring
				  him along."
					-If To-Cao is as good as his word, good to have him watching my back, there.
			-Following them back to their guard post, where they had us swear yet another oath, this
			 time one to speak truly.
				-We agreed, but what followed was a series of careful evasions, mostly on Maya's and
				 my parts, in which we successfully cast Nkondi as a barely known deckhand, and
				 ourselves as upstanding traders who had _nothing_ to do with the recent troubles in
				 our last port of Sasserine.
	-Walking out of the guard post, I turned to the others and said, "Well! That went about as well
	  as could be expected! As our next order of business, I guess we have more loot to attend to!
	  Then, some spending money in hand, well. . . I'm not sure, is a funeral or celebration to
	  called for?"
		-I imagine the answering silence was them stunned by my brilliant leadership in these trying
		 times.


TODO:
	-Do some shopping during downtime!
		-(DONE!) Get the buckler.
			-Got a _+1_ buckler approved. Spend the gold and apply it!


10/19/22:
	-We decided to spend a few days hanging around town.
		-Maya also suggested some relaxation might be prudent. . . spacing out our exploits a bit,
		 lest we get run out of _another_ city.
		-Jade wanted to do some magic crafting, and requested some inpiration and oversight from
		 the captain, charming muse that I am.
			-To-Cao and I accompanied Jade on a supply run, to pick up more magic reagents.
			-While we were out, Jade suddenly paused in a square, staring off into space.
			-She's _normally_ pretty spacey, but this was a bit much, even for her.
			-"Jade? What's going on?" I asked.
			 "Someone is. . . sending me a message," she responded.
			 "Huh? Oh, some kind of magic?"
			 She nodded, and said, "I'm not sure who's sending it, though."
			 "Well, can't you see magic? With that monocle or something?"
			 "Oh! Yeah, here. . ."
			-She then set about looking around with her monocole, eventually pointing down one of
			 the streets.
			 "Lead the way, Jade!" I said.
			-Following her, she led us to a stone apartment building. Trying it, though, the door
			 was locked.
			-"I can help with this," To-Cao volunteered. "I will grab you two and jump up."
			 "Uh. . ." Jade responded, "Do you maybe have some rope or something like that instead?"
			-To-Cao nodded curtly, and drew out a coil from his pack. Stepping back a bit, he took
			 a running leap up onto the side of the building, hanging from a window ledge with his
			 claws.
			-That was rapidly beginning to attract some attention from passerby, though, so I
			 stepped in. Addressing those who'd stopped and begun to whisper, I said, "Hi folks!
			 Nothing to worry about here! This is the trial run of our window cleaning service!"
			-I sold it pretty well, and soon they were nodding and murmering about how, "Oh! Yeah,
			 the windows down here _do_ get filthy. All that gray soot from the forge! How much are
			 you guys charging?"
			-Soon, the onlookers were wandering off, with a few agreeing to leave word at the inn
			 we'd stayed at, to hire us once we're fully open for business. . .
			-As that calmed down, I turned to Jade and asked, "So, where _exactly_ was that magic
			 coming from again.
			-She pointed to a window on the fifth floor, and I relayed to same to our resident
			 mantis man, saying, "To-Cao! That's the customer's window over there!"
			-To-Cao attempted to leap from his perch to that window, but missed, and fell to the
			 cobbles below.
			-I and several onlookers rushed over to him, and I reassured them that we had healing
			 magic for just such accidents. Soon, with my healing belt, I had him back on his. . .
			 legs, I guess?
			-He then made several more attempts, each similarly unsuccessful despite his nimbleness,
			 though thankfully less injurious. Inscrutable though the insect is, it was still quite
			 clear that he was growing _very_ frustrated.
			-While that was all going on, _I_ began to hear. . . whispers. Presumably whatever
			 spell Jade had heard. We had a conversation: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/1032450956966764586
				DMJake — Today at 7:31 PM
				Your friend doesn't listen very well
				maybe you will be more reasonable
				I've seen evidence that your group can do things, maybe messy, but useful
				Peaked — Today at 7:36 PM
				We're indeed quite capable. New business, though, goes through me. What have you got in mind?
				DMJake — Today at 7:37 PM
				Your friend makes me magic items, I pay him. Maybe I make friends with some politicians in Sasserine?
				It would be a shame if something were to happen to that ship of yours
				I don't want that to happen
				Peaked — Today at 7:39 PM
				(No further response from me, I think.)
			-While I grappled with that, someone had shut from within the window To-Cao had been
			 aiming for.
			-He wasn't going to let that stop him and, finally making his second jump successfully,
			 he crashed through the glass, to the sound of shouting from inside the window.
			-That shouting quickly escalated to a dwarf leaning out the window, yelling "Guards!
			 Guards!"
			-A group of heavily armored guards was soon shoving its way through the crowd and
			 towards the building, while I and Jade sauntered off, in the other direction, whistling.
			-To-Cao soon emerged from the buidings door, where he was apprehended by the guards.
			-After a brief discussion, they led him away, down the street and towards both us and
			 a nearby guard post.
			-As they walked past us, To-Cao locked eyes with me, and began to chitter.
			-Seeing this, the guards all turned to look at me as well. . .
			-Well, so much for evading notice. "Oh! Are you taking him to the hospital?" I asked them.
			 "Queen?" To-Cao asked me.
			 "Are you who he's talking about?" a guard then asked too.
			 "Yeah, yeah, he works for me. We were rushing to get him some help! After the accident!"
			 "The accident? This creature was caught breaking into a home!" the guard said.
			 "Oh! No, this is all a big misunderstanding," I bluffed. "We're _window washers_. He
			  was setting up our rigging when he slipped, and crashed through the window! We ran
			  off in search of a priest! Though, To-Cao, looking at you, you're in pretty good shape
			  for all that glass! Some perks to that carapace, huh?"
			-The guard then interrupted my rambling, saying, "Well, whatever you were doing here,
			 he's going to have to come to the station. We'll discuss the matter further, there. . ."
			 "Sure, sure," I said. "I'll come with. Jade, go let the rest of. . . the company know
			  what happened."
			 She nodded in response, and left.
			-They led us over to a guard post, where the ranking officer on duty recognized us,
			 saying, "Wait, that's the creature that was involved in the high priest's kidnapping!"
			 "The creature that _saved_ the high priest," I clarified.
			 "Well, hmph, I guess we'll see about that, now that he's breaking into buildings!"
			 "Breaking in?!?" I protested. "We were washing windows! I was helping to set him up
			  with gainful employment, utilizing his. . . unique talents. There was an accident,
			  though. . ."
			-I argued a while further with the guards, who wanted us to remain here while they
			 fetched the building's owner and got statemens, insisting also that To-Cao stay in one
			 of the cells.
			-While I waited there, pondering my next move, I began to receive some more magic
			 messages: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/1032458001254195261
				DMJake — Today at 7:59 PM
				You get a new whisper in your head, you know the guard captain is a friend
				Peaked — Today at 8:06 PM
				I do like working with friends! You've rather started things off on the wrong foot, though, making threats. Fortunately, here's your opportunity for a showing of good faith. . .
				DMJake — Today at 8:08 PM
				I don't like to make threats, but you got so aggressive. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
				Peaked — Today at 8:10 PM
				You don't, and can't. Hence the need for "good faith". Business requires a degree of trust, after all. (Diplomacy check?)
				DMJake — Today at 8:10 PM
				yup
				Peaked — Today at 8:10 PM
				33
				DMJake — Today at 8:11 PM
				Fair enough, your friend will be free within the hour
			-The voice in my head was a good as it's word, and the guards soon released To-Cao from
			 his cell and us from the station, after collecting a fee for the damages.
				-"You're going to be paying _at least_ half of this," I grumbled to To-Cao.
			-The rest of the crew met us outside the guard post, having apparently come to offer us
			 aid.
			-"The matter is resolved for now," I said, "But Jade never did get her materials. How
			  about you two, Maya and Sarge, accompany her to the store, while I take To-Cao back
			  to the ship. . . check in on Rusty and all. . ."
			 "Uh, sure, we can do that," Maya replied, "But there was another matter we wanted to
			  talk to you about, Fred. I was hoping you could help me in looking further into this
			  'Quick Hammers' matter, to find where they meet."
			 "I've got some thoughts on that, actually. We can talk more back on the ship."
	-Back at the ship, we discussed the matter of the "Quick Hammers", and I revealed to the
	 rest that they'd contacted _me_ after Jade.
		-They were up for at least attending the meeting, and as sure as I was that our mystery
		 messenger was associated with the gang.
		-We then fell to discussing the plan, but unfortunately didn't come up with anything
		 revelatory, ultimately deciding we make the meeting and figure it out from there.
	-Roughly three hours later, we were again winding our way back down the stair that led to the
	 lower city, to meet our mystery contact.
		-Passing through the city, we were definitely getting glances from the guards now.
		-Eventually, we reached the meeting point, though, a largely deserted side street.
		-We were soon greeted by two armed and armored dwarves, one of whom called out to us saying,
		 "Here to do business?"
		 "We're always interested in new business, my crew and I," I replied.
		-We engaged in some banter about trust, business, and friendship, and Maya eventually asked
		 of them an introduction, since they clearly knew us.
		 "This is Volkan Mornhammer," replied the dwarf that had been speaking, "And I am Dandruk
		  Quickhammer."
		-We then discussed the business at hand. 
			-Dandruk spoke of how much he valued. . . freedom. Freedom from regulations, and from
			 the cut that those in power demand.
			-He also spoke of craftsmanship, and wanted some proof of Jade's. I offered up my
			 inherited healing belt for inspection, pointing out the fine filigree of it's buckle,
			 but he had something more specific in mind. He suggested a trial, an enchanted silver
			 raven figurine he wanted Jade to make.
			-I handled negotiations (flawlessly, of course), and got the money and soul-stuff
			 required for the item up front, plus an additional 10% gold, "for the lady's time."
			-He agreed rather easily, suggesting both that I'm great at this and that they're very
			 interested in whatever they ultimately want from Jade.
		-I then raised the matter of reaching back out to them, and how we should go about it.
			-He replied that we could meet back here, and asked Jade how long the crafting would
			 take. She said it would be six days, so in six days he said we could meet again.
		-They then turned to leave, and so did we.
	-Back at the ship again, we discussed how that went, and our next move.
		-Seemed pretty good to me, and we now had _lots_ more time to figure out our next move
		 with these folks. Continued business with them also means more opportunities to learn
		 more, and more trust.
	-Jade needed my help and coaching to make the items, so, while she worked on that, Maya
	 went out into the city, to further investigate the Quickhammers, now that we had some names.
		-Coming back to the ship after the first day of that, she told us of what she'd learned.
		-Rumor was, the group was looking to expand to Sasserine, to fill the vacuum left after
		 the Lotus Dragons stopped operating. In service of that, they were stockpiling weapons,
		 particularly silver, and money, as well as hiring people for the expansion.
		-She also got the impression that their numbers in Sharaar Kol were roughly fifteen,
		 currently.
		-Maya also raised another thing she'd like to accomplish while Jade worked: getting a
		 message to her family about what she'd learned thus far.
			-Well, Jade can work on a moving ship, and we have just a bit more time than we'd need
			 to get to Sasserine and back.
			-I wasn't sure that any of the rest of us would be welcome in the city, though, but
			 Maya said we could simply put her in a jolly boat some distance outside the city,
			 and let her row ashore.
				-Sarge also may be able to accompany her, as he rightly claimed he wasn't involved
				 in the famous funeral riot.
				-He and Maya were going to discuss the plan as we traveled to the city.


11/2/22:
	-The night we reach Sasserine, we paused well outside of the city's lagoon, and lowered a jolly
	 boat from the airship, containing Maya and Sarge.
	-Meanwhile, I spent the next day or so heckling Jade as she worked, drinking steadily as I did
	 so.
	-So it was with a hangover I awoke the next morning, with strange voices coming from on deck.
		-Climbing a ladder, I emerged into the sun, blinking, to see Maya, Sarge, and two elves
		 unknown to me.
		-Seeing me, Maya greeted me and introduced me to her lord father and a wizard in service
		 to her house.
		-They were obviously very concerned with Maya's safety, but she was also obviously sticking
		 with us. Her father gave me the 3rd degree, asking about the ship's history, and. . .
		 losses the crew had endured.
			-I hemmed and hawed my way around that last, pointing out that, "No blood has ever been
			 shed aboard this ship, save for that incident with Nkondi. . ."
		-The wizard had questions about the ship, which I took as an excuse for a tour, where I
		 talked his pointy ears off, about the conjured materials and the excellent workmanship
		 characteristic of the products of Edric's domains.
			-The mention of Ed caught his attention. "Oh?" he asked, "You're backed by The
			  Brotherhood?"
			 "You might call them the ship's patrons. . ."
			 "Ah. That'd explain the necromancy, then, if you're tied to the church of Nkisi."
			 "Yeah," I confessed, "It's not totally foriegn to me, but something seems rotton in
			  th church of Nkisi lately. . ."
		-He'd obviously heard something about the mess with Nkondi, and it soon became obvious that
		 Maya had put much of the blame for the Sasserine mess on him. The lord even mentioned
		 she'd claimed he'd enscrolled us, causing much of the trouble.
		-Eventually (more or less) satisfied with his daughter's safety and my "no more necromancers"
		 policy, he drew forth from his pocket a small journal, handing it to me, saying, "This
		  journal is linked to one in my possession. What you write here will be shown to me, across
		  any distance. Keep me aprised as to my daughter's whereabouts."
		 "Oh! A handy thing!" I said. "Maya, I imagined you'd like to keep this in your possession?"
		-That evoked a cold stare from Lord Dracus, and Maya said, "I believe he does indeed mean
		 for _you_ to have it."
		 "Oh. Well, OK!"
		-He then asked that we continue to help with the gang situation, in Sasserine and with the
		 Quickhammers.
			-"We're already in contact with Quickhammers!" I volunteered. "But, what _does_ your
			  house want to do with them?"
			 "Take down their base of operations," he said, "I do not know that _death_ is
			  appropriate. . ."
			 "They've already threatened us with violence," I responded. "I wouldn't imagine this
			  can resolved _without_ further blood. . ."
			-He looked grim, but did not respond to that.
			-"Father," Maya broke in, "Further service should come with some pay. . ."
			 "Of course," he replied, and they fell to discussing what would be customary.
			-After a quick moment, he accepted Maya's suggestion and offered us 10,000 platinum in
			 exchange for our help, a deal I happily accepted.
			-He took a moment to emphasize again that this is a grave matter, and alluded also to a
			 vision Maya had, of some impending doom.
				-"Maya? This is the first I've heard of this?" I asked.
				 "It was last night. We'll talk later."
				 "Very well. . ."
		-After goodbye to his daughter, he and the wizard teleported away.
	-After their departure, Maya filled me in on further details.
		-Beyond the job, Maya had asked her father to help clear our name, laying all the blame for
		 the funeral and on at the feet of Nkondi and "his enchantments."
		-She also filled us in on the vision, which featured tentacles emerging from the water to
		 destroy Sasserine, a great black dragon, and demons.
			-Yep, that's an apocalypse vision alright. . .
		-Finally, Maya updated us on the state of Sasserine, saying that the battle for control of
		 the city's underworld continued and that there was fighting every night in the city.
	-With The Quickhammers our target, we brought the ship about and headed back to Sharaar Kol,
	 discussing during the trip our plan.
		-Maya pointed out that we do have a meeting scheduled, one at which we could perhaps ask to
		 meet with the leaders?
		-"Stand on principle, eh?" I said. "Insist we want to meet who we're doing business with?
		  Not a bad idea. . . We could also play along until hopefully invited to do the same, or
		  offer the ship's service carrying cargo and count on that meaning we need to pick it up
		  from some substantial site under their control?"
		-That all elicited a fair amount of nodding, so I continued, saying, "Well, that's at least
		  several options. We can meet with them and then see what we can make work. Anything else
		  anyone would like to prep for that?"
		 "I would also like talk with high priest we saved," Maya said. "Check on how he's doing
		  after the ordeal, and maybe enlist his aid in our quest."
		 "Good idea!" I replied, "The Quickhammers have a guard captain on their side. Some official
		  backing of our own might stave off some future trouble."
	-On the way back, though, a day or so into the journey, the wind began to pick up.
		-Shouting orders from the ships wheel, we reefed the ships sails.
			-We struggled with one rope in the process, but To-Cao was able to add his formidable
			 strength to that or Rusty and they pulled it taught and brought the sail in.
		-We'd barely breathed sighs of relief when a shout of alarm went up from Rusty.
		-Off the ship's rail, a short distance from him, was a small whirlwind diving seemingly
		 purposefully at the nearby crew.
		-Recognizing something was amiss, I engaged my precognitive insight, which was quickly
		 justified as the whirlwind swept Sarge off the deck and over the side.
			-As it did so, it shouted in Auran, "Free the little ones!"
			-Well, I'm not doing _that_. . .
		-Fortunately, it chose the only one of us with wings, and he was able to glide back over
		 the deck, coming in for an only slightly rough landing.
		-Maya and To-Cao took their revenge on the thing, though, Maya blasting it with fiery energy
		 that set it alight and To-Cao rushing to the rail and hurling something at it.
		-Jade followed that with an arrow. It was less than clear if anything but the fire had
		 harmed it but I shrugged and added and arrow of my own. Amazing as I am, that ended the
		 silly wind, the whirl dissipating and the debris caught in it dropping from the sky.
		-Jade asked why such a thing would attack us. I danced around the issue a bit, but Jade
		 pushed, and I admitted, "Well, you do know this ship runs on bound air elementals, right?"
		 "Oh. Well, yeah, that makes sense."
	-Arriving back at Sharaar Kol, we made our way down to the lower city.
		-We were hassled a bit by the guard, given recent events, but he let _most_ of us down.
			-To-Cao he refused, pointing to the bug's badge, glowing red. "He broke his oath," the
			 guard said, "And won't be allowed to return."
			 "Ah, very well," I said. "To-Cao, you're on duty guarding the ship."
			 His response was some very dejected clicking, but he complied.
		-Once within, we headed straight to the temple, easily identified by it's enormous statue
		 of Moradin.
			-We were stopped by guards at it's doors, saying, "Halt! We've had to increase security,
			  after the recent. . . incident."
			 "Oh, we understand!" I said. "That's actually why we're here. We bore witness to a part
			  of the priest's ordeal, and brought an end to it. We wanted to check in on him, and
			  offer our sympathies!"
			 "Hmph. Well, let me check with the priests. . ."
			-The guard returned a moment later, and admitted us.
			-Within, we met with the priest, who admitted no harm from the ordeal, his faith in
			 Moradin's plan for him being apparently unshakeable.
			-I offered him our sympathies nonetheless.
			-He did ask after To-Cao, "the one who saved me". Maya explained that he'd, "in the
			 course of helping you", broken one of the vows he'd made to enter the city. "Would
			  you be able to help him with that?" she asked the priest.
			 "I suppose I could put in a good word for him. . . if an appropriate donation were
			  made."
			 "Alas," I broke in, "Though To-Cao's people are formidable, they are not wealthy.
			  Perhaps he could atone. . . through service?"
			 "Service? Well. . . yes, that would be. . . appropriate. There is a crew of miners,
			  looking to venture deep into a dangerous section of the mines. They could use
			  guards. . ."
			 "Ah!" I said, "That's definitely within To-Cao's skills, as you've seen."
			 "They mean to leave three days from now. I will make the arrangements, and you shall
			  meet them at first light at the entrance to the mines. Beware, for the drow are 
			  known to haunt that area. . ."
			 "Great!"
			-Maya also took the opportunity to ask him of The Quickhammers.
				-The church apparently looks down on their shoddy workmanship as much as the rest
				 of the city, but added that, "It's not exactly a _crime_. Though, if the rumors
				  are true, there's more to them then just that. . . But, the guards seem to look
				  the other way and the king is pulled in so many directions at once. . ."
				 "Oh!" Maya said suddenly. "Would it be possible to get an audience with the king?
				  I am a scion of House Dracus of Sasserine, here representing my house. . ."
				 "Oh? Before my ordeal, I would have said it was impossible. . . But, since, I seem
				  to have the king's ear whenever I want it."
				 "Would you be able to help me, then?" Maya asked.
				 "Well, the king is in the mines at the moment, surveying the works, but, when he
				  returns this evening, I suppose I could let him know you're here."
				 "That would be great!" I broke in. "You have our thanks!"
				 "And you the blessing of Moradin, my son."
			-We then took our leave of the priest and his temple.
		-Next, Maya wished to pursue some research concerning her vision, and to visit the scholar
		 of her acquaintance, here in the lower city.
			-While she busied herself with that, I busied myself at the bar.


TODO:
	-Items:
		-Get Jade to craft at least a masterwork rapier for you.
			-She now even has Craft Wonderous.
		-Something to deal with undead?
			-Maybe a specific wand?
		-Charisma boosting stuff is a huge deal for you, between skills and power DCs.
		-Dex boosts too, though maybe the runner up behind Charisma.
        -Jade also maxes Concentration, so can craft you an item boosting it.
			-Custom cost:
				Skill bonus (competence):	Bonus squared × 100 gp
				No space limitation:		Multiply entire cost by 2
			-You'd be crafting it too, so you pay half that in gold, and 25th in XP:
				+2: 400 gp., 32 XP
				+3: 900 gp., 72 XP
				+4: 1600 gp., 128 XP
				+5: 2500 gp., 200 XP
	-More dance numbers.
	-Recruit more!
		-The air elemental running your ship?
			-What _would_ level adjustement for an elemental look like?
				-None listed, though could perhaps look at HD, if Jake allows it?
					-Small through Huge air elementals are 2, 4, 8, 16 HD.
			-I think you do speak Auran, for more or less this reason.
	-What do you report, if ever called to do so by those that set you loose with the skyship?
		-Sasserine:
			-Turmoil in the church of Nkisi.
			-Substantial resistance to the current government, and a high degree of corruption.
				-Perhaps an opening for The Brotherhood?
			-Low saturation by the fruits of Edric (never saw an adamantine weapon, etc.).
			-Interesting metal working technology, used to create ultra-light mail.
			-Evidence of a follower of Enilias operating, masquerading as a follower of Shawn.
		-Sharaar Kol:
			-Shit, that river-brain-thing is probably right up Edric's alley.
				-We think we left it encased in rock, where the magic river used to be before that
				 wild magic planar swap happened.
            -There were some other mind-control-y shit down there too, like the rats.
				-Both they and the brain felt like psionics.
			-A river of magic isn't really his domain, but it _is_ something he'd be plenty happy
			 to _consume_. If that can be worked into items. . .
				-It might now be on the plane of Celestia.
			-The Quickhammer organization:
				-Seems to indicate a demand for fake or shoddy good exists. Potentially something
				 exports from Edric's domain could take advantage of (being a source of cheap goods)
				 or preempt (being capable of extraordinary workmanship or materials).
	-Once you get Leadership, what cohort should you get?
		-They'll be level 4 to start, if you indeed get Leadership at 6.
		-CN Gnome Illusionist?
			-Gnome is definitely solid for an illusionist.
				-+1 to Illusion spell DCs.
				-Alchemy bonus is solid for ships too, furnishing novel alchemical weapons and maybe
				 dovetailing with cannons or more traditional seige weapons.
				-If any gnome, then forest gnome seems a no-brainer. It seemingly only has upsides
				 over the default: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gnomes,_Forest_(Race)
				-Considers himself a "pargon of gnomishness".
			-Sorcerer or wizard?
				-Still Spell, etc.?
				-Charisma also:
					-Is the basis for gnome spell-likes.
					-Helps Disguise, a big-deal skill for illusions (though _you_ also help that a ton).
				-Intelligence also:
					-Helps with alchemy.
				-Variant Illusionist wizards are interesting: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/specialistWizardVariants.htm#chainsofDisbelief
					-Chains of Disbelief is super cool, but maybe actually a downside when working
					 with a ship's crew.
					-Shadow Shaper might be worth the hefty price, given how it dovetails with what
					 you do. Precludes the next two options, though.
					-Focused Specialist might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#focused-specialist
					-Gnome Illusionist also looks interesting, especially the first two levels:https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#gnome-illusionist
					-It does seem possible to take both.
				-Sorcerers have their own variants:
					-This list is super useful: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/variant/variantList.html
					-Illusion Sphere might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#socerer-spheres
					-If religious, there's some fun divine variants:
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#divine-companion
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#domain-access
				-Ah, wizards having Scribe Scroll goes well with your UMD score.
				-If a specialist wizard, what two schools do you give up?
					-Necromancy is almost certainly one, for flavor and usefulness both. "What fun
					 are the dead? Even the ones that think just keep going, "Flesshh. . ." or "Blud!"
					-Abjuration is probably the other. Biggest pain is no dispels.
				-Oh, and Gnome Illusionist, discussed above reduces your caster level by 1 for
				 another school. It's attractive, so which one?
					-Divination might be a good fit. Not harmed too much by the level loss, it also
					 fits the carefree, gnomish attitude I'm imagining here.
			-Cat familiar's +3 to Move Silently helps someone who casts invisibility, and fits a ship.
				-Oh, this list is amazing: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#variant-familiars
				-Hummingbird, for +4 Initiative, definitely rivals cat.
			-Interesting applications with ships, especially flying ones.
				-How big can you make illusions? Big enough to hide a ship in a cloud?
					-1st level spell Silent Image is plenty big, with a duration of Concentration!
					-Ah, but can an illusion _follow_ a ship? Silent Image seems to have a static
					 location. _Maybe_ tortured logic would consider a ship a location. . .
						-Seems like it's not a settled question: https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/195428/can-the-permanent-image-spell-move-with-the-caster
						-Thus, probably a DM call.
			-Illusionist is a great fit for social rogue.
				-Lies + illusions = profit.
				-Invisibility + rogues = death.
				-Eventual Simulacrums are an amazing effect from a cohort: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/simulacrum.htm
	-What about followers?
		-Dread Pirate will double them at it's 10th level.
		-You'll have eight level ones if you take it right at 6th level, even without Charisma buffs.
		-See "Recruit more" for notes about air elemental followers.
		-Some kind of "air bike" concept seems attractive, small 1 or 2 man airships.
			-Perhaps alchemically armed? A swarm of these things hurling alchemist fire seems like
			 a major threat to airships.


TODONE:
	-Maybe get some arrows of other materials?
		-Definitely silver, given the Shapers.
	-Upgrade to a longbow. Marshal gave you the proficiency.
		-Composite Longbow (Str +1) for 200? Or a masterwork one for 500?
	-You pretty desperately need a Handy Haversack: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Handy_Haversack
    -Appraise "your" airship. You need something worth at least 10,000 gp. for Dread Pirate.
        -You rolled like shit, but it's at least 20k new, enough to become a Dread Pirate.
	-Get a masterwork buckler, to eliminate it's skill penalty.


TODON'T:
	-Tiger time? See TODOs before 6/1/22.
