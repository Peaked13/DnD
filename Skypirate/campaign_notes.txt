12/29/21:
	-We're members of a scouting party sent out by The Brotherhood.
		-We were furnished with an airship and sent out to explore The Material, seeking wonders,
		 knowledge, and resources.
		-Larix serves as our helmsman, capable of communicating with the bound air elementals that
		 power the ship.
			-The hull is Edric-built, sailing forth from one of his enormous factory cathedrals, but
			 the service of the elementals was purchased.
			-The "engines" require regular castings of a spell to keep running. A common service, it
			 runs about 50 gp. for our ship, and our engines currently have two weeks of runtime
			 left.
		-Your individual tasking probably resembled this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalndXdxriI
	-After days over the ocean, we came to a kind of port city, newer spires surmounting ancient
	 machinery, and docks below, on the shores of the island this all stands on.
		-Low on supplies, and with Larix assuring us this at least wasn't actively hostile territory,
		 we decided to dock.
		-The city's name proved to be Sasserine.
		-It had recently undergone some kind of change in leadership, "the guilds" having "abandoned
		 the city", with The Dawn Council taking it's place.
			-Indeed, we saw several on the street bearing a sun emblem, along other badges: a
			 lighthouse surrounded by a dragon, a sword with a shield and helmet, a tiger with a
			 rose, and a spider and keep.
		-The city seems to be mostly human.
		-Ruins were frequently in evidence, broken bridges and the like, that seemed to indicate the
		 city had been rebuilt several times.
	-In paying the docking fee, we also heard about a job opportunity, a lady offering work, and
	 requesting candidates meet her at her estate tomorrow evening.
	-In the meantime, we found a tavern, The Drunken Bear.
		-Talking with the barkeep, we learned more about Lavinia. Apparently she'd lost her family
		 in an airship accident, leaving just her and a sibling.
		-The barkeep also seemed none too fond of The Dawn Council, on account of new taxes.
		-She also told us of the city's seven districts:
			-The Champion District, with the arena and other entertainments.
			-The Merchant District, where we docked and were staying.
			-The Cudgel District.
			-The Sun District.
			-The Noble District.
			-The Azure District.
			-The Shadowshore, the one part of the city where the dawn can't reach. . .
		-We also rented a room there.
	-With time to kill, we also checked out the markets of The Merchant District, finding some
	 decent options for resupplying the ship.
	-Varani kept hiding his face when we passed those bearing the emblem of The Dawn Council.
		-I asked him what the deal was and he said someone he'd "rather not talk about" had paid
		 them to capture him.
	-We spent the night at The Drunken Bear.
		-During the early hours of the morning, Varani heard me mumbling in my sleep: "No! No more
		 ink blots. . ."
	-When we woke, Varani was gone.
		-Asking the barkeep, she left about two hours before I came down, and outside there was a
		 lot more Council activity. . .
		-Once Larix woke too, though, he consulted his hawk, who led us to a dead-end alley, and
		 Varani then descended from a hiding place atop some crates and beneath the eaves of a
		 building.
		-Apparently The Dawn Council is looking for her in force, hand she was unable to get back
		 to the bar after going for a run.
	-We decided to find a way to The Shadowshore, and lie low until our dinner tonight.
	-After some quick patches to an abandoned skiff, we took to the water, to cross the lagoon,
	 but opted instead to stop on a deserted, brush-and-trash-strewn island. It seemed a good 
	 hiding spot.
		-Not entirely deserted, as it turned out. I heard the sound of some voices speaking in
		 Goblin somewhere nearby.
		-I crept over and listened in. It seemed they were a party of scrappers, arguing over salvage.
		-Goblins seem generally _tolerated_, if looked down upon, so I decided we should leave them be.
		-There's bigger fish in the water tonight, and no sense showing up to a lady's house smelling
		 like we'd been rolling around in trash with goblins.
	-As the time came, we headed to our dinner.
		-After knocking, we were ushered inside.
		-A party of armored folks were exiting as we entered. Apparently Lady Lavinia has other
		 suitors. . .
			-Varani knew them as a group of mercenaries, "The Jade Ravens".
			-They were talking about being sent to the city of Cauldron, to the South.
		-As we spoke with Lady Lavinia, she spoke of money troubles, a vault beneath a castle, and
		 the two signet rings that can open the vault. Her father's is the only one available, but
		 it's aboard an impounded ship.
			-She paid the fine, but the man holding the ship claims to have never received it, and
			 she suspects he's up to something, aboard the ship.
				-Soller Vark is his name, and she suspects him of being a smuggler.
			-She asks that we recover her money, and, if possible, find out what he's doing aboard
			 the ship.
				-I haggled for 250 gp. in exchange for the task and she directed us to the ship.
	-Heading there, the ship proved not to be docked, but moored some distance out form the peer.
	-We opted to pretend to fish on our skiff, and keep an eye on ship until midnight at least.
		-No one came or went, and the deck was deserted save a sentry that came out from time to
		 time, but animal noises came from within the hold.
		-We tried climbing the anchor chain, but it. . . did not go well. I was able to play off the
		 noise as a drunk Varani falling while fishing, but we then had to row out of there as the
		 sentry shoed us off.
		-We opted to return another night.


1/12/22:
	-Returning to our own ship to spend the night, given the goons looking for Varani near the inn,
	 we debated our strategy.
	-We didn't come up with anything better, though, and Varani claims she's not normally that clumsy,
	 so we opted to keep watch over the ship for another day, and attempt boarding again after
	 nightfall if we don't catch someone leaving the ship.
	-A little while into the morning, we boarded our skiff and headed out onto the bay to watch the
	 ship.
		-Near nightfall, the ship headed in toward the dock it had been tied to, some distance out.
		-We followed, and as we neared the ship, we could hear them shouting about making the ship
		 ready for departure.
		-We beached the skiff and hurried towards the dock, Larix employing his shapechanger
		 heritage to disguise him as one of the crew.
			-Ducking behind a crate, he tried to hide to cast a spell, summoning a mist to give the
			 rest of us some cover.
			-He was caught in that, but his disguise worked, and he was shoed aboard the departing
			 ship.
		-Varani then tried playing it cool, carrying a random crate aboard, while I crouched behind
		 one still on the docks.
		-Didn't go too well, though. A sentry questioned her, and she then dropped the crate and ran
		 aboard.
		-Well, there's my distraction, so I attempted to sneak aboard myself.
		-Varani threw a punch at one of the thugs, and a brawl ensued.
		-Larix tried his spell again, calling up the mist, but at least one of the sentries began
		 pointing and shouting at him as he did so.
		-With the shit kicking off, I ran into the now-present fog, towards someone shouting from
		 the upper deck on one end of the ship.
			-Hmm. . . I may lie to the lady about what went down here. "Some fight with criminal
			 rivals, no doubt. . ."
		-Hearing some commotion nearby, I crept up on someone stomping around in the fog, only to
		 trip over a length of rope abandoned on deck. Someone began shouting at me to keep back,
		 so I stabbed into the fog with my rapier, but didn't connect with anything.
		-Things went pretty far South. After another vain fog-stabbing, and a legit me-stabbing, I
		 ran the fuck away, back onto the dock and ducking behind a crate..
		-These aren't good odds. I figured I might be able to buy some time, though, and set about
		 sabatoging the ramp running from ship to dock, wedging a stake found on the dock into the
		 rotating mechanism it was locked into. Now, as the ship moved with the waves, it squeals,
		 and probably won't be easily undone.
		-I then made my way towards the seaward end of the ship, where the anchor chain and the
		 docking rope were, aiming to sabatoge those too.
			-I had to take it slow, though, darting from cover to cover, having seen thugs
			 brandishing crossbows on the ship.
		-Meanwhile, the commotion in the fog seemed to intensify. There was some kind of metalic-
		 sounding shrieking, as if from something breaking, and then running and thuds.
		-I got to the anchor and, seeing the quick-release lever for it's winch, leaned over onto
		 the ship, and pulled it, dropping the anchor. I then darted back, further down the dock,
		 and behind some crates.
		-Now there were _screams_ coming from the ship, and someone yelling, "It's free! It's free!
		 Abandon ship!"
		-In short order, one of the sailors ran down the ramp and onto the dock. Another even lept
		 down from the poop deck, but landed badly and wasn't moving.
		-I sheathed my rapier and then ran up to the one by the ramp, shouting, "I heard the
		 commotion! What's going on here? Do you need help?"
			-He responded with jumbled, panicked shouting, saying something about "the fog" and "It's
			 loose!"
			 "What's loose?!?"
			 "Fuckin' spider thing!"
		-More crew fled the ship, and eventually the fog cleared, revealing Larix and a horrible
		 spider-thing, with waving. . . tendrils.
		-The monster didn't seem hostile towards Larix, though, exhibiting a kind of deference to
		 him as he spoke to it in a language I did not understand.
		-This chaos had caught the attention of a couple of guards, who were running towards the
		 monster (and visibly pissing it off).
		-I rushed to intervene, shouting, "Guards! These men have been smuggling monsters into the
		 city, aboard their hired ship! My friend has control over it for the moment, but you must
		 apprehend them!"
		-They seemed to buy it, and Larix tried to convince them to back off, that he had it under
		 control, but they instead shouted something about putting it out to sea, and tried to undo
		 the ramp (that I sabotaged).
		-That pissed the spider-thing right off, though, them approaching. Larix tried to calm it,
		 but to no avail, and it grabbed the guards with it's tendrils, shaking them to death.
		-It then looked over back at Larix, like a dog proud of the bird it caught as the limp
		 guards dangled from it's tendrils.
		-Larix asked that I help him get one of the ship's boats overboard. I lowerd it with it's
		 winch, and then he coaxed the beast overboard, and into it, rowing out into the bay.
			-While doing it, I asked him where Varani was, and he said he saw her breath her last.
		-Meanwhile, we saw some further off guards apprehend Soller, at least, and a few of his men.
		 With the boat in the water, I went over to tell our story.
			-As I approached, Soller was receiving some rough treatment. It seems he was known to
			 them, as one said to another, "This thug has been evading us f\\\\\\\\\\r a long time. He's off
			 to the dungeons."
				-Another also mentioned something about having aprehended about half of the men they
				 saw fleeing.
			-I volunteered that we were here as agents of the ship's owner, having heard unsavory
			 things about what was going on aboard. We were here to investigate, having boarded the
			 ship only to hear shouting and chaos from below, apparently their smuggled monster
			 getting loose.
				-They were willing to accept that, and to let us take control of the ship. I didn't
				 mention the owners name, but the guards did ask _my_ name. Too proud to do otherwise,
				 I told them Fredrick had this under control, and that I'd let the ships owner know
				 her property had been secured.
		-A short while later Larix returned, wounded, but saying the monster was now free and outside
		 of the city.
		-I let him know we'd met with great success. He agreed, stating he had the ring and a pouch
		 of coin too. The ring had a strange note tucked inside it.
		-With the ship secured, I searched it further, while he kept watch.
		-I then went in search of a runner, and paid him to go fetch Lady Lavinia.
		-A short while later, she indeed arrived, at the center of a party of hired guards.
			-One of those guards stood out, with spiked hair and wearing flowing robes.
				-We later learned his name was Forcas (Lesley's new character).
			-I called down to her, saying that we'd recovered the ring, fee, and boat all!
			-She was elated, though I also had to add that it was not without cost, as Varani did
			 not make it.
				-"We'll of course need to take her share to her family," I bluffed, to which the
				 lady agreed.
	-She had her guards take control of the ship, and asked us to join her in her hired carriage, 
	 where she spoke of further work, on retainer.
	-First, though, she wished us to come with her to her family's vault, in the city's fortress,
	 which the signet ring is key to.
		-To collect our pay, she said, though she also mentioned the vaults had some kind of
		 security, and that she'd like "seasoned adventurers" with her.
	-We traveled a mile or so across the city, and then took a ferry to the fortress's island.
		-It was a looming, forboding thing.
		-We unlocked her family vault, and it would see her fears were not unwarranted as some kind
		 of metallic cobra slithered out from the shadows within.
		-Forcas quickly lept at it, pummeling it with his fists and elbows.
		-I, meanwhile, stepped back, in front of the lady, and manifested my Force Screen.
		-We then took turns failing to harm it, while Larix summoned a wolf.
		-Larix eventually noticed it was lunging at everyone _but_ Lavinia. He pointed out as much,
		 suggesting it was another thing keyed to the ring.
		-She brandished the ring, and it soon backed off, slithering into some kind of hole.
		-Venturing into the next room, it was covered in various panels depicting different monsters
		 in threatening poses.
			-None matching the ones on the note, though. Hmm. . .
			-In the center, a piller stood, with a star emblem around it's top with one marked spike.
			 It was possible to rotate it, pointing the marked spike at the different images.
			-They _did_ each have a different number of eyes, though, I noticed. Once I pointed that
			 out, we turned the pillar to point to one eye, two eyes, etc., until, with the last,
			 the panels opened, revealing a vault behind each.
			-Most were empty of all but a few scattered coppers on the floor, but one contained
			 several still-full chests, and a bunch of paperwork.
			-We were paid out from that.
				-500 gp. to Larix and I (two shares each, due to Varani's share and Forcas's asceticism).


TODO:
	-(DONE) Level up to 2!
	-Write up the loot in some fashion.
		-Figure out the Fantasy Grounds party sheet inventory?
			-Varani's loot is in there.
		-(DONE) Or just do another spreadsheet?
			-Yeah, we decided to just to that, as only the DM seems to be able to do much with the
			 Party Sheet thing.
			-You and Joe recorded all cash already.
			-You created the spreadsheet and posted it. 
		-(DONE) You probably want to use some of that gear too.
			-Buckler?
			-Consumables?
			-Yep, both of the above. You put your name on stuff in the sheet, now update Roll20.


1/26/22:
	-As we left the vaults, Lavinia asked the clerk if anyone else had recently been in her family's
	 vault.
		-After checking his records, the clerk responded that one Vanthus Vanderborn had been inside
		 less than a month ago.
		-Lavinia reacted with surprise, saying, "My brother? He's been missing! He was her? Where did
		 he go?"
		 "We do not keep records of where our visitors go from here."
		-I started to ask about her brother but Lavinia said, "Not here. It's a long story, and
		 painful. . . Return with me in the coach, to my mansion, and we will discuss it further."
	-Back at the mansion, her gnomish servant greeted the lot of us, and also informed the lady that
	 she had a visitor, one Jade Shadowfeather (Shroud's artificer).
		-We each grabbed a drink, and then went to a sitting room, where Jade waited.
		-There, she told us the story of her brother.
			-Once extremely close, her brother has been missing for more than a month. Though
			 apparently he was close enough to empty the vaults. . .
			-The two of them had been separated for 5 years, after some youthful trouble, her sent
			 to a finishing school, and him to the family's country house.
			-Upon their return to the city, their rapport was gone, and he was behaving strangely.
				-He spent his days shut up in his room, only leaving at night, to go out into the
				 city, bringing back. . . disreputable men.
				-Eventually, he struck out on his own, leaving the family's home.
				-Some time after that, their parents' accident occurred. He returned for a bit, then,
				 but behaved worse and worse, eventually striking his sister, after which she cast
				 him out of the house.
	-She then raised the prospect of that further work: finding her brother, and bringing him back
	 to the mansion, to talk some sense into him.
		-Asking her what she knew of his whereabouts, she said he'd not been seen in the Noble
		 or Champion districts, where they have many friends, but that she'd heard he may have been
		 involved with a woman in the Azure district.
		-We agreed to aid her in this, and she, drinking heavily through the whole story, was soon
		 off to bed while we made our introductions to Jade.
	-I proposed we start with the mansion's servants. She'd said it they'd mentioned strange behavior
	 on his part, and maybe there's more to that then they wanted to tell his sister, the lady of the
	 house.
		-Talking with them, the reinforced the lady's narrative, and also mentioned many of his
		 companions sharing an odd tattoo, a hooded snake, though they didn't see the whole thing
		 on any of them, as it was invariably covered partly by clothes.
	-Larix then raised the matter of the hastily bandaged lacerations, and we asked after rooms in
	 the mansion for him to rest.
		-Jade remained with hime, while Forcas and I set out into the Azure district, to see what
		 the word on the street was, if anyone was talking about the snake-tattoo folks, or a noble
		 slumming it.
		-After a short bar crawl, we ran into a couple of folks who seemed to recognize our
		 description of Vanthus.
			-They all mentioned he'd been seen with Brisa Santos, a notorious pick pocket turned
			 artist. Neither had been seen in the district in most of a month, though.
			-We asked if they knew where she stayed, and one said, "Probably in those froofy artist
			 lofts that are popping up all over The Shadow Shore since the area started cleaning up."
		-So, that's the direction we headed.
			-There, Forcas spotted a couple of folks with the snake tattoos.
			-We saw one leaving a bar, and stepped inside, to ask about the man who wore it.
			-We learned from the bartender that the man, name unknown to him, was a regular, and
			 pissed that one Penkus, also a regular, owed him money, and hadn't been seen in some
			 time.
		-After I finished a strong ale, we headed back to the ferry, to worry about the rest of this
		 with the others in tow.
	-I took a moment after waking to talk Forcas into schlepping my junk about for me ("You look
	 strong. It's kind of even an act of charity!").
		-Good bye, encumbrance!
	-We headed back to The Shadow Shore the next morning, in search of Penkus, or at least someone
	 who knows who he owed money to.
		-We ran into a friend of Penkus in a restaurant nearby. He mentioned that he'd last seen
		 Penkus on a boat, a pleasure craft named It Still Floats, owned by a pessimistic dwarf
		 named Panchi. Penkus and Panchi had been arguing about something when this guy left for
		 the shore.
		-We stopped by Panchi's shop.
			-Apparently Penkus had rented It Still Floats, loaded it with lamp oil, lanterns, and
			 rope and then headed West.
			-Further, he was not alone, and had some "long haired, goateed noble" with him. . .
			-He requested that, if we see his ship, we send it his way, or at least salvage it's
			 enchanted propulsion.
	-We decided to take our ship to find that ship.
		-But first, we opted to stop by the Merchant district, to pick up some supplies for Jade to
		 craft me a rapier.
		-While in line at a stall, though, we noticed someone with a snake tattoo behind us in line.
			-I walked right up to him, asking him where he got the fancy tattoo, claiming I was, 
			 "Thinking of getting one myself, after seeing one on someone next to me in a Shadow
			 Shore bar."
			-Looking at it closer as I approached, though, it seemed. . . unfinished, or maybe fake.
			-He dodged that question, and instead launched into a pitch for some kind of party, if
			 we'd pay him the entrance fee.
				-Some kind of island art gallery experience shit, though, he eventually also
				 mentioned something about, "Smuggling the art back into the city. You'll be rich!"
				-What piqued my interest was his mention of the artist, Vanthus.
				-He also introduced himself as Chefton.
				-Well, I guess we're playing along with this harebrained scheme.
	-We boarded _his_ ship instead, and we sailed to a nearby island.
		-It had high cliffs surrounding it, save for a narrow beach.
		-After beaching the ship, he led us to a door in the cliff face, indicating that the
		 "exhibit" was inside.
		-He was reluctant to go in himself, but Forcas beat me to insisting, and he eventually
		 complied and led us inside.
		-Inside only a short while, though, the door was slammed behind us, with clearly-Vanthus
		 laughing and shouting from outside, "You actually fell for it?!? Did my sister send you?"
		-It was followed by the sound of rocks falling outside the door, which no longer budged.
		-Chefton, meanwhile, was shouting back, "You bastard! You trapped me in here with them!"
		-After some nicer-than-I-would have been questions from Forcas, Chefton said something
		 about these being old smuggling tunnels.
		-Well, fuck it, lets see where these go.
		-To half-flooded tunnels full of zombies, it turns out!
		-That. . . went poorly, and now Larix is dead from a thorough zombie gnawing.
		-Forcas was down too, but the bleeding had stopp, so Jade wracked her brain for stuff she
		 could throw together to heal him.
			-It took a couple of minutes and lots of improvising, but she managed to put together an
			 enchanted trinket that healed a few of his bites, getting him back on his feat.
		-I'd seen a fair amount of the tunnels, as I boldly scouted ahead for an escape route during
		 the fight. During that, we spotted a body in a pool of water.
			-We debated fishing it out, and it did have a fancy looking dagger strapped to it's belt.
			-There were some fierce looking crabs in the water, though, so we figured it would be
			 best to rest a bit before we risk provoking them.
			-Before resting, though, Jade wanted to try another healing trinket. However, as she was
			 assembling it and mumbling incantations, it exploded on her, and she went down, bleeding.
			-Well, shit. Forcas and I frantically tried to staunch the bleeding, and he was eventually
			 successful.
			-We dragged her back to the entry room, to hole up with Chefton while we rested a bit.
			-He was a despondent mess, unresponsive as Forcas called him over to help drag Jade, but
			 Forcas slapped him around until he helped.
			-We rested a while, and Jade eventually woke up.
			-I also eventually noticed a change in the sound of the lapping water, and I suspected
			 that low tide may have arrived, perhaps aiding in our escape from this place.


TODO:
	-Come back to that floating corpse.
	-Chat up Chefton, to Diplomacy-adjust his attitude towards us.


2/10/22:
	-As I did more looking into our predicament, examining the shaft by which we entered this place,
	 I felt a familiar presence, watching me. . .
	-I returned to the room where the rest of us rested, to alert the others to this, only for my
	 report to be interrupted by the miraculous appearance of a priest.
	-He introduced himself as Isaias, a follower of Shawn. Sounds like The Brotherhood thought we
	 needed rescuing.
		-I asked him if he could teleport us out of here, but he said no, it was a one-way trip.
		-I also said it sounds like someone doesn't like him, being teleported here just to be
		 trapped same as us, but he said it was his "chance to prove myself."
			-Me: "Tests, eh? I know all about tests. . ."
	-With him now with us, we returned to the room we fought those zombies in, to check on the water
	 there (and check the pockets of that floating corpse).
		-The water level had indeed dropped with the tide, but not so far as to leave any unflooded
		 opening.
			-Jade was weirdly willing to blindly swim an underwater tunnel, but I wisely suggested
			 we look through the rest of the place first.
		-I walked over to the pool, hoping I could snag the corpse with my bowstave, but a monstrous
		 crab emerged from the pool snapping at me, soon joined by several more.
		-I and the wounded Forcas got the hell out of there, retreating to the back of the room, but
		 the priest proved a real fanatic, and ran at them brandishing his weapon.
			-He soon had crabs hanging off him.
		-Crabs are apparently not confused by summersaults, but I can at least out run them. I tried
		 to kite one of the crabs, with mixed success.
		-In less than a minute, though, all the crabs were seafood, and none of us were pinched to
		 death!
	-Afterwards, Forcas immolated the human bodies in the room, "To give them a dignified end."
		-I asked if it was sacrilegious to also "immolate" the crab remains!
		-Turns out not, so we spent the next hour or so on a crab feast.
		-I even called Clifton over, and offered him some.
			-Chatting with him for a bit, he seemed to be warming up to us, but still despondent
			 about how he ended up down here, and not very hopeful about escape.
		-During this time, though, the pool of water began to rise again.
	-Following the feast, we examined the door to the West (shit, should have chosen the rhyming
	 East!).
		-Neither I nor the cleric of apparently unusual abilities noticed any traps, but he did
		 did say he heard through it the moaning of the damned-and-undead.
		-Well, despite our previous zombie disaster, with a priest by our side we felt a bit more
		 confident, and I boldy let Isaias go first.
		-That confidence in Isaias seemed well placed, as the zombies fled before the holy symbol
		 he brandished.
		-The passage they fled down was flooded not far past the door, though. It wasn't deep, but
		 it _was_ pulsing with the waves, and slippery, so it proved slow and treacherous going.
		-Too treacherous for Forcas, as it turned out. His repeated failures led to him nearly
		 drowning in a foot or two of water, with Jade and I stuck behind his flailing form in the
		 narrow corridor.
		-Yep, whole thing was a disaster. All of us fell a time or two, and are now resolved to
		 avoid that damned place until low tide again.
		-At least we managed to kill the zombies one by one, as they made their own way back out of
		 the surf towards us.
	-We opted to rest again, owing to the bruises all over Forcas and Isaias.
	-Eight or so hours later, we ventured out of our barricaded corridor.
	-It seemed now to be low tide, so we again braved the flooded corridor.
	-This time, it was a breeze, being mostly dry.
	-At the end of it, we found a room with the corpse of one Penkus, as identified by a vengeful
	 note clutched in his hand.
		-Apparently, Vanthus betrayed him too, trapping him here where he died a slow death from an
		 infected zombie bite.
		-It even told us where he makes his home, "in the lap o' th'Lotus, below th'Taxidermist's
		 Hall.
			-Penkus had a tatoo with a dragon twining around a flower, and the note seemed to

			 suggest that "the Lotus" is some kind of gang.
			-It also made reference to "the Lady of the Lotus" and Vanthus's "designs" on her.
		-Forcas even found a secret room, filled with genuine pirate treasure!
			-Various potions and other arcana, along with enough coins that we had to drag a sea
			 chest full of them with us.
	-Returning to the crab chamber, we checked the rest of it's doors.
		-Two led to closets, one of which had some useful scrolls at the bottom of some moldy old
		 supplies.
		-The third, though, was the series of rooms I'd previously run through, which we followed to
		 another door, leading away, rather than back to the entrance.
			-This one had the sound of more zombie groans coming from it, so we paused to prepare
			 (and for the end of the session.)


2/25/22:
	-We pawed through some of of loot, distributing useful items, before opening the door.
	-Suitably attired, we kicked in the door, revealing two zombies and some armored undead figure
	 who could manage complete sentences.
	-Isaias ran in, brandishing his holy symbol, but his god seems to have failed him as the zombies
	 were undeterred.
	-I had unwisely followed him down the hall, lunging at one of the zombies, only to miss.
	-When the zombie retaliated, swiping at me with his arm, I decided to make a strategic retreat.
	-Isaias was thankfully better with a dagger than a prayer, and between him and Forcas, one of the
	 zombies was soon looking rough (well, rough_er_).
	-It soon fell apart, and we moved onto the other undead creature, apparently a cleric from what
	 he was casting on his fellows in between harranguing us about "embracing death".
	-This one Isaias _did_ convince to flee with his holy symbol, prompting me to attempt to embed a
	 dagger in his back, but I missed as Forcas stuck a foot out and the cleric-creature went
	 sprawling.
	-Jade then finished him off with a crossbow.
	-Examining the cleric's holy symbol, Isaias deemed him a cleric of Olidammara.
		-I examined the symbol too, deeming it worth about 50 gp., for the weight of the gold.
	-The hallway ended in another pool of water, one Forcas was bold enough to wade into, looking
	 for another way out, and he emerged with some kind of shining orb!
		-Seems like it's somehow magical and, even better, likely valuable!
		-Isaias thought it might be tied to The Brotherhood.
		-Jade confirmed that, saying it's various divets were related to the keys to the various
		 planes of The Brotherhood.
	-A door off the halway led to a vile smelling room, containing a defiled alter.
		-Once dedicated to Olidammara, it was draped in dismembered corpses, perhaps a stage in the
		 cleric-zombie's conversion. . .
	-With that, we'd checked everywhere down here, and the flooded tunnel seemed our only bet for a
	 way out.
	-Well, I'm no swimmer, but _did_ have that Elixer of Swimming, so I chugged it while Forcas was
	 saying something about a rope.
		-After drinking it, I moved about in the water a bit, and seeing how I glided through it, I
		 volunteered to swim the tunnel trailing a rope in my hand, to aid the less elixed.
		-I got to the mouth of the tunnel, but caught myself on the spine of something in the coral
		 at the mouth. I could suddenly feel all that crab meat sitting poorly in my stomach, but
		 pushed through it, swimming up and breaching the surface of the water.
		-Around me, to my surprise, was Sasserine, I having emerged in one of it's rivers. An old
		 smuggling tunnel, perhaps.
		-I gave a tug on the rope, signalling the rest of the party to give it a shot, and Jade soon
		 emerged from the water too.
		-After that, though, the strands of red began to drift through the water. . .
		-I dove in, soon followed by Jade, to help what turned out to be a strugling Chefton,
		 bleeding from the coral.
			-We tried, along with some help from Isaias who followed Chefton down the tunnel, but
			 we were unable to drag him from the water.
			-Forcas eventually pushed him from the tunnel and swam up with him, but we were unable
			 to revive the poor bastard.
	-We were back in town at least. Probably don't want Vanthus or any of his gang realizing that,
	 though.
		-As such, we asked Isaias, who'd not been here when we left town, to go fetch some cloaks
		 to conceal us, and to find the nearest in.
			-Jade chimed in with a recommendation for the latter, saying there was actually one on
			 the nearby bridge.
		-We spent the meantime hiding beneath the bridge, hoping to stay out of sight.
		-While wringing out my bedroll though, I turned my back on Forcas and, when I turned back
		 around, he was gone.
			-Jade and I spotted him down the street, handing out coins to beggers. Fuck.
			-Well, _I'm_ staying out of sight, at least.
		-Isaias eventually returned with a set of too-nice-for-our-purposes cloaks.
			-He also came back with tales of the elven clothier offering some kind of "better
			 mithril", a kind of woven metal, that they were offering.
				-Light armor made from it would cost 1,500 gp. more than usual.
		-With his return, I _strongly_ suggested to Forcas that he perhaps sleep out on the street,
		 as he'd suggested instead of the inn, after all. People are bound to be following him after
		 that display. . .
			-He assented, arranging a time to meet us outside the inn.
		-Isaias then got he, Jade, and I rooms at the inn, which we entered cloaked.
	-After resting, we discussed our next course of action.
		-The three of us agreed that, well, Lavinia was paying us (some? all?), and had asked us to
		 report to her when her brother was found. Might as well do as she asked.
		-The estate was likely watched, though, so we again made Isaias our messenger (and ended the
		 session there).


3/9/22:
	-While we discussed our next move, a young elf unknown to us approached our table at the inn.
		-She remained silent for an awkward moment, looking us over.
		-Eventually, Jade asked, "Yes? Do you need something?"
		 "Yes. I think Lady Vanderborn sent me to find you.
		 "Oh?" I responded, "Did she tell you our names?"
		 "She did. She sent me in search of Forcas, Fredrick, Larix, and Jade, worried she'd not
		  heard from them in some time."
		 "Ah! Good to hear it! I'm Fredrick! Fred the Red, the call me."
		 "I'm Jade. Pleased to meet you."
		 "Forcas."
		-Well, that allays my suspicions somewhat, at least, since I don't think these Lotus jerks
		 ever heard our names.
		-She introduced herself as Kiani, and said she too was in Lady Lavinia's employ, sent at the
		 moment to check up on us.
		-We let her know we were waiting on an ally, sent as messenger to Lady Lavinia just moments
		 ago, and she asked if she could wait with us.
	-An hour or so later, Isaias returned, having met with Lady Lavinia.
		-He said she'd agreed her brother's crimes were dire, and gave us some amount of license to
		 deal with the matter ourselves, since the penalty the city's courts would likely hand down
		 would be death anyways.
		-He also said we might want to check on our ship, saying he'd heard the harbor master had
		 been killed, and that there'd been a "change of management".
			-In fact, Isaias also reported that law and order in the city appeared to be generally
			 breaking down, with criminal activity soaring.
	-Well, I, at least, am rather fond of that ship, and said as much. All agreed we should head
	 there quickly, though Isaias warned we should also come prepared, so we opted to unload our loot
	 and do some shopping.
		-At "The Tinker's Toolchest" we unloaded that junk, and perused some more, though nothing
		 really caught my eye.
	-We then headed down to the docks.
		-Along the way, someone sent us a very literal message, trying to tuck a note into Kiani's
		 pocket, though we caught the messenger.
		-No Lotus Dragon member, Kiani and Forcas gave him some gold in response to his sob story,
		 and also in exchange for information about where the message came from, describing a man
		 named Nemien at the taxidermist's guild.
		-As we approached the docks, we found them unusually empty, with almost no one out on the
		 street and the sounds of battle coming from somewhere above, amidst the airship docks.
		-It also sounded awfully windy up there, despite the day being otherwise calm.
		-As we approached closer, I could also hear words on the wind, in Auran: "Flee."
		-We speculated that a ship's air elemental may have gotten free, and pressed on, finding,
		 up top, several Lotus Dragon members in combat with some air elementals.
		-We joined that fun, picking off the busy gang members.
		-We made quick work of the gang members, with the last three surrendering to us.
		-When one of the air elementals turned and swung at Jade, I was able to convince them we
		 were friends, after the men they were fighting.
			-After the the remaining gang members surrendered, the surviving elemental and I spoke,
			 it telling a tale of escape from imprisonment in a crate, and it's desire to be free in
			 the air. We parted in peace.
		-The captives begged for their lives and freedom, which we demanded information in exchange
		 for it.
			-They were able to detail two entrances to the Lotus hideout: a trap door beneath a
			 chest in a backroom of the taxidermist guild and a passageway from beneath a pier.
		-With that info in hand, Forcas also insisted on one more concession: service. He insisted
		 that they join us aboard our ship, as sailors. Service to redeem them, and a way out of the
		 city where they're now in grave danger, after revealing their former comrades secrets.
	-We then headed to the taxidermist guild.
		-It was late by this point, and the front door was locked.
		-Looking below, for the entrance beneath the pier it sat on, we could see that the tide was
		 in, filling the area beneath with water.
		-Not confident of our swimming after the sea caves, I spent some time trying to pick the
		 front door, but a gang front uses an unsurprisingly good lock and I was unable to get the
		 door open.
	-We opted to return the ship, rest, and wait until the printed business hours.
		-During the night, though, we were woken by Forcas.
		-Apparently a relief party had arrived for the gang members we fought, and a disguised Isaias
		 had gone out to talk with them.
		-Isaias joined us a few moments later, saying he'd bought some time by telling them that
		 their comrades had gone in search of someone sneaking around the docks. He figured they'd
		 be back soon, though.
		-We set ourselves up in various locations, as an ambush.
			-We indeed managed to get the jump on them, routed them, and then picked them off as they
			 fled, to limit reporting back.


3/23/22:
	-We rested without any further gang members showing up.
	-The following morning, we debated how best to approach the gang's hideout.
	-With the tide lower this morning, we opted for the back door, and sent Isaias and Kiani to rent
	 a boat, their faces still being unknown to the gang.
	-They eventually returned to pick us up in a rented skiff.
	-There seemed to be lots of boats out on the water, and Kiani mentioned that some local fishing
	 contest was today.
		-Convenient, for our purposes. A good reason to be out on the water.
	-Rowing it over to the pier on which the taxidermy guildhall, we could see an iron gate closing
	 off a sea cave beneath it.
		-There was no mechanism for opening the gate from outside of it, though.
		-The bars are wide enough for someone to swim through, but that seemed like a bad idea even
		 before I spotted something shark-like swimming in the water on the other side of the gate.
		-Searching a while longer _did_ turn up some kind of keyhole in the gate, near the water
		 level, but fooling with it attracted the attention of one of the things swimming behind
		 the gate, which thrust a snapping maw up to the gate as I quickly pulled back my hand.
		-With it mere feet away on the othe side of the barrier, now, we figured we ought to take
		 some pot shots, though none hit.
		-That scared this one off, but several others rose, angry, in the water behind the gate,
		 chattering in some language unknown to us.
		-Uh oh. That might be the end of our surprise.
		-Jade named them Ixitxachitl, whatever the fuck that means.
	-Well, that door seems closed to us. Lets try the front.
		-We applied a few spells, and then strolled in the front door.
		-A man in the entryroom greeted us, introducing himself as Nemien.
		-I, in response, announced that we were famous hunters, in the area to do some hunting, and
		 looking to tour the facilities and see examples of the guild's work, to know who to bring
		 our business back to.
		-He agreed to the tour, and began leading us through the this reception area's interior door.
		-Stepping inside there, though, we heard another voice call out, from behind a door in the
		 next room, asking Nemien to come and speak with them, prompting Nemien to say the tour was
		 canceled after all, asking us to leave as he turned to go.
		-Forcas, with a frustrated expression on his face, announced that, "The time for talking is
		 over," and attempted to punch Nemien in the back of the head.
		-He stumbled while doing so, though, and the punch went wide.
		-Nemien, in response, cast a spell and disappeared, followed shortly by the door leading
		 further in opening and closing.
		-We rushed after him, and, as Forcas and Isaias burst through the door he'd passed through,
		 he revealed himself by casting another spell, to unknown effect.
		-Forcas, though, suddenly announced that, "What we're doing here is wrong." He then turned
		 to leave, pushing past us down the hall. . .
		-The rest of us were not so soft-hearted, though. I was still around the corner in the hall,
		 but I heard the thwang of Isaias's crossbow, and Nemien slumping to the floor.
		-I stepped past him as Isaias rifled through his pockets, but Forcas pushed him aside and
		 tried to staunch the flow of blood from Nemien's wound.
			-He seemed less like he's enscrolled, now, though, and more like he's being his self-
			 righteous self.
			-His medical skills weren't up to snuff, but he eventually resorted to pouring a potion
			 down Nemien's throat.
			-What followed, though, was reason enough to not consider Forcas _soft-hearted_ by any
			 means. Nemien woke up after the potion, but Forcas beat him halfway back to
			 unconsciousness while interrogating him.
			-He eventually revealed that there was a secret door in the hallway, leading to the 
			 gang's hideout.
			-Using a key on the ring Isaias took from Nemien, we got the door open while Forcas
			 slammed Nemien's head against a wall until he was unconscious.
	-Passing through the secret door and down a flight of stairs, we found ourselves in a dank
	 cave beneath the structure.
		-Some sentries greeted us through the first door with poisoned crossbow bolts, but we made
		 short work of them.
		-Moving past their corpses, we found ourselves in a maze of tunnels.
		-As we passed one door, we heard a gutteral voice within, complaining of lack of sleep.
			-Turning Isaias and Kiani, I asked, "Count of 3?" and then slowly pushed the door open.
			-Isaias and I each let fly with an arrow, while Kiani cartwheeled in between us, to stab
			 at the wolf-like beast within.
			-It was indeed the source of the voice. It grumbled more about just wanting a nap as it
			 snapped at Kiani's legs.
			-In short order, though, the beast lay bleeding out, with none of us having sustained
			 serious injuries.
		-From there, we followed the tunnels' various twists and turns, fighting the occasional
		 gangers, until we found the kitchen, where a cowering kobold cook pointed us in the
		 direction of Vanthus's room.
		-It proved well locked with a stout door, though, so we turned back to exploring the rest
		 of the tunnels.
		-We rescued a victim of torture, but Forcas was a jerk about the guy being reluctant to
		 discuss his undoubtedly shady business that ended up getting him extorted and eventually
		 tortured by the gang.
			-He shoved Kiani and we ended up beating him unconscious.
			-Forcas wouldn't let the matter of his line of work rest, though, and Kiani was now
			 pissed too.
			-They proceeded to torture the man, effectively waterboarding him.
			-In the course of that, he admitted he was actually a member of this gang, pretending
			 to be one of their victims. He was, in fact, the master of this torture chamber.
			-Well now I'm pissed at him too, since he's not an innocent smuggler or the like, but
			 rather one of the pricks that trapped us in that hole.
			-Forcas wanted to leave him unconscious but alive, to face eventual justice. However,
			 Isaias settled the argument by caving in his skull.
		-We never turned up the key to what's supposed to be Vanthus's room, so Isaias and I settled
		 in to very carefully attempt the lock we'd previously failed to pick.
			-Meanwhile, the others went off to examine a pool of water we previously passed by, and
			 returned a few minutes later with tales of a chained up crocodile.
			-Some 20 minutes later, Isaias and I finally got the lock open, and we entered the
			 room. . .


TODO:
	-(DONE!) Level up to 3.


4/20/22:
	-Over the course of opening the lock, we could hear. . . skittering, on the other side of the
	 door.
	-When the we got the lock open, I counted to three, threw the door open and ducked behind the
	 cover of the doorjamb and adjoining wall.
	-Forcas and Jade shot at something within as Isaias rushed forward, mace raised.
	-I drew my own bow and peeked around the doorway, seeing an enormous spider-thing, of the same
	 species those thugs on Lady Vanderborn's ship had been smuggling.
		-Not hesitating, I shot it right in one of its all too many eyes.
	-Another mace blow from Isaias and crossbow bolt from Jade solved the problem.
	-Isaias then rushed past it's still twitching corpse, chasing after some footsteps in the hall
	 beyond it.
	-I followed, finding Isaias battling a hulking goblinoid zombie. My arrow, though, shot over
	 Isaias's shoulder, didn't so much as slow it down.
	-While we fought the zombie, we heard a rasping voice shout. . . something, from behind a nearby
	 door. 
		-"We". I volunteered to "watch the rear".
	-The door then opened, revealing a reptilian humanoid who leaned forward and swiped at the zombie
	 with a clawed hand.
	-Soon, the zombie was down, and Isaias and Kiani were chatting with the creature.
		-"It wants to parley," Kiani reported.
		-"Does the wyrmtongue work?" I asked the creature.
		 "Yes. I can speak that too, but saw the elves among you."
	-The creature led us through a few more rooms and halls, to a meeting room in which stood a red
	 haired, jade eyed woman.
		-As we filtered into the room, she addressed us, saying, "Ah, _you're_ Lavinia's flunkies.
		 I'm Rowyn."
		-I responded first, saying, "I'm Fred, called The Red." The others followed with similar.
		-"What brings you to my aboad?"
		 "Well," I said, "You know our employer. Surely you know her brother?"
		 "Yes. . . he's a firebrand."
		-That elicited a snort from me.
		-"You've done some impressive work," she continued. "Work for me instead. With my connections
		 and your brass, we can take the whole city for ourselves."
		 "What of Vanthus?" I asked, "Won't he be jealous?"
		 "Jealous, yes. But he'll work with us nonetheless."
		 "Why would you work with someone like him?" Isaias asked.
		 "Isn't it obvious? He provides us with money, of course."
		-She then engaged in an increasingly shouty (on Forcas's part) moral debate with our monk.
			-She argued that obeying an unjust law was no crime, but he was characteristically
			 inflexible.
		-She quickly grew visibly tired of that and, eventually, interrupted Forcas saying, "Clearly
		 you don't know what's good for you. Gut Tugger? Get them!"
	-At that, the reptile thing promptly bit Jade's arm, while Rowyn broke into a song about a lucky
	 outlaw that they both seemed to enjoy.
		-I tried to shut her up, but my arrow struck the wall to her left.
		-Soon, the small chamber was filled with a wild melee.
		-Kiani seemed to recognize what this lizard thing is, and tried speaking further to it in
		 Elvish.
			-Not sure what she said, but it _did_ seem suddenly unsure of itself, taking a step back
			 from the fight.
		-Seeing that, Rowyn's singing faltered, and she instead grabbed a vial from her pocket,
		 downed it, and dissolved into a cloud of green smoke that began to drift towards the hall
		 we came through, moving towards a closed door next to Jade.
		-Forcas blasted her still gaseous self with a burst of luminous energy, also setting the door
		 behind her on fire.
		-That didn't stop her from slipping beneath it, though.
		-Meanwhile, Kiani, and now Isaias too, continued to talk with the lizard in elvish. It seemed
		 agitated, but was at least no longer trying to bite us.
		-Eventually, it handed Kiani a key, taking it from a cord around it's neck.
		-Forcas, Jade, and I raced after the gaseous Rowyn. Jade followed her to a door that turned
		 out to contain a bathchamber, but she'd apparently escaped through an air vent.
		-Returning to the meeting chamber, Gut Tugger was now rather cooperative, and had offered to
		 lead us to the gang's vault, which the aforementioned key opens.
		-He led us a bedroom, and showed us a keyhole concealed at the base of one of the walls.
			-While he was doing that, Kiani and I also rifled through the bedroom (Rowyn's?) fancy
			 perfumes, many of which were quite valueable.
			-We also found a journal, that seemed to belong to Vanthus Vanderborn. Reading through
			 it, he admitted to the murder of his parents, and discussed plans to commit a more ship
			 arson soon, which may be a clue to his whereabouts.
		-Kiani and Gut Tugger then got the hidden door open, though Gut Tugger held her back when
		 she tried to step inside, warning of a trap in the floor. He rushed in to open an empty
		 chest, saying it would disable the mechanism in the floor.
		-There were two more chests in the vault, which Gut Tugger said he did not have the keys to
		 them.
			-After the floor trap, we wanted to be cautious, and Isaias and I both carefully checked
			 the chests for more traps.
			-He claimed them clean, but I pointed out the trigger mechanism for a dart trap on each.
			-A comedy of errors then ensued, in which we both disabled a trap the hard way.
				-I was more confident of my skills and tried to disable the first one, only to get
				 a poison dart for my trouble.
				-Feeling queasy after that, I insisted Isaias take a turn. His luck was no better,
				 but _his_ dart was curteous enough to skip off his armor.
			-The traps at least sprung, Isaias and I took our time getting the locks open, but
			 eventually popped them.
				-One contained assorted loot, clearly from a variety of sources. Coins from many
				 nations, some filthy, some pristine.
				-The other, though, contains gems in bags labeled with the crest of House Vanderborn.
	-Gut Tugger, at least, we were rather happy with here. It and Kiani had a long conversation in
	 Elvish, and she reported that she would be arranging for him to take service with her parents.
	-We opted to rifle through the rest of the guildhall, to make sure we missed nothing more.
		-With Gut Tugger's help, we made short work of that, but there was little else of interest,
		 save four more of the spider monsters, in cages.
		-I thought they might be valuable to the right buyer, but didn't know where to find one and
		 wasn't about to set them free, so we left them.
	-Leaving the guildhall, we headed back to Lady Lavinia's estate.
		-Her housekeeper woke her while we waited.
		-When she joined us, I warned her she might want to sit down for this one and handed her the
		 journal.
		-Jade also brought up the matter of the gems marked with her family crest, eliciting a scowl
		 from me, and Isaias turned them over to her.
		-She was understandbly agrieved to learn her brother was responsible for the deaths of her
		 parents.
		-Her gnome housekeeper comforted her, while Isaias and Forcas both ranted about "the will of
		 the gods", the former aiming to comfort, while the latter shouted about their demand for
		 retribution here, probably canceling out the former.
		-She eventually thanked us for the return of her family's funds, giving us each a bonus of
		 a thousand gp. worth of the gems.
		-She also said that she would inform The Dawn Council about her brother's activities, and
		 of The Lotus Dragons' disarray.
		-Then, Lady Lavinia offered up her estate to us, to rest and recover from our wounds. We
		 spent several days there, recuperating.
	-Over the course of our rest, the council indeed investigated The Lotus Dragons' hideout, and
	 cracked down on them heavily.
	-Jade also took some time to try and track down the kobold that helped us. She thinks she found
	 work as a cook on a ship, but wasn't able to find her to actually speak with her.
	-Finally, towards the end of our week of rest, we received an invitation from The Dawn Council,
	 to a dinner in our honor at The Scarlet Embassy, and place the council maintains for such
	 functions.


TODO:
	-(DONE!) Blank the loot sheet before next session, once everyone has written stuff they claimed down.
	-(DONE!) Shopping! You've got a bit over 5k.
		-4k on Gloves of Dexterity would be a pretty obvious one for you: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gloves_of_Dexterity
			-Yep, and sounds like they're available at list price.
			-Added them to your sheet.


5/4/22
	-A bit of poking at your glamoured chain shirt proved it can indeed replicate any non-magical
	 clothing, including a noble or royal outfit (on your torso, at least). Ready for the ball!
	-I also got drunk with Kiani's lizard pet.
		-Apparently he hadn't tasted wine in a century.
		-Also apparently, he can drink like a champ.
		-We made a wild night of it, starting at the Vanderborn estate, and continuing on at a
		 tavern a dwarf with a four color beard recommended. Though I think he was just trying to
		 get with the bartender, the music was still good.
			-It's called "The Lusty Leper". Or maybe "The Lusty Leopard"? The dwarf's clarification,
			 "The one with the spots," didn't help much. . .
		-We drank with alchemists, Kiani got Gut Tugger a job as the bar's official party lizard,
		 and I name dropped our way out of guards wanting to shut things down due to a noise complaint.
	-Forcas, Isaias, and Jade eventually joined us at the bar, with Forcas saying something about
	 another event that needed livening up.
		-"Oh? Who died?"
		 "This dwarf's brother."
		 ". . . awkward choice of words on my part."
		-Still, I did my best to liven up a funeral, one which helpfully consisted of throwing the
		 deceased possessions into the sea (along with whatever else the drunk crowd following me
		 grabbed along the way).
		-Much drinking and littering ensued.
		-By the end of Isaias's sermon, I was getting more maudlin drunk, and announced, "Everyone I
		 grew up with is gone. . . Not dead, but gone all the same. . ." I followed that by throwing
		 my now empty road beer bottle into the sea.
		 "Yeah, didn't you lose the rest of your original party?" Isaias asked.
		 "Oh yeah, those guys died too. Get me another bottle!"
	-We eventually returned to the Vanderborn estate, a short while before dawn, and I awoke very
	 hung over, the following afternoon.
		-After talking the kitchen into making me a late breakfast of some eggs, Lady Vanderborn
		 also walked us through the expectations and protocols of The Dawn Council ceremony this
		 evening. It earned us each a free rank in Knowledge (Nobility & Royalty).
			-"There are _drinks_ at the party, right?"
			 "Of course," Lady Vanderborn replied, "Though there'll be more of that in afterparties
			 at the estates of various nobles. None here, likely, though, given the impact of
			 Vanthus's actions on our family's reputation."
		-The servents at the estate also bathed a reluctant Forcas at our urging. He cleans up OK,
		 but looked distinctly unhappy about the whole affair.
	-That evening, we all loaded into Lady Vanderborn's carriage, and headed to the party in our
	 honor.
		-It took us a bit to reach the front of a line of carriages winding through The Noble
		 District, but, once at the event, the guards ushered us inside.
		-Just inside the door, we were met by a man in garments emblazoned with a sunburst.
		-He introduced himself as Xavius, the leader of The Dawn Council, and we each introduced
		 ourselves to him in turn.
		-We were then introduced to a variety of wealthy and powerful folks, their faces and names
		 soon a blur.
			-Among them were:
			 Quim - Wine, Thoreous - Waste disposal,  Otso - Woodworker's Guild, Nizol - Fishmonger,
			 Dranthus - Miner's Guild
		-I eventually made a very successful speech, during which Isaias took the opportunity of to
		 cast some kind of spell (he'd requested a distraction from me).
		-In small chit chat thereafter, I did hear rumors of possible work.
			-One man mention that the Miner's Guild was always looking for muscle, and another, one
			 of the nobility, even mentioned he'd love to hire me as the family's envoy.
				-"Well, I am a hit at parties!"
		-Forcas seemed to get angrier and angrier throughout the party, and eventually began
		 scornfully ranting about "the decadence of these so-called nobles."
			-Several of us bluffed our way through calming that situation:
			 "Forcas, your impression is dead on! Isn't he a hoot?"
			-Situation defused.
		-We also met one Maya Dracus, who seemed quite fascinated by us.
			-She was a scion of one of the city's noble houses.
			-House Dracus was an old one, but one which had recently required some ill repute.
			-Oddly, she also asked us about The Morticians' Guild.
				-Ugh. Not a crowd I want anything to do with.
		-A priest of Tyr also really wanted us to come to a service.
			-Pass.
			-He and Forcas started arguing theology.
		-Finally, it was time for the ceremony itself and, after some speechifying by Xavius, we
		 were given medals marked with the spire of Sasserine, designating us honorary delegates of
		 The Dawn Council.
			-It gives +2 circumstance to Diplomacy and Gather Information in Sasserine, but that
			 overlaps with me Marshal bonus, so only really useful for the others, and only when I'm
			 not around.
	-Afterwards, it was afterparty time!
		-After some amount of badgering from me, we led a trail of minor nobility and assorted
		 hangers-on back to Lady Lavinia's estate.
		-Partying ensued.
		-I danced with Lady Lavinia.
		-We also heard more from Maya Dracus, who had followed us to the after party.
			-She wanted to talk more about The Morticians' Guild, claiming there'd been all too few
			 funerals lately. She believed that the bodies were instead being used in dark rituals
			 of some form.
			-She also mentioned that there was a brisk trade in dragon bones lately, which she
			 thought may be ending up in similar rituals.
			-Finally, and the carrot to all this, she thinks they might have had dealings with The
			 Lotus Dragons, and that Vanthus could be hiding with them.
				-_That_ caught my attention. Still want to stab that prick.
	-We were amenable to Maya's deal, her assistance in finding Vanthus in exchange for ours in
	 finding out what's going on with The Guild.
		-We'll start that investigation next session.


5/18/22:
	-We debated how to go about investigating these corrupt cadaver cosmeticians.
		-My idea to drink until someone passes out, and then pass them off as a corpse yielded
		 stares, rather than the expected standing ovation.
		-Maya wasn't willing to disclose her source for these rumors of corruption, but says she
		 trusts them.
			-"Hush-hush then. I see."
	-We decided to disguise Jade as a corpse.
		-I wasn't too sure of the plan here, but it seemed like fun, and Jade was willing. Why
		 the hell not?
		-Did the make up, and did a pretty decent job of it, if I do say so myself.
		-To complete the job, we went to see an alchemist.
			-"Say there, shopkeep, got a potion with which I could fake my own death?"
			 "Why would you want that?"
			 ". . . a surprise party."
			 "That'll be quite the suprise. . ."
			 "Yeah. I can't wait to see the look on Mom's face."
		-We got something that should convincingly paralyze Jade for an hour, an inky black potion.
	-In the course of that, I got a message from Forcas, who'd been watching outside The Morticians'
	 Guild.
		-Apparently people just deliver notes to the guild, indicating where the body is to be found.
		-However, no one seems to leave the guild, not while Forcas was there, and not in days, from
		 what the people he asked said.
		-In return for the delivered message, I bought the urchin that brought it lunch in the nearest
		 tavern.
		-I spent the next three hours there, eating and drinking, but eventually went to find Forcas.
	-On the way to see Forcas, we spotted a 3 ft. long rat in an alley we passed, though it skittered
	 off when we saw it looking at us.
		-Maya said such things aren't exactly indigenous to the city, but that a gang known as The
		 Shapers is rumored to have were-rats among them.
	-When we got to The Morticians' Guild, Forcas was nowhere to be seen.
		-We asked some likely looking homeless men (his crowd) if they'd seen him, and we were told
		 that he had descended into some kind of catacombs.
		-Waiting around an hour or so, Forcas and the man who apparently led him down there, one
		 Josias, came walking back over.
		-Forcas sent Josias off, and then bade us follow him.
			-He asked me for some booze as he went. I shrugged and handed him my half drank road beer.
		-As we walked, Forcas talked.
			-Josias was a apparently once a member of the guild, but it had turned dark after some
			 kind of scaled humanoids started hanging around. An ogre corpse was stolen, and many
			 members were driven off.
				-Their scales apparently came in varied colors, red, white or black. That, to Maya,
				 perhaps said Tiamat and her cult, a god the Bahamut-following noblewoman was none
				 too fond of.
			-Josias also told him how the guild moves around: through the city's catacombs.
				-Apparently there's a locked iron grate leading to the guild down there.
			-While walking, Jade also thought she saw something. . . whiskered, watching us from a
			 rooftop above.
				-She called our attention to it, and Forcas flared bright, but there was nothing up
				 there when we all looked.
		-Forcas led us into the catacombs through a nearby tunnel entrance, it's door wrenched open
		 long ago.
			-Inside, a short distance from the entrance, was the door Forcas had described.
			-I got out my lock picks, but Maya pulled me back, saying she saw a magical aura on the
			 door.
			-After examining it, Jade said it looked like a casting of Arcane Lock.
			-Best we could come up with was buying a scroll of Knock, which Isaias and I went off in
			 search of while the others opted to loiter in a catacomb.
			-With this damned rat-thing lurking about, we opted to move quietly.
			-It was late, but a creepy novelty shop was still opened, and a man with obviously fake
			 vampire teeth got us sorted.
			-Returning in a similarly stealthy fashion, we came upon a melee back at the catacomb
			 entrance.
				-The others were fighting a pair of were-rats and a were-tiger!
				-They were faring poorly, wounds dripping blood, though the tiger was wounded as
				 well.
				-Isaias and I each took careful aim and shot at the tiger, but the arrows soon
				 embedded in him barely seemed to slow him, though it got one of his rat buddies
				 shooting me as I ducked behind a barrel.
				-Two more swipes from the tiger and suddenly Forcas and Maya were on the ground and
				 out of my sight.
				-I tried to kill the were-tiger with my brain and met with some success, but he
				 proved hard headed, and was soon running my way.
				-He managed to catch me, leaping down from a rooftop to give me a nasty scratch,
				 one the soon had me feeling queasy.
				-Fortunately, Forcas began bellowing insults at the beast and I summersaulted back,
				 ducking, turned a corner down an alley, and hid again behind a barrel.
					-Someone must have gotten him back on his feet, and not a moment too soon!
				-The tiger-man ran down the alley past me, thankfully not noticing me (and I was not
				 keen to remind him with an attack of opportunity), and engaged Forcas in melee.
				-I ducked from cover to cover, loosing arrows at the beast, while others joined
				 Forcas in the fray.
				-Sadly, though, Forcas soon lay unmoving at the monster's feet, after a particular
				 grevious swipe nearly severed his arm at the shoulder.
				-Someone out of my sight threw a dagger at the tiger's face and it staggered away
				 from the melee, trying to pull the dagger from it's eye while I loosed another
				 arrow at it and Isaias gave chase.
				-Isaias chased it down a cross street, and I then heard a great thud.
				-I cautiously crept forward, and, rounding the corner, was disappointed to see a 
				 bare-chested _man_ in the torn pants that once wrapped the tiger-beast.
					-Aww. I was was hoping for a rug. . .
				-Oh! I then ran over to check on Forcas, as Isaias called after me, saying, "I saw
				 the light leave his eyes, Fred. . ."
					-As I pulled my hands from Forcas's pockets, I said to our sad and wounded
					 group, ". . . I think I'll miss Forcas most of all, out of my various lost
					 comrades. *sniff* The other's left me so much more to remember them by. . .
					 Well! At least he'll aid us once more even in death: we now have a good reason
					 to talk to The Morticians' Guild!"


TODO:
	-I, and a couple of others, may be cursed. We should probably look into that.
		-Or just embrace being a weretiger?
			-https://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/lycanthrope.htm
			-Shit. It would be a sudden and very different direction for the character, but not that
			 bad. . .
				-+2 LA and 6 racial HD, but the latter are much better than usual due to Phrenic.
					-Reducing LA would come into play when you're level 12: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/races/reducingLevelAdjustments.htm
					-What are the racial HD?
						-Animal? https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#animalType
							-Yeah, "Lycanthropes As Characters" confirms as much.
						-Skills:
							-Skill points: 6*(2+3+1) = 36
							-Class skills: Balance, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, Swim
								-+6 Hide, +6 Move Silently, +2 (4 pts.) Perform (dance), Social?
							-That is pretty crippling, unless you want to just go into being a melee
							 rogue.
				-Would probably mean no Dread Pirate, but Shadowdancer could be your next class level.
					-Next levels:
						10	Shadowdancer 1
						11	Shadowdancer 2
						12	Rogue 3
					-Still, you'd have an underpowered sneak attack and only 3 attacks in a charge,
					 since Rake kicks in the _next_ turn (4 claws on that following turn).
				-Would mean no leadership until late, due to 6 _class_ levels required, and a poor
				 cohort when you get it.
				-Ah, no pounce, grab, or rake in hybrid form.
					-Maybe not a good idea, unless you can be a talking tiger.
			-Would have a weird impact on the game, since you'd suddenly have 9 HD, as well as a +2 LA.
			-It actually makes a lot of flavor-sense. Fred's bitterness over not getting to be an
			 Elan, his conviction he's already a better-than-normal freak, etc.
			-Hmm. . . can always become a tiger _later_. . .
	-Forcas's body?
		-Forment a riot against the Shaper gang that killed him?
			-Real Mark Antony vibes. . .
			-Make a martyred saint of him. They actually attacked him _while he prayed_.
		-Use it for Morticians' Guild shenanigans?
		-Both?


6/1/22:
	-Isaias is apparently well versed in medicine, and explain to us what those of us feeling
	 feverish likely caught: lycanthropy.
		-He explained that the easiest way to deal with it will likely to very quickly obtain some
		 wolfsbane.
		-Maya knew an apothecary that could likely help, The Wildwood Apothecary, over by the arena.
	-There was also the matter of Forcas's body. . .
		-I've got plans for it. . . funeral plans. So we need to hang onto that.
		-Maya mentioned a temple to Wee Jas that the moritician's guild had supplanted, and I also
		 threw out the idea of paying some of the street people to hide it for us.
	-Maya went to go arrange passage on boat, recognizing the house symbol marking one nearby.
		-She made some kind of arrangement with them, trading our eventual help with some problem
		 impacting the harbor.
	-With that set, we then took Forcas to his nearby soup kitchen.
		-They were a bit skeptical of hosting the body in an eatery, but we convinced them.
		-They were suitably agrieved by his loss.
	-That matter settled, we boarded the boat, and made our way towards the arena district.
	-There was some trouble with an overly officious guard at the gate of the district, but Maya
	 sorted that with in typical noble fashion, something that boiled down to, "Do you know who I
	 am?"
	-We found the apothecary and, with both some coin and help looking, we eventually found some
	 wolf's bane in the proprietor's overcrowded storeroom.
		-She also questioned us about why we needed such a thing and we recounted our run in with
		 the Shaper gang.
		-She was familiar with them, and even lamented their take over of some scrublands near the
		 old observatory. She used to gather herbs there, but they now let no one near.
	-We then debated what to do about the late Forcas.
		-Maya thought that, in light of Forcas (and several of the rest of us) having been recently
		 named a "Hero of the City", she could persuade the city's government to facilitate a grand
		 funeral.
	-We were pretty beat up, though, from the tiger fight, and opted to find rest first.
		-We returned to the Vanderborn estate, to rest there.
		-Lady Vanderborn was suitable aggrieved to learn of Forcas's death, and seemed to be
		 developing some doubts about this whole adventurers enterprise, but she also furnish us
		 with some healing potions, to see to our wounds.
	-We returned the following day to the soup kitchen, to see to Forcas's body.
		-It was crowded, and several of my companions stepped in to help distribute food.
		-Standing over the body, though, was a strange looking figure. Emaciated, and dressed in
		 rustic clothing, we asked him if he knew Forcas.
		-"As an easy meal, no more. He was a good person, though, and could have helped the city
		 much."
		-He introduced himself as "Nkondi the Hunter", and he seemed to know much about The
		 Morticians' Guild, saying they had "abandoned the teachings of the founder" and that "they
		 collect the dead for no holy purpose, but for their own purposes".
		-He also had a disturbing habit of talking to his "ancestors".
		-Isaias asked him if he was a follower of Nkisi, a name Nkondi seemed to know. He responded
		 that he was indeed "named for one of the ancestors".
		-There was then a commotion at the door. Robed figures had entered, announcing, "We have
		 come for the body."
		-Maya told them off, but they said they'd return soon.
			-Nkondi claimed they would come with reinforcements.
		-We decided to get Forcas out of there.
	-At Isaias's prompting, we took him to a temple of Shawn, near the arena.
		-We hired a chatty coachman, Havy, who thankfully bought the story that Forcas was drunk.
		-As we pulled up outside the cathedral, I stared a bit at the carvings on the outside while
		 Maya paid the coachman.
			-"Isaias, who did you say this was a temple to again?"
			 "To Shawn, of The Brotherhood."
			 "Ahhh. Um, I might sit this next bit out, go see what's going on at the arena. Meet me
			  over there?"
			 "Uh, sure?"
			 "Great! I'll save you all some seats!"
	-I wandered over to the arena, grabbed a beer, and found a seat in the stands.
		-The weather was good, the beer cheap, and the fights, if a bit uninventive, were decent 
		 entertainment.
		-As a watched, I caught a strange looking stranger eying me.
			-He had a green-ish cast to his skin, and fingers far longer than most humanoids.
		-Being a friendly sort, I raised my mug to him, in toast.
		-In response, he said, "Your mind. . . it is not normal, is it?"
		 "Eh, what's normal? I do like to think of myself as rather sharp, though."
		 "I mean that you have the mark of oppression on you. I have felt similar, for my people
		  were once enslaved by the mindflayers."
		 "Ah, I know what you mean. The one who. . . made me even has friends in this city. It's
		  why I'm here, avoiding them."
		 "I'm here because I would see these barbaric fights stopped. They remind me all too much
		  of the. . . entertainments that my people were once forced to participate in."
		 "I see, I see. Well, best of luck to you in that endeavor!"
		 "And to you in yours. I am called Gith. What is your name?"
		 "Fredrick, called Fred the Red."
		 "Well met, Fred. I will leave you to the. . . games."
	-I was eventually collected by the rest of the party, and we discussed what to do next.
		-They're amenable to my goal of riling up the people against the Shaper Gang, so we went
		 with Maya to talk with the city's government about a state funeral.
		-Lady Vanderborn's letters had already kicked off the process of gathering a quorum of The
		 Dawn Council, and they'd nearly all gathered already by the time that we arrived.
		-They were amenable to providing Forcas a hero's funeral, one lasting from dawn to dusk as
		 is the custom.
		-I asked if there would be an opportunity for me to speak, a eulogy, and they said I could
		 do so in the evening, in front of the court house.
	-We then retired to the Vanderborn estate, all save Nkondi, who stood watch over Forcas's body
	 at the temple.
		-Before we made it to bed, though, a cleric of Shawn arrived at the estate, out of breath,
		 reporting another attempt by The Morticians' Guild to claim the body, though they were
		 still dissuaded with words alone.
		-We returned with him to the temple, and opted to sleep there that night, in case they
		 return.
		-The next morning, I went out for both some breakfast and some rumors, curious about what
		 The Morticians' Guild might attempt.
			-Jade joined me in that, and we came back with reports of one of their robed figures
			 lugging around a large sack, from which emerged a wing (?).
			-Maya _had_ said something about suspecting the guid of trying to raise undead dragons. . .
		-When we came back with that, Maya suggested a potential shield, human and reputational.
		-We arranged a short notice wake/party before the temple, gather all we could with free
		 food and booze plus Maya's connections among the nobles.
			-Quite a crowd gathered and we regaled them with mostly true stories of Forcas's life.
			-It was quite the party, but it did not dissuade those killjoys in The Morticians' Guild.
			-The first sign of that was Jade shouting, "Look!" and pointing at the sky.
			-Circling above, there was indeed a winged shape that, as is swooped down, resolved into
			 a large, undead dragon. What scales it retained were white.
			-We did fierce battle with the creature. It could have gone either way but, after a few
			 moments, a cleric ran out of the nearby temple shouting that help was one the way.
			-The beast then lept into the air, and fled.


TODO:
	-(Done!) Level up!


6/29/22:
	-The beast driven off, the clerics of the temple rushed over to us, tending to our wounds.
	-They asked us if we knew who had attacked the wake, and I leveled the charge at The Morticians'
	 Guild, based on the rumored sack of winged thing Jade and I had heard they were hauling around
	 the streets earlier.
	-We still had three hours still until the official funeral was scheduled, so I figured I'd do
	 what I could to encourage people to return to the wake, and eventually join us for the procession.
		-I reassured those still hiding in the area that the dragon was gone, and encouraged them to
		 return, "To show those corpse-humping necromancers that you're not afraid!"
		-I then turned to the nearby taverns, to rally still more.
		-When I had returned to the temple-front wake, I found that Maya was gone. The others said
		 she'd been called away by a messenger from her family.
	-Eventually, it came time for the processional. A wagon drawn by fine white horses and bedecked
	 in flowers in the shape of an angel came to collect Forcas's body.
	-We and the crowd at the wake followed it, in a raucous mob, gathering still more people as we
	 walked.
	-Eventually, we arrived at the formal headquarters of The Dawn Council and the funeral began,
	 with Forcas lying in state.
		-It opened with a lengthy set of speeches by The Dawn Council's various politicians and
		 noteables, each transparently seeking to use Forcas to promote their own various agendas.
		-Nkondi and I spend much of that time riling up whatever portion of the crowd was in earshot
		 of us, calling for action and disparaging the timid investigations and panels a few of the
		 speaking council members made.
		-Finally, it came time for my speech.
			-I first spoke of Forcas's love for the city and it's people, saying how much it would
			 have meant to have this crowd here, and exhorting them to drag to the funeral any who
			 aren't already.
			-I then spoke of how Forcas died. How, while serving the people of this city, while
			 kneeling in _prayer_ on Sasserine's streets, he was cut down by a monstrous beast
			 dwelling among them. "Will you let this stand?" I asked.
			-At this point, a member of the council started trying to stop me, calling for the
			 guards to get me out of there, and saying it was time for his speech.
				-Isaias intervened, though, standing between us and talking to him, buying me time.
			-While that was going on, I stared at something in my hands for a moment, eventually
			 lifting it to show the crowd the bloody rag Forcas had been wearing when he was cut
			 down.
				-"This rag is what Forcas wore when the beast slew him! How," I shouted, throwing
				 the bloody rag into the crown, "Are you going to answer the spilled blood of a
				 saint?!?"
				-The crowd drew back as it fell, then rushed forward, staring reverently at it on
				 the ground.
				-Nkondi eventually collected it, affixing it to a pole as a makeshift standard.
			-I then began rallying them against The Shapers and The Morticians' Guild, speaking of
			 "the vile, twisted beasts, this Shaper gang, living among you" and "the foul corruption
			 of their corpse-stealing allies in The Morticians' Guild". As more and more improvised
			 clubs and torches began to appear, I told them, "We need to drive out this corruption,
			 with Forcas's holy, cleansing light!"
	-We then set the cart bearing Forcas's body alight ("They won't get _this_ body!") and,
	 with it in tow and Nkondi holding our bloody standard aloft, we lead the crowd towards
	 the nearest Morticians' guildhouse.
		-The door was elaborately locked, but that's no barrier to a mob. "Find a ram!" I called out.
		-Nkondi guided a group to a nearby statue that was toppled to serve the purpose.
		-As the were bringing it up, though, the zombie dragon returned, alighting on the roof of
		 The Morticians' Guild and roaring, scattering much of the crowd.
		-The beast wasted no time spraying my fellows with it's freezing breath, but I was
		 fortunately quicker, and already hiding behind a statue after taking a running pot shot at
		 it with my wand.
		-I continued sniping the beast while my comrades engaged in melee.
		-It knocked Isaias to the ground where he lay unmoving, but a blow from Jade felled the
		 creature.
	-While Jade saw to Isaias's wounds, getting him back on his feet, I ran off in search of the
	 scattered crowd.
		-"The dragon is gone!" I told them. "Can there be any doubt now that it was The Morticians
		 who attacked Forcas's wake?!? The very same beast guards their guildhouse! Show them
		 Forcas's light! Bring those torches!"
	-By the time I returned with a mob at my back, Isaias was back up, blade in hand, and the door to
	 the guildhouse was open. Jade was talking with someone in the darkness within.
	-She turned and began to say something to the rest of the party, but I was busy shouting
	 incitements at the mob.
	-The crowd was soon surging forward, setting the outside of the building alight as they threw
	 rocks and jars of lamp oil through the building's windows.
	-The guildhouse was soon a towering inferno, and the mob was looking for more targets.
	-Nkondi raised the matter of the catacombs, the ones we'd been investigating when Forcas died,
	 and we led the mob, bearing the statue-ram, to that door.
		-The door was fortified with spells, and the ram did no real damage to it, but we still had
		 the Knock scroll we'd purchased for just this.
		-I encouraged the crowd to step back and called Jade forward. "How are you with scrolls? I
		 can't read this shit but can probably make this work. Seems more like your kind of thing,
		 though."
		-She was confident of her skills, took the scroll, and soon had the door open.
		-We and the mob then streamed inside, with me shouting, "Come! Bring the light of Forcas to
		 these tunnels, and drive these necromancers from their holes!"
		-We found ourselves in a series of catacombs, as expected, with many of the tombs apparently
		 having been ransacked.
		-Surging forward with the crowd, we were met in an interior chamber by a booming voice, an
		 ogre shouting, "Come at me!"
		-Rather than oblige him, I stared him down, _really_ hard, manifesting Mind Thrust, and he
		 reeled, clutching his head. I immediately ducked behind some handy cover, hiding in the
		 shadows there.
		-Isaias rushed forward to engage the ogre, as some robed figures rushed up to it's aid, from
		 behind the creature, casting spells upon it.
		-Jade joined in the attack as well, with her bow, while Nkondi cast spells.
		-I leaned out of my cover, taking careful aim with my bow, and shot one of the robed
		 necromancers _right in her fucking face_.
		-Unfortunately the ogre evened the score by smashing Isaias into the ground with it's club,
		 leaving him an unmoving tangle of broken limbs.
		-Compounding matters, one of the necromancers began chanting and waving, and I soon felt a
		 great weariness coming over me. I powered through it by force of (psionically enhanced)
		 will, but Jade fell to the ground beside me, snoring.
		-The mob, at Nkondi's urging, began to pelt the ogre with improvised incendiaries. Soon, it
		 and it's immediate surroundings were aflame, and the flames rapidly spreading to the
		 surrounding dry debris.
		-The ogre ran, screaming, deeper into the catacombs, and the necromancers followed him in a
		 somewhat more organized retreat.
		-"Nkondi!" I shouted, "Check on Isaias!" Meanwhile, I shook Jade awake.
		-Nkondi looked grim, and began to mutter, saying, "Well, at least they won't have this
		 body. . ."
		-He began to pour lamp oil over Isaias, but I shouted at him, saying, "Stop! Just drag him
		 out of here! There may be something we can still do. . . or something to remember him by."
		-He indeed began to drag, and I soon joined him in a macabre race, dragging the necromancer
		 I downed out of the tunnels too (for clues and profit both!).
		-Once outside the smoke-spewing door of the catacombs, we checked on Isaias, and found he
		 was indeed beyond help.
		-So, we rifled through pockets.
			-The necromancer had unsurprising equipment, the most interesting of which were some
			 scrolls, and also 75 gold. The gold was actually the strangest thing, as the coins were
			 all stamped with the emblem of The Morticians' Guild. . .
			-Digging through Isaias's gear, The Orb of the Brotherhood fell out of a pocket on his
			 backpack, along with a strange iron fork that looks like it would fit in one of
			 the orb's slots.
				-The fork was new to us, and I asked Jade if she knew what it was for.
				-She said she thought it might be a key to one of The Brotherhood's planes, which
				 quickly had me backing away, but she boldly slotted it into the orb.
				-Handling it a moment more, she said she thought that had unlocked some divine
				 power for use by the bearer, but I told her, "You're welcome to keep it, so long
				 as you keep it the hell away from me. . ."
			-Isais also strangely had two holy symbols, both of which I recognized. One was the
			 symbol of the god he professed to follow, Shawn of the Brotherhood, but the other bore
			 the symbol of Enilias, another, sneakier member of The Brotherhood.

7/27/22: A man, a warforged, and a dragonborn walk into a bar. . .
	-That night, the city burned.
		-The guards mostly kept matters under control, and the fires gradually began to gutter out.
		-The rioting too slowly calmed, the obvious targets already having been burned and looted. 
		-I eventually got separated from the others, strolling through the streets with a bottle in
		 one hand and an unsheathed rapier in the other.
		-As I walked through Sasserine's streets, I came upon a(nother) shouting crowd.
		-I elbowed my way to the front of the scrum, I saw a group of city guards, beating a well-
		 rusted warforged with cudgels as he struggled on the ground.
			-Arguing with the guards was a humanoid with golden scales, and the features of a lizard.
			-"What offense did this man commit?" he was asking the guards.
			 "Yeah! What'd he dooo?" I shouted over from the crowd, slurring slightly.
			-"He's not a man," the guard responded to the lizard, practically spitting.
			 "Neither am I. . ." the draconic figure said threateningly.
			 "Well, I suppose that's so. . . But this thing protected a bunch of anarchists. . ."
			 "I think he's had enough," the scaled humanoid said, practically growling now.
			-The guards were starting to look nervous, and the one speaking to the reptilian figure
			 turned to his compatriots and shouted, "OK! Pack it in! We're leaving."
			-They left behind the warforged, battered despite heavy armor that was nearly as worn as
			 it's wearer.
			-Curious, I approached the scaled figure and asked him, "Are you related to the party
			 lizard?"
			-He chuckled and said, "I've heard stories, but alas no."
			-After my interruption, he continued to fiddle with his belt, and then reaching out at
			 the warforged, a flash of light suggested it bore some magic property, and, indeed, the
			 warforged was soon clambering back up onto his feet, some what less worse for the wear.
			-"You must be friends," it said, "To have healed me. I am E3-SOMETHING, but my friends
			 call me 'Rusty'."
				-"I'm Fred!" I said. "Fred the Red!"
				-"What was this all about?" the warforged's draconic savior asked.
				 "They were teenagers. The guards would have harmed them. Better me."
				-The warforged looked around itself and then said, "We should seek shelter."
				 "I think there's a bar a block over there?" I responded. "If not, the one after!"
		-As we made our way that direction, the lizard spoke up, introducing himself as "Sarge".
			-"Military?" the warforged asked.
			 "Yeah," Sarge replied, and they fell to reminiscing.
			 ". . . the battalion was all wiped out," Sarge finished.
			 "Between jobs now, huh?" I asked him. "There are a lot of party lizard jobs in this
			  city."
			 "I have. . . a more specialized set of skills," was his reply.
			 "I haven't had a decent job since the war. . ." Rusty mumbled, diconsolately, and
			 recounted the loss of _his_ entire battalion.
			-Looking at back at me, Sarge then said, "I saw your speech."
		     "Yeah, lost a friend too. . ." I said. "He's a hero now! Gotta do what you can to
			  remember your friends. . ."
		-When we got to the bar, we found the word "closed" hastily painted across it's door.
			-None the less, I pulled out a gold piece and began to clink it against the door, slowly
			 and rythmically.
			-Eventually, a voice called out from inside, shouting, "Go away! We're closed!"
			 "We just want a drink!" I replied. "Open up! Things are calming down and people are
			  going to have a thirst!"
			 "How do I know you're not ruffians?" the voice inside responded.
			 "Would ruffians pay the cover?" I shouted, sliding three gold beneath the bar's door.
			-Soon, I could hear someone tugging at the bar behind the door, and it was opened.
			-"Sorry," the apparent proprietor said. "We had some trouble in here earlier and, well,
			 with the state of the city tonight, we figured we'd better lock up for the evening.
			 "Oh, it's no problem!" I replied. "And just perfect for me! I was looking for a quiet
			  conversation with my new friends anyways!"
			-He ushered us quickly inside, barring the door behind us, and I then handed him several
			 more gold for a round for all of us.
				-Sarge ordered some kind of devil gin the barkeep talked up.
				-I, meanwhile, asked for a cup of red wine. Turning to my new friends, and gesturing
				 at my red doublet, I said, "It doesn't show if I get it on the attire!"
					-Blatently ignoring the various reddish stains that already dotted it after this
					 evening. . .
				-"Do you have any grease?" Rusty asked the barkeep, avoiding any awkward silence
				 there.
				 "Good for the joints, eh? It's the hells getting old!" I commented.
				 "After the first millennia, things get rough. . ."
			 -Once served, Sarge raised his glass in toast, saying, "Thanks, Fred!"
			  "To new friends and old, silver and gold," I toasted.
			  "And rusted," Rusty flatly responded.
			 -"What brings you to the city?" Sarge asked me, as we drank.
			  "I'm seeking news of the world, and trade opportunities. A patron wants to know. What
			   about you? What brings you to Sasserine?" I deflected.
			  "I'm looking for work. My battalion, we flew aboard airships, but I'd now take
			   whatever work presents itself for a warrior."
			  "Airships, huh?" I asked, perking back up. "That's music to my ears! I myself fly on,
			   lets say, a _very_ light frigate!"
			  "Ah," Sarge responded. "I would very much like to return to the air. It speaks to the
			   souls of the dragonborn, this connection to our forebearers."
			  "Few warforged served aboard airships," Rusty broke in. "Too heavy, to have a whole
			   unit of us. Plus, they worried we might share. . . a certain solidarity, with the
			   bound air elementals that power them."
			 -Rusty then broke into an extended anecdote about the depressing history of his kind.
			  ". . . that sleep then lasted centuries. It was not our will, but part of a treaty,
			   and it brought peace."
			 -"Just once," he continued, "I would like to fight for a cause I believe in. And I
			   would like to fly in your ship."
			  "Well. . . welcome aboard, I guess! Stick close to me big targ. . . guy, and we'll go
			   far!"
			 -Rusty then made a suggestion, saying "I am in poor shape for a fight right now, but
			  I do have a stash of healing potions and other equipment not far from here, if you
			  wish to accompany me and retrieve it."
			  "Might want to wait until the sun comes up," I protested. "Things are calming down,
			   but they'll be a lot calmer once it's brighter."
			 -It was still the early hours of the morning, so we settled in at the bar, having
			  another couple rounds and some food.
				-"I do not require rest," Rusty volunteered. "I can stand guard, though, if you wish
				  to."
				-Letting out a yawn, I said, "Yeah, I could use some shut-eye. . . maybe nap in this
				 booth for a bit. . ."
				-Rusty got up, marched stiff-backed to the door, back to the table, and then
				 repeated that, at least through when I nodded off.
		-When next I opened my eyes, it was to Nkondi walking into the bar.
			-"Hey! Nkondi!" I cried out. "How's it going! Have a drink! I still have half a wine
			  here somewhere. . ."
			-He sat with us, and drew forth his own bottle of rum from his pack.
			-We did a round of introductions, and Nkondi asked after the sorry state of Rusty.
			-"He needs repairs," I responded. "But he said he had a stash of stuff for it nearby."
			-"Speaking of which," I continued, "How's the city, Nkondi?"
			-He claimed there was still a fair amount of chaos, roving mobs and looters.
			-"Ah, OK! We were thinking we'd relax here for a bit, while things calm down, and then,
			  pick up Rusty's shit."
			-The barkeeper pestered Nkondi a bit, but Nkondi threw some coins to him.
			-Nkondi then began talking to something that was not there, and he and Rusty got into a
			 conversation about spirits, leading eventually to Sarge chiming in as Rusty began to
			 reminisce about ancient history. Rusty apparently wants to find the ghost of a dead
			 friend, but I soon lost interest in the whole thing, paying more attention to swirling
			 my wine.
		-We eventually bedded back down, and awoke with the sky light, the streets coming back to
		 normal life, though there were still more guards than usual walking the streets, and often
		 jeers or stones thrown their way, from the populace.
			-Nkondi did a lot of staring at the construct, while I announced, "I'm going to go find
			 the barkeep, and see if he can scare us up some breakfast."
			-Soon, we were eating, and discussing going to find Rusty's stash as our next order of
			 business.
	-Walking out onto the street, the city was indeed tense.
		-As we walked, we saw some of the guards pasting up posters. Approaching one such, we found
		 it showed a terrible likeness of _me_, along with the words, "Wanted for disturbing the
		 peace. Reward is 100 gold."
		-Well, this city is burned. Where to next, I guess?
		-Rounding a corner, we saw a wizard watched over by a couple of guards, magically creating
		 a larger image of some (mostly) bullshit stuff I _supposedly_ did at the funeral.
		-Nkondi wasted no time in hurling the coffee in his hand at the wizard, scoring a hit and
		 provoking some sputtering rage.
		-The guards began to cast their eyes about for who threw it, and Nkondi (probably unwisely)
		 began shouting, saying, "They're despoiling the memory of our heros, with their lies!"
		-"Yeah, listen to him!" I joined in. "These guys are shit!"
		-Soon, the nearby citizens were shouting and throwing refuse at the guards.
		-Nkondi then (actually wisely) turned and ran. I was quick in following him and, after a
		 glance between them, Sarge and Rusty were following too.
		-Rounding a corner, we paused to gather our breath (those of us that needed it), and to
		 disguise ourselves, Nkondi with a spell and I by turning my coat inside out and mussing my
		 hair.
	-Rusty then led us to where his stash was, in a sewer.
		-On the way there, he warned us of some "guardian", that would need a password.
		-"Sure, sure, Rustbucket," I said. "You've got that right?"
		-He just turned and walked on.
		-Arriving at the mouth of a sewer, where it emptied into the ocean, Rusty stopped us short,
		 and, from the pool beneath it, rose a hulking, headless figure, it's face emerging straight
		 from it's shoulders.
		-The creature blocked our way, standing there blankly, while Rusty almost stammered, ". . . 
		 I knew this. . . what was the word. . . let me search my memory banks. Does anyone know
		 the tongues of the elementals?"
		-I volunteered some smattering of Auran, to no real avail, while Nkondi chatted with things
		 I could not see, eventually muttering, "Understanding?"
			-I voiced the word in Auran, apparently sparking some recollection in Rusty, who uttered
			 something in one of the other elemental tongues, prompting the creature to sink back
			 into his pool.
		-Rusty walked towards the opening, and I steeled myself to follow, but Sarge protested,
		 saying, "I'm not going in there. I don't do water. I'll guard the entrance."
		-"Very well," Rusty replied, wading into the sewage.
		-Fortunately it was not too far inside that Rusty led us, retrieving from an alcove his
		 "repair kit" and pouring some apparently magical oils over himself.
		-We emerged, stinking, to some scornful looks from Sarge.
			-Well, we'll see how good he smells without any baths, if he's really so afraid of water.
	-"So," Sarge said, turning to me, "You said you had a way out of the city?"
		-"Yep!" I replied. "We'll have to make our way to docks. I've got some friends that'll be
		  pretty sore if I leave them behind, though."
		 "Where are these friends?" Rusty asked.
		 "One's off with her family. Not sure what happened to Jade. Lost track of her last night."
		-"Well," I continued, "They know where the ship is. Maybe they'll meet us there!"
	-On the way to the docks, we also stopped by a likely seeming shop, looking to unload last
	 night's loot.
		-Dedicated weapon shops had been closed by order of The Dawn Council, but we found a
		 somewhat disreputable pawn shop run by a self-described "personal defense enthusiast".
		-We sold our loot, and I got myself some silver arrows.
	-We then took our leave and walked on towards the docks.
		-Ascending to the skydocks, we were stopped at the top of the stair by a group of guards.
		-They asked us if we'd seen me, pointing at one of the wanted posters one held.
		-I assured them we'd never associate with such rabble, but Sarge had to open his big lizard
		 mouth too, and they suspected he was full of shit.
		-Sarge began to threaten them and, half in support of theat and half to defuse things, I
 		 broke in, saying, "Do you know who he _is_? He's the party lizard! A genuine celebrity!"
		 "Huh! I've heard tales of him," one of the guards responded. "They said he could drink a
		  whole cask."
		 "Two," Sarge growled in response.
		 "Well, the party lizard knew Fredrick! We better take this lot in for questioning!"
			-Shit.
		-"Look, you don't want to do that!" I began. "You'd be messing with a _celebrity_. It'll be
		  a whole thing!"
		 "Tell us where he is, then, and maybe we can be done with this."
		 "OK, look, we were supposed to be here for the party lizard's big return. We were going
		  to see Fredrick at the bar where it all started," I said. "You know the. . ."
		 "Lusty Leopard?" one of the guards volunteered.
		 "Yeah, the Lusty Leper! Though why anyone would want to drink in a place like that. . ."
		 "No, _Leopard_," the guard clarified. "The owner couldn't spell, and the 'D' fell off. . ."
		 "Ugh! His 'D' fell off?!?" I went on.
		 At that point the apparent leader of the group broke in, shouting, "Forget it! If Fredrick
		 is supposed to be there, then we'll take you over there and you can point him out."
		 "Uh. . . sure," I shrugged.
	-Somewhere in that exchange, Nkondi apparently slipped off, the spell camouflaging him still
	 being in effect, so the guards led the three of us they'd seen back down to the streets of the
	 city.
		-This could have gone better. . .
		-They led us to the bar, and questioned the patrons, who all said they'd not seen the person
		 on the poster, with thankfully none of them pointing at the man standing with the guards. . .
		-"Well, where is he?" one of the guards asked us.
		 "Beats me! He was supposed to meet us here. Though the event wasn't supposed to start until
		  nine. . ."
		 "We can't wait here for hours!"
		 "Aw, come on!" I wheedled, "Lets get some food and see if they turn up! This place is great!"
		 "Well, it is almost lunch time. . ."
		 "Great! Barkeep! Get us each the lunch special, and a round of those strong ales!"
		-We sat down to some food, but the guards were distressingly resistant to my efforts to get
		 them to really drinking.
		-As they finished off their food, the ales mostly untouched in front of them, one of them
		 began to stand, saying, "Well, we've waited long enough. Lets take you over to the station."
		-Sarge then lept to his feet, his chair clattering to the floor behind him, snarling and
		 flexing his claws. The fight was on.
		-We made short work of the guards, especially after Sarge set several of them on fire.
		-Turning to the terrified crowd as I darted towards the door, I shouted, "Our work here is
		 done! Stick around a bit, and the next round's on me!"
		-I tossed a fist full of gold towards the bar and turned to my companions, saying, "Lets get
		 the fuck out of here guys."
	-As we left the bar, we ran into a young boy, who had a message for us from Nkondi. It said,
	 "Guards on ship, look at local billboards. we should leave for a while. meet at the home of the
	  original Reverie Reptile tomorrow morning."
		-Well, that plan's shot.
		-"Want me to take a message back?" the kid asked. "It'll only cost you, uh, a gold?"
		 "How about this, kid?" I said. "If you know how to find the one who sent this, take _us_
		  there and you'll get your gold."
		 "Really?!? Alright! This way!"
		-The boy led us back toward the docks, pointing out Nkondi lurking in the shadow of a closed
		 market stall just outside them.
	-Reunited with Nkondi, we resolved to find the others, and to get the hells out of this city.
		-We were unsure where to find Jade but, in the course of describing her and her interests,
		 Sarge volunteered that he knew of a well regarded magical foundry in the city that rented
		 workspace.
			-Following him there, and inside, I indeed spotted Jade bent over a workbench in the
			 back of the large, open building.
			-I approached and greeted her, and she was full of recriminations about how out of hand
			 things had gotten last night.
			-I agreed that things were a mess, and suggested it was time to get the hells out of the
			 city, before any of the consequnces for that all fell on _our_ heads.
			-Before we left, I also helped her disguise herself, warning her that the guards seemed
			 unpleasantly interested in speaking with us, eliciting a sigh in response.
		-Jade, a local, knew where to find the estate of House Dracus, so she led the way from there.
			-Suspecting these high-brow folks might not take kindly to strangers on the doorstep, I
			 concocted a ruse with my medal from The Dawn Council.
			-Knocking on the door, I told the rather rude servant that answered that, "Lady Maya
			 left this medal behind where she dined two nights ago. The proprietor asked me to
			 deliver it to her. Let her know I'm waiting out here, if she feels compelled to offer
			 a reward. . ."
			-The butler continued to be a general ass about the whole affair, and there were a few
			 holes in the plan, I having forgotten Maya hadn't joined us until _after_ we earned
			 that, and he apparently being well aware of both what it was and that Maya had not
			 received one.
			-Nonetheless, after impressing on him that it's _clearly_ valuable, and something she'd
			 not want to lose if she _did_ leave it there, the prick eventually took it to her, and
			 she emerged from the estate a short while later."
			-I explained our trouble, and our planned departure from the city aboard the airship.
			-She seemed tempted to go with us, but also reluctant to abandon her family in an
			 apparent hour of need.
				-They'd been tasked with tracking down an influx of counterfeit currency, and Maya
				 felt she was unable to leave them until the matter was resolved.
				-Instead, she gave me a coin bearing the emblem of her house, saying that she would
				 be able to Teleport to it once she was free.
				 "Well, if you've got the cash for something like that, that works!" I said. "See
				  you in a bit!"
				-Turning to the rest of the group, I said, "Sounds like it's time to get the back to
				 the ship and to get the fuck out of here. Back to the docks!"


8/10/22:
	-We decided to do some asking around, near the docks, to get some idea of what we're getting into.
		-In a dockside bar, I met a grizzled dwarf, who complained that, "Since the old dockmaster
		 died, the place has been a mess!"
		 "What a shame!" I replied. "What if the city were attacked? Have the defenses been
		  neglected? Does the city maintain no ships?"
		 "Maybe some ships," he said, "Though you'd think they would have used them last night during
		  the riots. They must have _some_ defenses. . ."
		-Taking our leave of the dwarf, we grabbed a table, and spent some time disguising ourselves.
		-Our disguises in place, we stepped outside the bar, only to see Maya walking around the
		 street outside, observing the docks herself.
		-I got her attention, and let her know it was me beneath the disguise (a thing she _claimed_
		 she already knew. . .).
		-We returned to the bar, to catch up with her.
			-It seemed she was now amenable to leaving, and that her pursuit of the counterfeiters
			 was now going to lead her to a dwarven city, one she'd very much like to visit with us.
		-So, we discussed the plan. Figuring we'd try talking first, we came up with a ruse to claim
		 Maya's family had just purchased the impounded ship.
		-Nkondi was interested in "conferring with the ancestors", and changing his spells, so we
		 decided to rent some rooms and attempt this tomorrow.
			-I spent some of the intervening time spreading rumors of the ship purchase, hanging
			 around bars near the docks, talking about the "sale", and my new life as an airman.
			-We even encountered some off duty guards at one, and made sure they overheard my
			 discussion with Maya about the ship's sale.
			-Eventually, I joined Nkondi at a graveyard, where he was performing his ritual, before
			 we turned in.
				-It was quite the show! If Edric's church involved this much rum, drums, and
				 shouting, I might have been more religious.
				-Apparently _his_ gods (or ancestors or whatever) demand booze. In particular, he
				 asked me what I knew about old booze, saying he might appease his patron with such.
					-Talking about it, elves came up, and he mentioned a "Castle Arakhain", on the
					 mainland, that might have ancient vintages. Sounds like a good stop to me!
			-Finally, we found an inn, and got some rest.
	-The next morning, we got our disguises together, and headed over to the airship docks.
		-We did have to talk our way onto the docks themselves, due to a heavy guard presence, but
		 they bought our story about Maya buying a ship.
		-"Well, Lady Dracus, shall we make our inspection?" I asked and, at her nod, we began
		 walking towards the ship.
		-The guards aboard ship bought the story about the sale, and we even convinced them that the
		 lady would be taking it for a quick cruise, though they insisted on staying aboard.
		-Taking the ship out over the sea, we consulted with one another, and decided to take the
		 ship down low and toss the guards into the sea, with a crate to serve as a float.
			-Eh, whatever soothes the others' consciences. I just want my ship back.
		-While I was busy with the ships wheel, Nkondi summoned a pair of vultures below deck, used
		 them to distract the guards, and took Maya "hostage".
		-Threatening her, he demanded the guards drop their weapons, and, when they complied, Rusty
		 tied them up.
		-He then turned Maya over to Jade, who led her below deck.
		-Nkondi then began to escalate things, muttering prayers to is ancestors over one of the
		 bound guards and drawing a knife.
		-His intentions rather clear, a panicked guard slipped his (apparently shoddily tied)
		 bonds and made a break for it.
		-While Nkondi was busy with that, Sarge made a "join or die" speech, attempting to press-
		 gang the others.
		-The guards were looking fearful after that, but not professing their loyalty or anything
		 like that.
		-Nkondi ignored the fleeing guard, stabbing one of those still bound in his throat, while
		 his summoned birds savaged two more of them.
		-Soon, it devolved into combat, an admittedly one-sided one, due to the guards having
		 dropped their weapons already.
		-By the time Jade and Maya came back up on deck to investigate the noise, Nkondi had
		 already cut the hearts out of several of the dead guards, and the bodies had all been
		 thrown overboard from the bloodstained deck.
	-With some free time now, we consulted a map of the region in (my) cabin: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1007116989568925766
		-Sharaar Kol, the dwarven city Maya wished to visit, was not far, near the shore of Manta
		 Bay, where Sasserine, an island city, is located.
		-We set a course for the dwarven city.


TODO:
	-Express some remorse over the dead guards.
		-"Some of them might have been willing to join up!"
		-But, you were distracted by how good it felt to be at the wheel of your ship again!
			-Real freedom at last!
			-Sasserine was getting a bit stifling. You know, being recognized and all.


8/24/22:
	-Inspecting the ship, it looks like they even topped up our air elementals!
	-After 2 days in the air, we sighted misty mountains ahead, the Greywall range, and soon spotted
	 the city's air docks.
		-Flanked by two enormous statues, they were carved into the side of a mountain.
		-There was very little traffic, but we directed to an empty berth by a sunrod-waving dwarf.
	-We were met by a dwarf, apparently an employee of the docks.
		-By the time I'd finished tying the ship up at the berth and ran over, he'd already launched
		 into the usual questions about cargo declarations and such with the others.
		-I did some minor schmoozing, but he seemed stubbornly resistant to flattery.
		-He did inform us that, "The upper city is for traders. Outsiders like you. Lower city is
		 for dwarves."
		 "Perfect! Point the way!" I replied.
		 "It's down the spiral stair, there. About 30 minutes down."
		-At the thought of that many stairs, I turned to Rusty, saying, ". . . Rusty, have you ever
		 heard of a 'piggy-back ride'?"
		 "No?"
		 "Perfect! We're going to practice a new technique! Here, let me clamber up onto your
		  back. . . Huh, look! No hands! . . .I bet I can even use a bow from up here!"
	-As we walked down, it was indeed an interminable trip down. Soon, everyone, save Rusty and
	 myself, was breathing hard.
		-While we walked, Maya talked, telling us more about the matter of forged signet rings her
		 family had tasked her with investigating.
			-She showed an example, demonstrating how, by some complex mechanism or magic, it could
			 change from a generic looking symbol to another, matching one of the Sasserine sigils
			 I remember from a banner when we were declared heroes of Sasserine.
			-In return for our help with this matter, she said her family could help smooth things
			 over for us in Sasserine.
			-"That'd be nice," I said, "But we also need to bring in some coin to keep the ship
			  flying."
			 "Well, we'll have to keep an eye out for opportunities to trade along they way, then,"
			 she replied.
	-Finally reaching the bottom of the stair, we gazed upon a bustling village within a cavern,
	 centered around a statue of a dwarf. Small buildings filled the floor of the cavern, with
	 crystals growing among them.
	-As we stood about for a bit, I suggested we next find some lodgings, a base of operations,
	 and perhaps some of the famed dwarven ale. We decided to ask around, for recommendations.
		-Greeting a dwarf standing idle out in fron of a shop, he suggested "The Crystallized
		 Pig", a bar and inn.
		-He also spoke of an "Old Foam Beard", whose capacity for drink was legendary.
			-I've got to meet this guy. He sounds like a blast.
		-In the course of this, Maya referred to me twice as "our captain". A good start on my
		 future, that.
	-Following the directions given, we entered The Crystallized Pig, and Maya immediately began
	 conversing with the innkeep in Dwarvish.
		-They seemed to get along splendidly, and Maya had soon arranged (and paid for) rooms for
		 all of us, for four days, and a round of a strong ale that turned out to be _fantastic_.
		-Drinks in front of us, we then discussed our next move.
		-Maya intended to visit local craftsmen, and figure out who would be capable of such work.
		-I agreed that sounded promising, but also said that we had a craftswoman right here,
		 suggesting that Jade take a look.
		-Obliging, Jade examined the ring, mentioning that it used an odd flux, something we could
		 potentially use to identify other works by the same group.
	-While this went on, May also apparently did some eavesdropping. Leaning in, she gestured to a
	 nearby table, where three dwarves sat, and said that they'd apprently lost a friend.
		-Two of the dwarves looked like warriors, while the third was garbed as a cleric.
		-"Perhaps, she said, "If we help them, they can help us access the lower city? Assisting in
		  our investigation?"
		-Agreeing it sounded promising, I volunteered to take point.
		-I walked up to the bar and asked the innkeep for another four of the "Wicked Trident" that
		 we'd been drinking, taking them over to the dwarves' table.
		-"Hi! My friend over there," I said, gesturing to Maya, "She speaks the language, and heard
		  you lost a friend. Death is hard. . . gone forever. . . Here, I wanted to offer my
		  condolences, and a round of the reserve."
		 "Aye? You have our thanks, though maybe he's not lost forever. . ." one of them responded.
		 "Ah, not the permanent parting, then? Good!"
		 "Eh, perhaps that would have been easier. . ." he replied.
		 "How so? Most anything is better than death. . ."
		 "He went insane. . . We were down in the mines, exploring a collapsed section of cave.
		  Only he was nimble enough to squeeze through. When he came back, though, he was insisted
		  we return to the city, and began behaving strangely. . . We had to cut ties with him, and
		  he's now in prison. . ." he said, trailing off. Taking another drink, he perked up a bit,
		  saying, "Hey, this is good stuff!"
		 "Perhaps we can help! There are various magics that can affect the mind. Perhaps he's
		  been enscrolled," I said. "Several among us are well versed in such things, we could
		  examine him. Does the prison accept vistors?"
		 "I'm not sure. No one has ever asked. It wouldn't do for a dwarf to be seen associating
		  with a lawbreaker."
		 "Well," I replied, "We could try it. I don't get the impression that the opinion most
		  here have of outsiders could get much lower. . ."
		 "Who is your friend?" Maya broke in and asked.
		 "Codwell. We called him, Cod, or 'Half-Beard'. Shamefully, he was born with a beard
		  covering only half of his face. A great shame. . . but he worked hard, and earned his
		  keep."
		 "We'll see what we can do," Maya replied, "It would help, though, if we could see the
		  cave where his incident occurred."
		-They then began discussing directions to a cave with an opening to the surface, some miles
		 from the city, overland.
		-Maya and the dwarves continued to socialize while I savored my remaining ale, until their
		 conversation took a disturbing turn, and caught my attention again.
			-They were discussing the history of the city, and it's founder, Sharaar Kol, for whom
			 the city was named. "He dug the city's first mine," the dwarf was saying, "And found a
			 purple crystal the size of his beard. It entranced a _god_. . ."
			 "What god?" Maya asked.
			 "The great creator god," the dwarf replied. "Have you heard of Edric? He saw great
			  psionic power in the crystal, and made a deal for it, offering the city his
			  protection."
			-I began to look distinctly uncomfortable, and the crystals growing around the city
			 took on a quite sinister aspect for me. . .
	-Though I'd quite lost my appetite, the others insisted on finishing their lunches, but we soon
	 headed to the prison.
		-Walking inside, we could indeed see a dwarf with half a beard in one of the cells.
		-We were stopped by another, a guard, who asked our business.
		-"We wanted to speak to one of the prisoners," I said, "He might know about a dangerous
		  hazard nearby."
		-He shrugged and asked, "Which one?"
		 "The one with half a beard," I said.
		-He led us over to the dwarf's cell.
		-Looking at the dwarf, I could tell he was clearly enscrolled, and Nkondi agreed. Cod calmly
		 spoke nonsense, babbling about river monsters, but his eyes looked at us, pleadlingly, with
		 seemingly no connection to his speech.
	-Well, we began debating options for breaking the unknown enchantment.
		-Though Jade looked thoughtful, rummaging through her pack and looking through books she
		 drew forth from it, none of us came up with an option we could personally manage.
		-So, we headed back to bar, hoping Cod's priestly friend could dispell the magic affecting
		 him, or at least know someone who could manage it.
		-That, though, turned into an acrimonious religious discussion.
			-The cleric seemed none too fond of his roguish friend Cod.
			-Meanwhile, Nkondi was doing his very best to antagonize the cleric, questioning both
			 his motives and his faith, and insulting his god.
		-Before that got too far out of hand, though, Jade looked up from one of her books and
		 interrupted, shouting, "Oh! I've got it! I can fix him!"
	-Taking our leave of Cod's friends, we went back to the prison to see him again.
		-"We came back to knock some sense into one of your prisoners," I told the guard.
		-Jade clarified that she had a method that would dispell the magic affecting Cod.
		-Taking a glove, she smeared it with magical reagents and muttered incantations over it.
		-Then, drawing close to the bars and calling Cod over to her, she slapped him across the face
		 with it.
		-Casting his eyes about at his surroundings, and then back to us, Cod asked, "What in the
		 hells happened?"
		 "You've been talking crazy," Jade said, "And got locked in prison because of it."
		 ". . . huh?"
		 "You were enscrolled, my good dwarf!" I told him. "Something in that cave you squeezed into
		  seems to have done it. What did you find in there?"
		 "There was a. . . river of. . . arcane energy. In it, there was a. . . it looked like a
		  ham. . . some hunk of meat."
		-Glancing at my fellows, I asked, ". . . Are you sure your glove worked, Jade?"
		-That elicited awkward laughs from all of us, save Nkondi. "I've heard of a necromantic
		 ritual," he said, "Preserving brains in jars. A river of magic could preserve and sustain
		 something similarly. . ."
		-Nkondi was suddenly very eager to visit this cave, and Sarge was curious too.
		-"Visiting the local tourist attractions is all well and good, guys, but we did also solve,
		  well, most of Cod's problems," I said. "Guard! He's in much better shape now. Are you able
		  to let him out?"
		 "He hasn't served out his sentence yet," the guard replied.
		 "What was he sentenced to?" I asked, as Nkondi spoke over me, asking, "What was he sentenced
		  _for_?"
		 "A year," the guard replied, "For disturbing the peace."
		-Nkondi then worked himself up into a good rant, saying the man had received a. . . _vision_
		 of great danger, and asking how they could imprison this _prophet_. "You would imprison
		 Moradin himself!" he finished.
		-Somewhat to my surprise, the guard seemed a bit shaken. Perhaps he's a bit more religious
		 than I, for he turned to the prisoner and asked him a series of questions in dwarvish.
		-Apparently satisfied with the answers, the guard agreed to let him go, after making him
		 swear some kind of oath (again in dwarvish). He did turn to us first, though, and asked,
		 "Can you give him an extra slap to be sure?"
		 "Doesn't hurt to be sure!" I enthusiastically replied, "Well, doesn't hurt _us_. . ."
	-Once Cod was free of his cell, I asked him if he was ready to return to his friends.
		-He actually seemed a bit reluctant, particularly to face the judgy cleric, but he
		 eventually agreed to walk back with us to the inn.
		-On the way, I pressed him for more details of what he saw.
		-Beyond the river meat, he described ornate pillars in the cave, and. . . beasts, that
		 seemed to be under the meat's control.
		-"What do you think it wanted, with sending me back to the city?" he also speculated.
		 "Ha!" I laughed. "Probably to lure more victims back to it. . ."
		 "You might not be wrong," he said.
		 "Probably not! It's working, after all," I replied, looking around at my companions.
	-Walking back into the tavern with him, the cleric looked a bit ashamed at the sight of his
	 erstwhile companion, while Cod immediately set into berating him.
		-"You were going to _leave_ me there. A year!"
		-Nkondi happily egged him on to, and joined in berating the cleric, saying, "I don't know
		 whether Moradin was too useless or you to cowardly to help. . ."
		-Much shouting amongst the dwarves ensued, with Nkondi trying to start a fight while Maya
		 tried to calm them down, and me leaning up against the bar, new drink in hand, watching
		 the show.
		-Maya got the better of that, and soon the two dwarves were hugging, to my slight
		 disappointment.
		-Nkondi even procured some kind of shot from the bartender, and approached the cleric with
		 it, apparently as some kind of peace offering.
			-The cleric sniffed it, then poured half of it into an empty glass and shoving it toward
			 Nkondi.
			-They each downed their respective portions. The cleric then immediately vomited
			 violently onto the table between them, followed by Nkondi doing the same seconds later.
			-The bartender began yelling at them to get the hells out. Nkondi slipped him a gold
			 coin and adjourned to his room, while the cleric walked out the door, shaking his head.
		-The rest of the evening proceeded apace, with Jade also drinking heavily (I'd never seen
		 her drink at all), then vomitting in a corner and being helped up to her room by Maya.
		-Sarge and I paced ourselves a bit better, and sat in the common room a while longer,
		 listening to the towns rumors and news.
			-Apparently the mayor has a new limp he's not saying anything about.
			-Sarge was quite the hit, with several people stopping by, asking him about his origins
			 and if he knew of any dragons around the area.
				-No dragons near that he knows, and he's from Stormreach, a militiaman tranformed
				 to what he is in the name of war. Previously, he'd been some kind of catman.
		-Eventually, even we turned in for the night, resting before we travel to the cave tomorrow.


TODO:
	-Shopping before setting out? You've got a number of items of interest below.
		-MW Composite longbow and the haversack?
		-_Probably_ not enough time for Jade to craft something, before visiting the cave?
		-You have a small bit of loot from the guards to sell too.


9/7/22: Squeezing Cash from Dwarves
	-The next morning, we all slowly trickled back down to the common room for breakfast, save Jade,
	 who Maya said was still feeling quite sick.
	-There, between mouthfuls of excellent bacon (of provenance still unknown to me), we discussed
	 our next move.
	-Still intent on seeing what this "river ham" is about, we decided we'd see to provisions (and
	 arms) for an exepedition.
		-Maya spoke with the innkeep, asking him for recommendations for armorers and purveyors of
		 enchantments.
		-We then took his advice, and sought out the Vault of Miredhel, an arms merchant.
			-We also had Rusty meet us there with the equipment from the late guards, procuring some
			 loose change.
			-As we walked in, there was a jerk-y elf arguing with the dwarven proprietor.
				-He was complaining he'd been ripped off by the dwarf in question, sold a defective
				 bow. I could see he was full of shit, though, so I jumped in on the dwarf's side
				 of things (I _may_ also have had my eye on a discount).
			-He talked me into a masterwork darkwood bow (530 gp.).
			-He had a range in back, for me to try it out, and I did some schmoozing as we walked
			 back there.
			-Eventually I talked _him_ into a 5% discount.
			-Maya then inquired after her own purchase, a dwarf-wrought shield, getting a darkwood
			 piece herself.
		-Next stop was an alchemist, then, Maya apparently being interested in some healing potions
		 (prudent!).
			-Appropriate for a barkeep's recommendation, the shop apparently specialized in hangover
			 cures, so we made sure to bring a course back for Jade.
			-Maya got some healing potions and sunrods.
			-The alchemist also recommended a provisioner.
		-Rusty still hadn't arrived with the equipment we meant to sell, though, so we figured we
		 better check on him.
			-Taking the lift up, we found Rusty arguing with the dwarf manning the top of it.
			-He was clearly trying to shake Rusty down, demanding 100 gp. to go down it with his
			 "freight".
			-Maya, Nkondi, and I began to tear into him.
				-Aghast, Maya asked the dwarf, "You don't want people below to know what you're
				 doing up here, taking advantage of travelers. . ."
				-"Ever seen the inside of a dwarven prison? I have. . ." I chimed in.
				-Pretty quickly he was sputtering, and agreed to wave the fee for us, if we would
				 just keep our mouths shut.
				-Not content, I continued pressuring the dwarf, saying, "That's not good enough. We
				 need some recompense for our time, here. Do you know the value of the business deal
				 you've risked by hassling our courier?"
				-"50 gold pieces," Nkondi finished for me, "And a finger for each gold you're short."
				-He gave in pretty quickly, tossing us his purse, which Nkondi carefully counted.
					-He also agreed to free lift rides, and gave us his name (at knife point),
					 Imundos.
		-Back down the lift, then, and off to the provisioner.
			-Walking inside the marked shop, we were greeted by the aroma of various cured meats.
			-Nkondi purchased a _huge_ amount of "Pemmican", having most of it delivered to the ship,
			 to serve as rations.
			-Aside from strange, dried meats, they also had the sort of magic bag I was looking for,
			 and I picked up a Handy Haversack.
	-(We then paused there, Jake being short on time, post-wedding, and several people having to
	  bow out. We'll set out for the cave next time.)


TODO:
	-(DONE!) We still need to do XP for last session. Jake said he'd post it in Discord.


9/21/22:
    -We followed the directions of the dwarven adventurers, flying our ship to wetlands studded with
     rocky outcroppings, themselves pockmarked by caves.
        -It was a day and a half's flight from the dwarven city of Sharaar Kol.
        -We picked a likely seeming set of caves, based on our directions, and brought the ship
         down low.
        -We decided to leave Rusty guarding the the airship, and to keep it circling.
            -If he runs into anything he can't handle, he's to flee with it to Sharaar Kol, but is
             otherwise to look out for our signal or the flight-capable Sarge.
        -Sarge was first overboard, scouting the site from the air, while the rest of us lowered
         rope ladders and climbed down.
        -As we descended, Sarge pointed out a nearby cave mouth streaked with unusual colors.
    -Approaching the indicated cave mouth, we could indeed see it covered in. . . something.
        -There were streaks of various bright colors leading into the cave, sometimes seeming solid
         and sometimes. . . flowing?
        -Maya said it felt chaotic, perhaps magic aligned to that axis. She mumbled something about
         weapons from "The Great War".
        -As we stepped inside, we could hear the noise of. . . something, scurrying away from us,
         deeper into the caves.
        -Listening closely, I could also hear a buzzing? I asked if anyone else heard bees, but the
         mystery was soon revealed as first one, then another blue lizard stepped into the circle of
         our light, electricity crackling and arcing along their bodies.
            -Their veins also pulsed with a greenish light.
        -As they scurried towards us, one of them snapping at Sarge, I stepped behind our scaled
         defender, and loosed an arrow at the scaly thing snapping at him.
        -The arrow struck home, wounding the dog-sized beast, but the wound also sprayed something
         noxious looking, eating into the stone at Sarge's feet, sizzling.
        -Sarge whipped a frosty magical orb at it for it's trouble.
        -As the second one joined the fray, electricity began to arc between the two lizards,
         catching Sarge with a jolt.
        -I backed away from the melee as Nkondi joined it, and, between the two of us, we dropped
         the first of the lizards.
        -Sarge continued hurling magical orbs at the remaining lizard while it raced toward me.
        -I got to do some lightening dodging, and did so flawlessly. Like ballet.
        -This went on for some time, longer than I would have liked, but I eventually pinned the
         second lizard to the cavern floor too, scoring both kills!
    -After the lizard battle, both Maya and Sarge reported difficulties with their magics.
        -Nkondi, though, said he felt none such. Perhaps something specific to the arcane? Maybe
         tied to the strange veins of color?
        -Maya explored that last hypothesis, holding a hand against one vein, and Jade soon joined
         her in examining it with a lense she removed from her pack.
        -They deemed it. . . something, with simultaneously wild and powerful magic flowing through
         it, but didn't know if it was related to our arcanists' difficulties.
        -Jade said something about a "fish" in the "stream", and said she thought it might be our
         "river ham"?
        -Nkondi, though, hit on the interesting idea of _following_ this "stream". Guided by Jade's
         monocole and Nkondi's spirit sight, we followed it through the Easternmost of two passages,
         deeper into the caves.
    -As we followed this stream of magic, Nkondi, in the lead, was surprised by an assault by. . .
     something, a blob of grayish ooze.
        -It was disgusting, and Jade warned us it can dissolve stuff, but was also quickly dispatched
         by a hail of projectiles from Jade, Maya, and myself.
        -Poking around in it with a quickly dissolving arrow, it seemed we were not it's first prey,
         but nothing in the acidic mess seemed to have remained intact.
    -As we followed the "stream" deeper from there, the natural cavern walls gave way to worked
     stone, worn and of an ancient vintage.
        -We even spotted recent footprints in the ancient dust and debris, of a size with the dwarven
         adventurers who set us down this trail.
    -The corridor terminated in a cave-in, with a small opening that someone flexible enough might
     be able to slip through.
        -This fit the description we were given, of the passage that forced the dwarven rogue to go
         it alone.
        -I thought I might be able to make it work, but wasn't keen on repeating that dwarf's
         mistake. The others were skeptical, and Nkondi wasn't able to get through after giving it
         a shot.
        -Jade confidently asserted that such construction usually includes escape tunnels and other
         back-up passages, for just such problems, and, tapping away at the filthy flagstone floor,
         she suggested we try digging downward.
        -Maya wasn't too keen on labor, and kept volunteering to "keep watch", but _did_ have a 
         pickaxe and shovel, which the rest of us took turns digging.
        -Breaking throught the flooring, we found that, indeed, there was a passage beneath us,
         which we climbed down into via a rope.
    -As we moved through this new passage, Maya reported further difficulties with her magics, and
     a test blast indeed looked a bit strange, feathering and forking as it flashed forward from her
     hands.
    -Nkongi, apparently lazy, asked if we could take a break and rest a while.
        -A bit of ribbing him ensued, but we did agree it would be best to be at our full strength
         before encountering the river ham.
        -The ship not being _that_ far, we indulged him, and opted to rest on the ship.
            -Anything in these chambers has already had ample time to prepare a defense already
             anyways
        -As we walked back through the caverns, a huge insect of some kind sprung up from the loose
         rubble at Sarge's feet, biting down on his arm.
        -Maya blasted it in response, and I stabbed it's brain with my brain.
        -That last pissed it _right_ off, and, tunneling into the loose debris of the tunnel floor,
         it burst up from beneath my feet, crushing me around the waist with one of it's enormous
         claws.
        -While I was shouting curses, my fellows battered away at it (thankfully missing me), and a
         spell from Sarge felled it before it could _completely_ crush the life out of me.
    -Well, _now_ I desperately wanted to rest a bit, and we hustled back through the remainder of
     the caverns, and flagged down Rusty aboard the ship.
        -A night's rest and all my healing belt's charges for the day had me right as rain, though!
        -Jade seemed to have a less restful night, though, looking a bit haggard around the mess
         table for breakfast. She mentioned a dream and insisted that, "We really need to go kill
         that fish thing now."
    -We then repeated the previous day's journey down deep, retracing our steps.
        -This time, the caverns were quiet, and we were soon back to our dig site.
        -The hole we left also seemed thankfully undisturbed.
    -Travelling through our uncovered passage, it led to a grate, opening onto some chamber
     above, from which a faint light eminated.
            -"A grate. . . Shit! We're in a sewer. Jade!" I yelled. "Escape passage my ass. . ."
        -Sarge melted the grate with an acidic spell, and we climbed up into some kind of
         half-ruined chamber.
        -The glow came from a hallway leading away from the grate, and we turned to walk in that
         direction.
        -As we did, though, Jade, in the rear, was swarmed by a squeaking mass of rats.
            -Rats with. . . transparent heads? We could see their _brains_.
        -I quickly found myself stunned by a wave of psychic turmoil from the swarm of rats, along
         with most of the rest of our party.
        -Sarge was still moving, though, and, barking a spell, blasted the rats with a flaming orb.
            -It's impact was very limited, though, knocking out only a rat or two.
        -Maya too tried to fight rats with fire, lighting a torch and hurling it at the swarm.
            -The rats seemed unafraid of the flames, though, and, what's more, moved with a sinister
             degree or intelligence and coordination.
        -All through that, the rats bit at Jade, beginning to devour the stunned artificer.
        -Mumbling an apology to Jade, Sarge produced a more effective _fan_ of flames, with another
         spell.
            -_That_ finally wiped out a huge swathe of the rats, though some still remained, and a
             badly burned Jade crumpled.
        -Maya then ran forward, pulling Jade out of the swarm of rats, and towards us.
        -Sarge and Maya then saw to healing Jade, while the rats unfortunately swarmed Maya.
        -The rats at least being on someone less critically injured now, Sarge against unleashed
         a wave of flames against them (and Maya).
        -Maya kept her feet and finished a remaining few rats with her sickle.
        -The rest of us eventually shook our heads a bit, and soon I was healing Maya with my Healing
         Belt while Sarge did the same for Jade.
    -The direction the rats came from was barred by a portculis, so we took the only other option,
     walking towards the light.
        -The light turned out to issue from a (seemingly everburning) torch, in a large room to the
         West.
        -On the floor of the room was a skeleton, it's skull run through by a rusted sword.
            -The skeleton was tall, dead, and looted. Eight feet, thoroughly, and thoroughly.
        -The everburning torch sat on a plinth, with two smaller ones surrounding it, bearing gems.
            -Examining the gems they each bore a logo, and the initials "MODD" in an ancient dialect of
             Common.
                -Maya mentioned something about the logo being associated with a manufacturer of
                 airship weapons.
            -Maya was surprisingly quick in collecting both the torch and the gems, for a noblewoman.
            -As she did so, she also started. Pawing at the wall, a twist of one stone revealed a
             hidden passage.
    -As the hidden passage opened, a torrent of noise was released, like rushing water.
        -Our arcanists both winced, and looked confused. They said that the corruption of their
         magics had escalated.
        -Nkondi also said that he detected an aberration ahead, suggesting it was the brain.
        -He and Sarge rushed forward, with the rest of us pausing only a moment before following (I
         to manifest a Force Screen).
        -The passage led to the largest chamber yet, through which flowed a glowing green river,
         perhaps comprised of magic itself.
        -I also felt a. . . tug, on all enchanted items I bore, towards the river. . .
        -Adding to the glow, all four corners of the room held pylons, shedding their own fluid
         green glow.
        -In the river, I could see clumps of seemingly floating stonework, and something that could
         indeed be described as ham-like, which quickly disappeared beneath the green fluid.
        -Jade stepped forward, readying her crossbow, and when the thing emerged again a moment
         later, she hit it with a crossbow bolt.
        -The ham-brain (it clearly appeared to be a brain, albeit a bit. . . pickled) manifested
         some kind of power but, well, I don't know psionics (I _am_ psionic), and didn't really
         pay much attention in class anyways.
        -Whatever it did, it then disappeared back beneath the rushing liquid.
        -Maya then pointed out a glowing glyph on the back wall of the chamber, across the torrent,
         and, shouting that, "We should destroy the glyph!" she rushed to the river's edge, near one
         of the pieces of floating stonework.
        -Nkondi then cast a spell of his own, and Jade, touched by the magic and suddenly quick as
		 a striking snake, launched another bolt into the liquid, at where the brain had submerged
		 itself.
        -Sarge, in front of me, was acting decidedly strange. He kept making as if to move, only the
         jerk back, as if warring with himself.
        -Remember the jailed dwarf's tale, I called out, "Sarge is acting strangely! Remember the
         dwarf's story, and beware mind control!"
        -I then darted back down the secret passage, ducking around a corner and hiding, my bow
         ready for the creature's return.
        -Peaking around the corner, I watched Maya leap, from bank to stone to bank, heading for the
         glyph.
        -Nkondi hurled a rock into the liquid, shouting that the brain was there.
        -_Something_ then won Sarge's internal war, and he unleashed a wave of flames at Jade's back.
            -Jade went down, charred, but that was only the beginning of our problems.
            -The spell appeared to go wrong, as the flames changed color and curled, seemingly
             burning away at reality itself.
            -The world around us. . . shifted, the river and chambers around us replaced with a
             slope covered in immaculately white snow.
                -Can Sarge even _do_ that? Or does this have something to do with the strangeness
                 of arcane magic here?
        -Well, the river-ham-brain now being out of sight. . . somewhere, it's river replaced by
         snow-covered stone, I elected to sneak up behind our enscrolled dragon-man, and shove him.
            -I did manage to creep up on him, but shoving with all the force I could muster barely
             rocked the formidable Sarge, who then turned towards me snarling.
        -Meanwhile, over his shoulder, I could see Maya blasting away at the glyph with her eldritch
         energies.
        -Then, also over his shoulder, I could see Nkondi rushing towards Sarge's turned back (copy
         cat. . .).
            -Taking my opportunity, I sidestepped, sticking my foot out in the process.
            -Nkondi shoved Sarge back down the hall, and my outstretched foot sent him sprawling.
        -There, on the ground, Sarge seemed to struggle more internally, blood now dripping from a
         nostril. Appearing to come to his senses for a moment, he took the hard core route out,
         raising his head, and then slamming it back down, face first, against the now-rocky floor,
         rendering himself unconscious.
        -I ducked behind one of the pylons, hiding and readying my bow for another shot.
        -Meanwhile, I could see Maya scraping away at the glyph with her sickle, finally earning a
         flash of light, as the glyph dissolved.
        -Bare moments later, a glowing humanoid appeared, radiant sigils circling her head.
        -"This area is being quarantined, on behalf of the church of Mystra. Leave at once!" the
         figure intoned.
            -She then began to mumble a bit, saying something about how, "Something must have gone
             wrong with the detection spells. . ."
            -Seeing Sarge unconscious on the ground, she tried again, "_Can_ you leave the area?"
             "Uh, well," I responded, "He's enscrolled by the beast that was living in this torrent
              of magic. I think it's still here somewhere. . . "
             "Ah. I may be able to do something about that," she replied.
            -Striding over to Sarge, she bent down and lifted his head, examining his eyes. Nodding,
             she barked a few arcane syllables, and then pronounced the curse lifted. "Can you now
             wake him?" she asked.
            -Maya with a glint in her eye, responded, "Well, we've run through all our potions. . ."
                -I chose not to bring up the contents of my backback.
            -Sighing, she pulled out a round of potions, handing one to each of us, telling us they
             were of Cure Serious wounds.
            -Pouring one down Sarge's throat soon had him back on his feet, and apparently possessed
             of his own will again.
            -"Now, will you please get out of here?" she asked.
             ". . . well," Maya replied, "It took us quite a lot to get here. To leave empty handed,
              it would devestate us. . ."
             "Yeah," I joined in, "and we _did_ do you a favor here. This mess apparently escaped
              your notice until Maya scraped that glyph off the wall. . . We've all done a lot of
              good here, and could easily all walk away happy."
             "Fifty thousand gold worth of rubies should do it," Nkondi suggested, finishing the
              routine.
             "_Fifty thousand_?!?" she sputtered, "That's too much!"
             "Well, you said you followed Mystra?" I asked, looking to compromise. "What of magic?
              Not all rewards gleam, and you follow the goddess of the arcane. . ."
             ". . . fine. My offer is twelve thousand. And, as to magic, here. . ." Incanting a few
             syllables and waving her arms, magical energies flowed out from the woman, reaching out
             to each of us. "There," she said, "Each of you has now been granted Darkvision."
             "Uh, wow! Yeah, that'll do!" I replied.
            -Nkondi was less satisfied, though. "What of me?" he asked. "I could already see in the
             dark!"
             "That's. . ." she began.
             "You owe me," he interrupted. "A favor then? To be named later?"
             ". . . A small one," she finished, eliciting a nod from Nkondi.
            -Turning to the rest of us again, she said, "Here. Take this," tossing a small stone to
             Maya. "Despite being. . . demanding, you've were able to make it here. Our church has
             uses for those with your skills of infiltration. With that marked stone, I can contact
             you again, if we have need of your services. . . Now, please, leave this place."
             "It's been a pleasure doing business with you!" I replied.
			-"Watch out for floating brains!" I called out over my shoulder, as we turned and walked
			 back out of the passageway.


TODO:
    -(Done!) Darkvision! Record it somewhere, ask about range, whether it's a permanent spell, etc.
        -Probably removes the temptation to take a second level of Shadowdancer.


10/5/22:
	-Whatever happened to import some snow, it also disappeared a good chunk of the caves and earth
	 around us, leaving the area we were in open to the sky.
		-Well, time to signal Rusty!
		-Nkondi magicked up some kind of buzzard, and delivered Rusty a note.
		-While the Chosen of Mystra examined the area and inscribed various runes on things, Rusty
		 brought the airship in low and lowered some rope ladders.
	-Once back aboard the airship, we discussed where we'd go next. Maya still had the business of
	 the signet rings in Sharaar Kol, so we took the ship back up and headed again in the direction
	 of the dwarven city.
	-It was a couple days' flight back, and we arrived at the city's air port mid-morning.
	-Soon, we were back down to the trade city, shopping and drinking.
		-First step was to unload these gems. They seemed like they were worth a decent chunk of
		 change, but probably more for their historical significance, necessitating a particular
		 buyer.
		-I wasn't sure where to go, but Maya claimed to know of a local scholar, a student of
		 history, but one who resides in Sharaar Kol's _lower_ city.
		-So, we walked up to the passage to the lower city, and asked it's guards.
		-They told us outsiders could gain access by visiting the customs house, a short walk away.
		-Thanking them, that's just where we went.
			-There, to access the lower city, we were made to swear three oaths on various sacred
			 objects in the office, promising to do no violence but in self-defense, to obey the
			 king and leave when asked, and to not steal during our visit.
			-As I swore each oath, I could feel magic washing over me. Clearly there was some. . .
			 enforcement, behind these oaths.
			-After swearing, and a lot of paperwork, we were each given a green, glowing badge to
			 wear, one which we were told would last a week, and need to be renewed thereafter.
			-Thanking the customs agent, we then headed into the lower city.
	-The lower city proved to be dominated by a massive, mechanized forge.
		-Maya, meanwhile, proved to not know where we were going, but at least knew a name.
		-So, we asked around the lower city, and soon got directions to our scholar.
		-Entering his shop, we could see we came to the right place. Maya pointed at some diagrams
		 and a strange, brass device on display, which bore a similar logo to the gem.
		-The proprietor proved a bit cantankerous, but we were able to talk him into a paying a
		 premium for the gems, 550 gold apiece.
		-We did that in part by raising the prospect of future expeditions that he'd be "funding",
		 potentially uncovering more such, if the matter proved lucrative. . .
			-He seemed somewhat receptive to the idea.
		-Maya also took a moment to speak to the man about counterfeiters, seeking a lead on her
		 rings.
			-That bore some fruit, with him mentioning a group, the "Quick Hammers", who'd been
			 accused of. . . mislabeling, in the past.
		-We also took the opportunity to pawn that everburning torch off on the guy for more than
		 it's worth, playing up it's "historical significance" as well.
	-Walking out of the shop, I was in a great mood, running gold through my hands.
		-"Well, we made out quite well!" I said. "Here's your shares folks. . . Wait, where's
		  Nkondi?"
		-He was nowhere to be found. Ominously, though, there were a lot of guards moving around
		 with some haste on the streets.
		-Uh oh. I questioned whether we should run towards or away from this trouble, but most of
		 the others didn't want Nkondi out of sight too long.
		-Asking around didn't reassure me. Apparently some "pale, babbling man" had taken someone
		 hostage. . .
		-Hmm. . . now I was definitely leaning towards running in the opposite direction, or at
		 least exercising some discretion. In fact, we could go hole up in a bar! _Real_ discreet.
		-Sarge took that and ran with it, saying, "Yeah. . . we could find a cop bar, see if we
		 hear anything about what's going on. . ."
		 "Uh, yeah! Exactly what I was getting at. . ."
		-I then sought out a relatively idle guard, asking him for a bar recommendation, whatever
		 _he_ likes. . .
		-The guard steered us to a place called "The Plane Tankard", apparently specializing in
		 exotic ales.
		-Thanking him and heading there, my ruse paid off: the place was indeed full of off-duty
		 guards.
		-I asked the barkeep there for a recommendation, winding up with a round of some vile
		 Abyssal ale, albeit one that turned our eyes a pleasing shade of fiery red.
		-I set into drinking, and Maya got herself set up to perform in the tavern, talking with
		 the barkeep, and then telling a story, with accompaniment, for the tavern's patrons.
			-Some historical tale, touching on Sharaar Kol, it seemed to get a welcome reception.
			-Afterwards, she'd won several dwarven admirers. She spent some time talking with them,
			 then came back with news.
			-She'd learned that there were rumors among the guards that these Quick Hammers had
			 bribed the guard captain, which is why they remain in operation.
			-Perhaps we could look into this, discover some proof, and rob the miscreants of their
			 patronage and protection.
			-She'd also heard that the king can free us from the oaths required to get us to the
			 lower city, if he could be convinced to support the investigation.
		-Before we could take that idea much further, though, a guard rushed in, calling up the
		 off-duty guards, for some emergency. "He cut off his ear!" the frantic guard shouted.
			-'Dric's crystal cock! This was turning into a mess. I wanted out of the splash zone.
		-Well, we (unwisely) followed the guards, who rushed to a scrum of their fellows gathered
		 in the temple district.
			-From their shouted orders, translated and summarized Maya and Jade, Nkondi had taken
			 a high priest of Moradin hostage, demanding the priest's weight in platinum in return,
			 because. . . the city is corrupt or something?
			-Yep, sounds like Nkondi.
		-So we sought out where the kidnapping was said to have taken place, hoping to track down
		 Nkondi (his ransom demands coming via notes discovered only after he'd gone).
			-Soon, we were following foot prints that suddenly ended, and looking about at nearby
			 magical auras.
			-Jade pronounced that there was a faint necromantic aura in the area, something she
			 claimed was residue from the "Sunstroke" spell. From her description of how it
			 "dehydrates" it's victims, that does sound like Nkondi.
			-"And a transmutation one!" Maya chimed in. "Traces of something related to
			  concealment. . ."
			-Following some traces of the latter, we wound up a tunnel into the rock of the
			 mountain, apparently a circuitous route up towards the airship docks. . .
			-Shit. Pale motherfucker better not steal my boat. . .
		-Rushing up to the airship docks, we found several guards strewn about, passed out, and
		 I began to run for my ship.
			-I did a quick look around the ship, though, didn't turn up Nkondi. "What about those
			 of you who can see magic?" I asked. "Anything?"
			-Maya and Jade just continued carefully inspecting the ship and it's contents.
			-Eventually, Maya called my name, across the deck from me.
			 "Yes? Find something?"
			 "I found Nkondi."
			 "What?!? Where?"
			-Nkondi then stood up from a barrel near Maya, saying, "Good. You're here. Tell me, how
			  much do you think _this_ one is worth?" as he gestured to Maya.
			-". . . about 1,000 platinum, if I had to guess. . ." I looked rather thoughtful. Still,
			 I said, "It was rather bad form pulling something like this. . . without talking to the
			  Captain."
			 "If I'd asked, you would have said no. Now, you're already accomplices, and _have_ to
			  join me in this."
			-I didn't respond. . . verbally. Instead, an audible hum began to grow around me, but
			 Nkondi appeared to shake off my attempt to crush his mind. "I've had _enough_ of being
			  told what to do!" I shouted.
			-My other companions quickly joined me in the attack.
			-Nkondi, for his part, tried to grab at Maya's sickle, but she shoved him and he went
			 sprawling.
			-I loosed shots at Nkondi as I dove for cover. Taking a quick breather behind it,
			 though, I noticed I could hear an irregular. . . clicking, coming from below decks.
			-The source was quickly revealed as a 7' tall knife-wielding insect lept out from the
			 deck's hatch, and began to furiously slash Nkondi to pieces.
				-Well, huh.
			-I was still hidden, and figured I'd give some thought to the situation while I could.
			-Peeking out, the insect stood there, chittering arythmically, in what might be a
			 language. In a moment, though, it began to dig through the Nkondi chunks, shaking them
			 free from Nkondi's clothes and other belongings.
			-It then looked up at those visible, and divied those belongings up into five piles.
			-Seeing those signs of commerce, I emerged from hiding and strolled towards the
			 creature. Looks like I can work with this. . .
			-As I approached, though, the bug whirled to face me and rushed over. . . sniffing at
			 me?
			-"Well, hello! Thanks for the help, there! Now, what are you and what are you doing on
			  my ship?"
			 "You queen?" the thing responded.
			 "Ah, well, I do like to think that I've got a rather regal bearing, yes. But, no one
			  has ever named me 'queen'."
			 "This is your hive?"
			 "Oh! I think I see what you mean. Yeah, this is my ship."
			 "You are queen. I join you?"
			 "Well, you _did_ just create an opening _and_ prove your worth while doing it. I
			  wouldn't mind having something like yourself between me and the enemy. . ."
			 "Yes. Protect queen."
			 "OK, yeah, I can work with this. . ."
			 "To-Cao", it said, pointing to itself.
			 "Fred the Red!" I said, bowing. "A pleasure!"
			-While I was having the heart to heart, though, dwarven guards were rushing across the
			 docks, towards are ship.
				-Running up the gangplank, they took in the sight of Sarge, who had walked over to
				 the priest and was tending to his injuries, while I pointed at the pile of Nkondi-
				 chunks, saying, "There's your perpetrator. . ."
				-They of course had questions for us.
					-We explained that, hearing of the kidnapping and the description of it's
					 culprit, we suspected our "deckhand", and, fearing it's theft, rushed to our
					 ship.
				-They were pretty willing to accept our answers, and we soon saw why, as they
				 ushered forward another priest, to question Nkondi's corpse, via a spell.
					-His answers, truth likely compelled of his spirit, quite nicely exonerated us.
				-Still, they insisted we come back to their guardpost, to answer a few more
				 questions, eliciting mostly compliant shrugs from the lot of us.
				-"Is the, uh, big cricket with you?" one of the guards asked.
				 "He's a. . . new acquaintance," I said, "But he witnessed the end of things. Bring
				  him along."
					-If To-Cao is as good as his word, good to have him watching my back, there.
			-Following them back to their guard post, where they had us swear yet another oath, this
			 time one to speak truly.
				-We agreed, but what followed was a series of careful evasions, mostly on Maya's and
				 my parts, in which we successfully cast Nkondi as a barely known deckhand, and
				 ourselves as upstanding traders who had _nothing_ to do with the recent troubles in
				 our last port of Sasserine.
	-Walking out of the guard post, I turned to the others and said, "Well! That went about as well
	  as could be expected! As our next order of business, I guess we have more loot to attend to!
	  Then, some spending money in hand, well. . . I'm not sure, is a funeral or celebration to
	  called for?"
		-I imagine the answering silence was them stunned by my brilliant leadership in these trying
		 times.


TODO:
	-Do some shopping during downtime!
		-(DONE!) Get the buckler.
			-Got a _+1_ buckler approved. Spend the gold and apply it!


10/19/22:
	-We decided to spend a few days hanging around town.
		-Maya also suggested some relaxation might be prudent. . . spacing out our exploits a bit,
		 lest we get run out of _another_ city.
		-Jade wanted to do some magic crafting, and requested some inpiration and oversight from
		 the captain, charming muse that I am.
			-To-Cao and I accompanied Jade on a supply run, to pick up more magic reagents.
			-While we were out, Jade suddenly paused in a square, staring off into space.
			-She's _normally_ pretty spacey, but this was a bit much, even for her.
			-"Jade? What's going on?" I asked.
			 "Someone is. . . sending me a message," she responded.
			 "Huh? Oh, some kind of magic?"
			 She nodded, and said, "I'm not sure who's sending it, though."
			 "Well, can't you see magic? With that monocle or something?"
			 "Oh! Yeah, here. . ."
			-She then set about looking around with her monocole, eventually pointing down one of
			 the streets.
			 "Lead the way, Jade!" I said.
			-Following her, she led us to a stone apartment building. Trying it, though, the door
			 was locked.
			-"I can help with this," To-Cao volunteered. "I will grab you two and jump up."
			 "Uh. . ." Jade responded, "Do you maybe have some rope or something like that instead?"
			-To-Cao nodded curtly, and drew out a coil from his pack. Stepping back a bit, he took
			 a running leap up onto the side of the building, hanging from a window ledge with his
			 claws.
			-That was rapidly beginning to attract some attention from passerby, though, so I
			 stepped in. Addressing those who'd stopped and begun to whisper, I said, "Hi folks!
			 Nothing to worry about here! This is the trial run of our window cleaning service!"
			-I sold it pretty well, and soon they were nodding and murmering about how, "Oh! Yeah,
			 the windows down here _do_ get filthy. All that gray soot from the forge! How much are
			 you guys charging?"
			-Soon, the onlookers were wandering off, with a few agreeing to leave word at the inn
			 we'd stayed at, to hire us once we're fully open for business. . .
			-As that calmed down, I turned to Jade and asked, "So, where _exactly_ was that magic
			 coming from again.
			-She pointed to a window on the fifth floor, and I relayed to same to our resident
			 mantis man, saying, "To-Cao! That's the customer's window over there!"
			-To-Cao attempted to leap from his perch to that window, but missed, and fell to the
			 cobbles below.
			-I and several onlookers rushed over to him, and I reassured them that we had healing
			 magic for just such accidents. Soon, with my healing belt, I had him back on his. . .
			 legs, I guess?
			-He then made several more attempts, each similarly unsuccessful despite his nimbleness,
			 though thankfully less injurious. Inscrutable though the insect is, it was still quite
			 clear that he was growing _very_ frustrated.
			-While that was all going on, _I_ began to hear. . . whispers. Presumably whatever
			 spell Jade had heard. We had a conversation: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/1032450956966764586
				DMJake — Today at 7:31 PM
				Your friend doesn't listen very well
				maybe you will be more reasonable
				I've seen evidence that your group can do things, maybe messy, but useful
				Peaked — Today at 7:36 PM
				We're indeed quite capable. New business, though, goes through me. What have you got in mind?
				DMJake — Today at 7:37 PM
				Your friend makes me magic items, I pay him. Maybe I make friends with some politicians in Sasserine?
				It would be a shame if something were to happen to that ship of yours
				I don't want that to happen
				Peaked — Today at 7:39 PM
				(No further response from me, I think.)
			-While I grappled with that, someone had shut from within the window To-Cao had been
			 aiming for.
			-He wasn't going to let that stop him and, finally making his second jump successfully,
			 he crashed through the glass, to the sound of shouting from inside the window.
			-That shouting quickly escalated to a dwarf leaning out the window, yelling "Guards!
			 Guards!"
			-A group of heavily armored guards was soon shoving its way through the crowd and
			 towards the building, while I and Jade sauntered off, in the other direction, whistling.
			-To-Cao soon emerged from the buidings door, where he was apprehended by the guards.
			-After a brief discussion, they led him away, down the street and towards both us and
			 a nearby guard post.
			-As they walked past us, To-Cao locked eyes with me, and began to chitter.
			-Seeing this, the guards all turned to look at me as well. . .
			-Well, so much for evading notice. "Oh! Are you taking him to the hospital?" I asked them.
			 "Queen?" To-Cao asked me.
			 "Are you who he's talking about?" a guard then asked too.
			 "Yeah, yeah, he works for me. We were rushing to get him some help! After the accident!"
			 "The accident? This creature was caught breaking into a home!" the guard said.
			 "Oh! No, this is all a big misunderstanding," I bluffed. "We're _window washers_. He
			  was setting up our rigging when he slipped, and crashed through the window! We ran
			  off in search of a priest! Though, To-Cao, looking at you, you're in pretty good shape
			  for all that glass! Some perks to that carapace, huh?"
			-The guard then interrupted my rambling, saying, "Well, whatever you were doing here,
			 he's going to have to come to the station. We'll discuss the matter further, there. . ."
			 "Sure, sure," I said. "I'll come with. Jade, go let the rest of. . . the company know
			  what happened."
			 She nodded in response, and left.
			-They led us over to a guard post, where the ranking officer on duty recognized us,
			 saying, "Wait, that's the creature that was involved in the high priest's kidnapping!"
			 "The creature that _saved_ the high priest," I clarified.
			 "Well, hmph, I guess we'll see about that, now that he's breaking into buildings!"
			 "Breaking in?!?" I protested. "We were washing windows! I was helping to set him up
			  with gainful employment, utilizing his. . . unique talents. There was an accident,
			  though. . ."
			-I argued a while further with the guards, who wanted us to remain here while they
			 fetched the building's owner and got statemens, insisting also that To-Cao stay in one
			 of the cells.
			-While I waited there, pondering my next move, I began to receive some more magic
			 messages: https://discord.com/channels/@me/560920165383143425/1032458001254195261
				DMJake — Today at 7:59 PM
				You get a new whisper in your head, you know the guard captain is a friend
				Peaked — Today at 8:06 PM
				I do like working with friends! You've rather started things off on the wrong foot, though, making threats. Fortunately, here's your opportunity for a showing of good faith. . .
				DMJake — Today at 8:08 PM
				I don't like to make threats, but you got so aggressive. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
				Peaked — Today at 8:10 PM
				You don't, and can't. Hence the need for "good faith". Business requires a degree of trust, after all. (Diplomacy check?)
				DMJake — Today at 8:10 PM
				yup
				Peaked — Today at 8:10 PM
				33
				DMJake — Today at 8:11 PM
				Fair enough, your friend will be free within the hour
			-The voice in my head was a good as it's word, and the guards soon released To-Cao from
			 his cell and us from the station, after collecting a fee for the damages.
				-"You're going to be paying _at least_ half of this," I grumbled to To-Cao.
			-The rest of the crew met us outside the guard post, having apparently come to offer us
			 aid.
			-"The matter is resolved for now," I said, "But Jade never did get her materials. How
			  about you two, Maya and Sarge, accompany her to the store, while I take To-Cao back
			  to the ship. . . check in on Rusty and all. . ."
			 "Uh, sure, we can do that," Maya replied, "But there was another matter we wanted to
			  talk to you about, Fred. I was hoping you could help me in looking further into this
			  'Quick Hammers' matter, to find where they meet."
			 "I've got some thoughts on that, actually. We can talk more back on the ship."
	-Back at the ship, we discussed the matter of the "Quick Hammers", and I revealed to the
	 rest that they'd contacted _me_ after Jade.
		-They were up for at least attending the meeting, and as sure as I was that our mystery
		 messenger was associated with the gang.
		-We then fell to discussing the plan, but unfortunately didn't come up with anything
		 revelatory, ultimately deciding we make the meeting and figure it out from there.
	-Roughly three hours later, we were again winding our way back down the stair that led to the
	 lower city, to meet our mystery contact.
		-Passing through the city, we were definitely getting glances from the guards now.
		-Eventually, we reached the meeting point, though, a largely deserted side street.
		-We were soon greeted by two armed and armored dwarves, one of whom called out to us saying,
		 "Here to do business?"
		 "We're always interested in new business, my crew and I," I replied.
		-We engaged in some banter about trust, business, and friendship, and Maya eventually asked
		 of them an introduction, since they clearly knew us.
		 "This is Vulkan Mornhammer," replied the dwarf that had been speaking, "And I am Dandruk
		  Quickhammer."
		-We then discussed the business at hand. 
			-Dandruk spoke of how much he valued. . . freedom. Freedom from regulations, and from
			 the cut that those in power demand.
			-He also spoke of craftsmanship, and wanted some proof of Jade's. I offered up my
			 inherited healing belt for inspection, pointing out the fine filigree of it's buckle,
			 but he had something more specific in mind. He suggested a trial, an enchanted silver
			 raven figurine he wanted Jade to make.
			-I handled negotiations (flawlessly, of course), and got the money and soul-stuff
			 required for the item up front, plus an additional 10% gold, "for the lady's time."
			-He agreed rather easily, suggesting both that I'm great at this and that they're very
			 interested in whatever they ultimately want from Jade.
		-I then raised the matter of reaching back out to them, and how we should go about it.
			-He replied that we could meet back here, and asked Jade how long the crafting would
			 take. She said it would be six days, so in six days he said we could meet again.
		-They then turned to leave, and so did we.
	-Back at the ship again, we discussed how that went, and our next move.
		-Seemed pretty good to me, and we now had _lots_ more time to figure out our next move
		 with these folks. Continued business with them also means more opportunities to learn
		 more, and more trust.
	-Jade needed my help and coaching to make the items, so, while she worked on that, Maya
	 went out into the city, to further investigate the Quickhammers, now that we had some names.
		-Coming back to the ship after the first day of that, she told us of what she'd learned.
		-Rumor was, the group was looking to expand to Sasserine, to fill the vacuum left after
		 the Lotus Dragons stopped operating. In service of that, they were stockpiling weapons,
		 particularly silver, and money, as well as hiring people for the expansion.
		-She also got the impression that their numbers in Sharaar Kol were roughly fifteen,
		 currently.
		-Maya also raised another thing she'd like to accomplish while Jade worked: getting a
		 message to her family about what she'd learned thus far.
			-Well, Jade can work on a moving ship, and we have just a bit more time than we'd need
			 to get to Sasserine and back.
			-I wasn't sure that any of the rest of us would be welcome in the city, though, but
			 Maya said we could simply put her in a jolly boat some distance outside the city,
			 and let her row ashore.
				-Sarge also may be able to accompany her, as he rightly claimed he wasn't involved
				 in the famous funeral riot.
				-He and Maya were going to discuss the plan as we traveled to the city.


11/2/22:
	-The night we reached Sasserine, we stopped well outside of the city's lagoon, and lowered a
	 jolly boat from the airship, containing Maya and Sarge.
	-Meanwhile, I spent the next day or so heckling Jade as she worked, drinking steadily as I did
	 so.
	-So it was with a hangover I awoke the next morning, to strange voices coming from on deck.
		-Climbing a ladder, I emerged into the sun, blinking, to see Maya, Sarge, and two elves
		 unknown to me.
		-Seeing me, Maya greeted me and introduced me to her lord father and a wizard in service
		 to her house.
		-They were obviously very concerned with Maya's safety, but she was also obviously sticking
		 with us. Her father gave me the 3rd degree, asking about the ship's history, and. . .
		 losses the crew had endured.
			-I hemmed and hawed my way around that last, pointing out that, "No blood has ever been
			 shed aboard this ship, save for that incident with Nkondi. . ."
		-The wizard had questions about the ship, which I took as an excuse for a tour, where I
		 talked his pointy ears off, about the conjured materials and the excellent workmanship
		 characteristic of the products of Edric's domains.
			-The mention of Ed caught his attention. "Oh?" he asked, "You're backed by The
			  Brotherhood?"
			 "You might call them the ship's patrons. . ."
			 "Ah. That'd explain the necromancy, then, if you're tied to the church of Nkisi."
			 "Yeah," I confessed, "It's not totally foriegn to me, but something seems rotton in
			  th church of Nkisi lately. . ."
		-He'd obviously heard something about the mess with Nkondi, and it soon became obvious that
		 Maya had put much of the blame for the Sasserine mess on him. The lord even mentioned
		 she'd claimed he'd enscrolled us, causing much of the trouble.
		-Eventually (more or less) satisfied with his daughter's safety and my "no more necromancers"
		 policy, he drew forth from his pocket a small journal, handing it to me, saying, "This
		  journal is linked to one in my possession. What you write here will be shown to me, across
		  any distance. Keep me apprised as to my daughter's whereabouts."
		 "Oh! A handy thing!" I said. "Maya, I imagined you'd like to keep this in your possession?"
		-That evoked a cold stare from Lord Dracus, and Maya said, "I believe he does indeed mean
		 for _you_ to have it."
		 "Oh. Well, OK!"
		-He then asked that we continue to help with the gang situation, in Sasserine and with the
		 Quickhammers.
			-"We're already in contact with Quickhammers!" I volunteered. "But, what _does_ your
			  house want to do with them?"
			 "Take down their base of operations," he said, "I do not know that _death_ is
			  appropriate. . ."
			 "They've already threatened us with violence," I responded. "I wouldn't imagine this
			  can resolved _without_ further blood. . ."
			-He looked grim, but did not respond to that.
			-"Father," Maya broke in, "Further service should come with some pay. . ."
			 "Of course," he replied, and they fell to discussing what would be customary.
			-After a quick moment, he accepted Maya's suggestion and offered us 1,000 platinum in
			 exchange for our help, a deal I happily accepted.
			-He took a moment to emphasize again that this is a grave matter, and alluded also to a
			 vision Maya had, of some impending doom.
				-"Maya? This is the first I've heard of this?" I asked.
				 "It was last night. We'll talk later."
				 "Very well. . ."
		-After goodbye to his daughter, he and the wizard teleported away.
	-After their departure, Maya filled me in on further details.
		-Beyond the job, Maya had asked her father to help clear our name, laying all the blame for
		 the funeral and on at the feet of Nkondi and "his enchantments."
		-She also filled us in on the vision, which featured tentacles emerging from the water to
		 destroy Sasserine, a great black dragon, and demons.
			-Yep, that's an apocalypse vision alright. . .
		-Finally, Maya updated us on the state of Sasserine, saying that the battle for control of
		 the city's underworld continued and that there was fighting every night in the city.
	-With The Quickhammers our target, we brought the ship about and headed back to Sharaar Kol,
	 discussing during the trip our plan.
		-Maya pointed out that we do have a meeting scheduled, one at which we could perhaps ask to
		 meet with the leaders?
		-"Stand on principle, eh?" I said. "Insist we want to meet who we're doing business with?
		  Not a bad idea. . . We could also play along until hopefully invited to do the same, or
		  offer the ship's service carrying cargo and count on that meaning we need to pick it up
		  from some substantial site under their control?"
		-That all elicited a fair amount of nodding, so I continued, saying, "Well, that's at least
		  several options. We can meet with them and then see what we can make work. Anything else
		  anyone would like to prep for that?"
		 "I would also like talk with high priest we saved," Maya said. "Check on how he's doing
		  after the ordeal, and maybe enlist his aid in our quest."
		 "Good idea!" I replied, "The Quickhammers have a guard captain on their side. Some official
		  backing of our own might stave off some future trouble."
	-On the way back, though, a day or so into the journey, the wind began to pick up.
		-Shouting orders from the ships wheel, we reefed the ship's sails.
			-We struggled with one rope in the process, but To-Cao was able to add his formidable
			 strength to that of Rusty and they pulled it taught and brought the sail in.
		-We'd barely breathed sighs of relief when a shout of alarm went up from Rusty.
		-Off the ship's rail, a short distance from him, was a small whirlwind diving seemingly
		 purposefully at the nearby crew.
		-Recognizing something was amiss, I engaged my precognitive insight, which was quickly
		 justified as the whirlwind swept Sarge off the deck and over the side.
			-As it did so, it shouted in Auran, "Free the little ones!"
			-Well, I'm not doing _that_. . .
		-Fortunately, it chose the only one of us with wings, and he was able to glide back over
		 the deck, coming in for an only slightly rough landing.
		-Maya and To-Cao took their revenge on the thing, though, Maya blasting it with fiery energy
		 that set it alight and To-Cao rushing to the rail and hurling something at it.
		-Jade followed that with an arrow. It was less than clear if anything but the fire had
		 harmed it but I shrugged and added an arrow of my own. Amazing as I am, that ended the
		 silly wind, the whirl dissipating and the debris caught in it dropping from the sky.
		-Jade asked why such a thing would attack us. I danced around the issue a bit, but Jade
		 pushed, and I admitted, "Well, you do know this ship runs on bound air elementals, right?"
		 "Oh. Well, yeah, that makes sense."
	-Arriving back at Sharaar Kol, we made our way down to the lower city.
		-We were hassled a bit by the guard, given recent events, but he let _most_ of us down.
			-To-Cao he refused, pointing to the bug's badge, glowing red. "He broke his oath," the
			 guard said, "And won't be allowed to return."
			 "Ah, very well," I said. "To-Cao, you're on duty guarding the ship."
			 His response was some very dejected clicking, but he complied.
		-Once within, we headed straight to the temple, easily identified by it's enormous statue
		 of Moradin.
			-We were stopped by guards at it's doors, saying, "Halt! We've had to increase security,
			  after the recent. . . incident."
			 "Oh, we understand!" I said. "That's actually why we're here. We bore witness to a part
			  of the priest's ordeal, and brought an end to it. We wanted to check in on him, and
			  offer our sympathies!"
			 "Hmph. Well, let me check with the priests. . ."
			-The guard returned a moment later, and admitted us.
			-Within, we met with the priest, who admitted no harm from the ordeal, his faith in
			 Moradin's plan for him being apparently unshakeable.
			-I offered him our sympathies nonetheless.
			-He did ask after To-Cao, "the one who saved me". Maya explained that he'd, "in the
			 course of helping you", broken one of the vows he'd made to enter the city. "Would
			  you be able to help him with that?" she asked the priest.
			 "I suppose I could put in a good word for him. . . if an appropriate donation were
			  made."
			 "Alas," I broke in, "Though To-Cao's people are formidable, they are not wealthy.
			  Perhaps he could atone. . . through service?"
			 "Service? Well. . . yes, that would be. . . appropriate. There is a crew of miners,
			  looking to venture deep into a dangerous section of the mines. They could use
			  guards. . ."
			 "Ah!" I said, "That's definitely within To-Cao's skills, as you've seen."
			 "They mean to leave three days from now. I will make the arrangements, and you shall
			  meet them at first light at the entrance to the mines. Beware, for the drow are 
			  known to haunt that area. . ."
			 "Great!"
			-Maya also took the opportunity to ask him of The Quickhammers.
				-The church apparently looks down on their shoddy workmanship as much as the rest
				 of the city, but added that, "It's not exactly a _crime_. Though, if the rumors
				  are true, there's more to them then just that. . . But, the guards seem to look
				  the other way and the king is pulled in so many directions at once. . ."
				 "Oh!" Maya said suddenly. "Would it be possible to get an audience with the king?
				  I am a scion of House Dracus of Sasserine, here representing my house. . ."
				 "Oh? Before my ordeal, I would have said it was impossible. . . But, since, I seem
				  to have the king's ear whenever I want it."
				 "Would you be able to help me, then?" Maya asked.
				 "Well, the king is in the mines at the moment, surveying the works, but, when he
				  returns this evening, I suppose I could let him know you're here."
				 "That would be great!" I broke in. "You have our thanks!"
				 "And you the blessing of Moradin, my son."
			-We then took our leave of the priest and his temple.
		-Next, Maya wished to pursue some research concerning her vision, and to visit the scholar
		 of her acquaintance, here in the lower city.
			-While she busied herself with that, I busied myself at the bar.


11/30/22:
	-At the bar, I tried to learn a dwarven dance routine, but I wasn't feeling it, probably due to
	 not understanding a word of what they were chanting (in Dwarvish).
		-It entailed sliding your feet along the floor, boots never leaving it.
		-"Do you, uh, grease your shoes for that?"
		 "Ha! No lad! It's about _feeling_ your connection to the earth. Comes natural to us dwarves."
	-I did make a friend, though, sitting down to some whiskey with the dwarf who was coaching me
	 through the dance, who turned out to be a miner (what a surprise, for a dwarf. . .).
		-He asked me what I was in town for, and I told him about the job the high priest had
		 arranged for us.
		-"In fact," I added, "What sort of dangers are there, down in the mines?"
		 "Well, certainly have to keep an ear out for cave-ins, like anywhere else under the earth.
		  Beyond that, though, miners have come back. . . wrong."
		 "Oh! Yeah, we know a thing or two about that. Dealt with some kind of river brain. Or was
		  it a river ham? Eh, whatever. You see some kind of meat rising from a river, you run."
		 "Oh, aye?" the dwarf replied. "I'll have to keep that in mind. . . Well, other than that,
		  there are of course the drow, in the deep mines."
		 "Yeah, we heard something about that. . . Elves above and elves below, huh?"
		 "Aye, aye. I prefer the ones above, though, what little that's worth."
		 "Yeah. Their booze is better. Or at least not poisoned."
	-After that chat, he convinced me to give the dance another shot.
		-No shoe grease, but I myself was a bit better lubricated, and made a good showing of it.
		-Finally learning the routine, it's got a practical application: I can now make a DC 25
		 Perform(Dance) check to negate 10 ft. of rough terrain underground.
	-Eventually, Maya and Sarge joined us at the bar.
		-Maya, having evidently overheard our conversation about elves, began stroking an invisible
		 beard and talking to the dwarf in his native tongue.
		-She even challenged the dwarf to arm wrestling, a narrow contest in which she eventually
		 prevailed.
		-She also took a turn at dancing, picking up the routine too, and performing it almost as
		 well as me.
			-Surely thanks to my shouted encouragement!
	-As she sat back down, I asked Maya how her research went.
	 "Well, I read a book and it cursed me. I got better, though."
	 "Huh. See! That's what reading too much gets you. . ."
	-After "lunch" at the bar, I was feeling rather tired, so we headed back to the ship.
		-I don't think the pemmican ever tasted quite so good, and I downed quite a bit of it while
		 a relieved-to-see-me To-Cao picked bits of debris out of my hair, and soon turned in.
	-We spent the next several days bumming around town, sampling the entertainments of the dwarves.
		-In the course of that, we heard rumor of another stranger in town, an oddly dressed human
		 who would neither confirm nor deny that he was a wizard, but who kept asking odd questions
		 of the city's scholars. Questions that sounded oddly similar to Maya's research. . .
	-When it came time, we met the crew of dwarven miners at the entrance to the mines.
		-Or, at least most of us did. Jade remained back at the ship to continue her work for the
		 Quickhammers.
		-There were six of them, led by a foreman named Grognok.
		-Following their instructions, we descended into the mines.
	-Worked stone and arched supports soon gave way to rough hewn walls and natural caves.
	-Emerging into one such cave, we were suddenly swarmed by enormous bats.
		-Near the size of ponies, one swooped at me. I took a shot at it as it did, but the shot
		 went wide and it sank it's fangs into my shoulder.
		-An enraged To-Cao lept at it, slashing frantically with at it with his kukris, while I
		 wisely fell back to employ my healing belt.
		-Sarge roasted the winged bastard with a gout of flame from his claws, finishing it off and
		 scorching several of it's fellows in the process.
		-Maya joined in with that, projecting crackling blasts of her own eldritch energies at the
		 bats while To-Cao lept at another one.
		-The battle continued for some time, with the bats dropping like flies. Well, pony-sized,
		 leather-winged flies.
			-Many of them on fire too, with Sarge adding some alchemist's fire to his spells too.
				-"I didn't know you had hot sauce, Sarge!" I shouted. "You've been holding out on
				  me! These trail rations are dry as fuck!"
		-One of them bit To-Cao, though, shaking him until he fell to the ground, and Maya rushed
		 in heroically, dragging him out of the fray.
		-That gave Sarge a clear shot, and he torched the remaining bats with more conjured flames.
	-All of us spent some time (and potions) healing, and soon To-Cao was back on his feet and we
	 were ready to move on.
	-A short while later, we crossed a crevasse, with the aid of a board the dwarves had brought,
	 and entered a cave.
		-Grognok turned to us and issued a warning, saying, "This cave. . . it's where the last
		  round of attacks occurred. . ."
		-Meeting each others' eyes, still-bleeding-a-bit To-Cao was the first to speak, "Rest here?"
		-That met with some cautious nods of assent, so To-Cao scurried off into a suitable niche
		 in the cave's wall, while Maya and Sarge ranged a bit forward, to peer at the rest of the
		 cave.
		-Sarge was the first to call our attention over, whispering, "Hey. I think I saw some
		  movement, up the slope there."
		 "Yeah," Maya agreed, "Some kind of quadruped, about the size of a gnome."
		-I couldn't see them from where I was at, but Maya and Sarge were speculating:
		 "Something from the Elemental Plane of Earth perhaps?"
		 "Yeah, they seem to be _eating_ the rock. . ."
		-That last caught the dwarves' attention.
			-"Wait! What if they eat the ore?!? This could all be a waste!"
			 "Well," Maya broke in, "We were asked to _guard_ you on your way here. They don't seem
			  much interested in _harming_ any of us, whatever they are. . ."
			 "But the ore!"
			 "Perhaps we can make an additional deal, then," she continued. "Say, 10% of the take
			  here, for the next two years."
			 "Two _years_! That's absurd!"
			 "Fine. One year."
			 "I have to eat! There's no way. . ."
			 "Six months?"
			 ". . . Here, we can scrape up _something_, and when we get back, we'll tell the king
			  you did a great job, killed tons of drow. He'll take care of rewarding you."
			 Turning to me, Maya asked, "Fred?"
			 "Well, we _do_ want to get in the king's good graces. . ."
			 "OK, Grognok. Deal."
		-With negotiations settled, To-Cao downed another healing potion, and we all began to creep
		 forward, Sarge and Maya taking the lead while I took a sniper's position, in cover behind
		 a bit of cavern wall, and To-Cao guarding me.
		-Suddenly, Sarge called out, yelling, "Drow!"
		-He unleashed some spells, towards something I couldn't see past a narrow spot in the cave,
		 and took a crossbow bolt in the course of it.
		-I called out to him, yelling, "Fall back! We can hold the chokepoint!"
		-He did just that and, under a hail of projectiles from our party (magical and otherwise) a
		 single drow warrior was slain.
		-No more were forthcoming so, after a few moments, we again cautiously advanced, Sarge in
		 the lead.
		-We found no more drow, but Sarge reported that he heard noises coming from a dark pit just
		 past the chokepoint.
		-To-Cao and I evidently had the same idea, as he tossed Sarge a bottle of lamp oil and
		 stated simply, "Flame."
			-"Yeah," I added. "Got any more of that hot sauce?"
		-He reacted with a smile, and began to pour the lamp oil down the hole.
			-Up from the pit, though, came a grumbling voice, saying, in broken, halting Common,
			 "Friend? No fight?"
			 ". . . Yeah, we can talk," Sarge shouted back down.
			-Cautiously, one of the small quadrupeds from earlier crept up from the pit.
			-It and Sarge began a halting negotiation.
				-It introduced itself as a "Xorn", something Maya said was a kind of earth elemental.
				-It seems they're enemies of the drow too, and the one talking slowly made us
				 understand that the drow had taken their leader captive.
				-They wanted our aid with the matter, and, though the dwarves worried for their
				 profit margins and considered the mineral-eating Xorns pests, I was able to
				 convince them it's better to split the ore with the Xorns than to lose it all to
				 the drow.
				-With a deal struck, the Xorn offered us a "shortcut". It wasn't able to articulate
				 in Common how far away the rest of the drow were, but it suggested it could tunnel
				 through the rock for us.
				-Shrugging, I encouraged the dwarves to follow us, and in turn, we followed the Xorn.
	-The Xorn tunneled quickly through the rock of the cavern, the stone seemingly melting at its
	 touch, and we followed it.
		-It led us to another cavern in which, some distance away, we could see a series of circles
		 and diagrams inscribed on the ground.
		-Maya stared at it a moment, pronouncing it work of abjuration and illusion.
		-"I may be able to disrupt it," she said, and then blasted away at the outer circle of the
		 diagram.
		-That circle disrupted, the illusion fell away, revealing a larger Xorn, chained and bound
		 in the center of the inner circle.
		-With that, a voice called out, and a human in wizard's robes emerged from behind a pillar.
		-"Intruding on my work? Perhaps we can come to some resolution, avoiding disruption."
		 "Huh, maybe that's so," I responded. "We came expecting drow, but perhaps there's some deal
		  we can make. Come from Sharaar Kol too, huh? We heard you were poking about. . ."
		 "The drow. . . they were useful, after a fashion. I needed to find some privacy for my
		  work."
		 "Well," I began, "Negotiations require some attempt to satisfy both parties' desires, and
		  we know nothing of yours. Tell me, what exactly _is_ your work?"
		 "You misunderstand," the wizard replied. "Negotiations require two _equal_ parties. I have
		  no equals here. . ."
		-Well, that was essentially tailored to trigger my mix of daddy issues and "I hate god"
		 issues, so I was going to be crushing that man's mind even had he not then proceeded to
		 take a knee, place a piece of paper on the ground, and call forth a huge, clawed demon.
		-To-Cao was quickest to react, leaping at the wizard and slashing him again and again.
		-As wounds opened, what turned out to be the _illusion_ of a wizard fell away, revealing
		 some horror that had the body of a woman from the waist up, emerging from the body of a
		 lion below, and which was brandishing a black scythe.
			-In fact, come to think of it, I'm pretty sure that clawed demon isn't real either. . .
		-Well, my plan was the same, so I stared at it and tried to break it's brain.
		-It appeared unphased, but Sarge and Maya blasting away at it _was_ a bit more phase-y,
		 and it _certainly_ didn't like To-Cao continuing to slash away at it.
		-Eventually, it was begging for mercy, mercy To-Cao did not grant as he slashed the
		 creature's throat and let it bleed out.
		-To-Cao then fell to disemboweling the thing and eating pieces, offering me it's heart.
			-"Neat! A souvenir!" I said, taking the heart in hand.
		-Meanwhile, Maya saw to scratching away the diagram powering the abjuration effect.
			-I eventually joined her, once she gave the all clear, grabbing a key from the
			 lion-woman's belt and using it to unlock and remove the chains _also_ binding the
			 captive Xorn.
		-That done, I called over our Xorn guide, and the dwarves we were here to guard.
		-The two Xorn's had a happy reunion in their rumbling language.
		-Afterwards, I assisted the dwarves and Xorns in coming to an amicable arrangement, and
		 they began to (very quickly, due to the assitance of the Xorns) mine the cavern system's
		 precious metals.
		-Under our watchful eyes, it was done without further trouble, and soon we were on our way
		 back to the city, our shares in hand.


TODO:
	-Mention the awful creature the wizard turned out to be (maybe some kind of demon?) to the high
	 priest.
	-Also make sure the miners hold to their end of the deal, and talk us up to the king.


1/11/23:
	-Returning from the mines, collecting Jade, and heading to the temple, we found it crowded, with
	 some kind of ceremony or celebration underway.
		-I asked one of the guards outside the temple what the occasion was and he said it was a
		 celebration in honor of the return of the high priest to his full duties.
		-He'd apparently emerged from his seclusion, triggered by his captivity at Nkondi's hands,
		 boasting of new revelations recieved from Moradin.
		-"Oh? What revelations are these?" I asked.
		 "Why not go in, and listen?"
		 "Well, sure, I suppose we shall. . . Come on folks, lets get good seats."
		-Jade and Maya both volunteered to translate for the rest of us.
	-Walking into the temple, we found ourselves seats on one of the benches, and watched the show.
		-Up at the altar, the high priest was recounting his visions, his voice full of excitement
		 and holy fervor. He said that Moradin had revealed to him that, "A ring of light has opened,
		  at the bottom of our mines! We should not fear it, or what lies inside! I am calling for a
		  militia, a crusade to seize and conquer what lies beyond it, for our people's glory and
		  profit!"
		 "To do so," he continued, "We must seize the Tome of Storms from within. If it is not taken
		  in time, we will be cut off from the rest of the world. . ."
		-The crowd was boistrous, and clearly receptive to the priest's message.
		-We could see, though, the king, in the front row, looking a bit unhappy about the whole
		 affair.
		-The priest, however, called him up to the altar, saying, "Our king must lead us in this!
		  Come up here, Your Majesty!"
		-The king slowly obliged, seeming reluctant, but his hands were apparently forced. As he
		 approached the altar, the crowd quieted, and he spoke of calling for a council to organize
		 an expedition to the portal.
			-Not exactly rushing into it, but sounds like he's somewhat reluctantly going along
			 with it.
	-Watching this, Maya, whispering to us, raised the matter of the demon in the mines, and the
	 suspicious timing of the two events.
		-"A demon?!? What demon?" Jade exclaimed, to some amount of shushing from the dwarves
		 around us.
		 "I think it was a demon?" Maya replied. "A lamia, I believe?"
		-I began digging in my pack, pulling out a lump wrapped in bloody cloth. "Want to poke a
		  demon heart?" I asked Jade. "We brought you a souvenir. . ."
		-Jade recoiled, blurting, ". . . No."
		 "No? Well, I guess I'll keep it, then. I wonder if you can stuff and mount a heart. . ."
	-The ceremony soon devolved into various patriotic songs, and soon the king was gathering his
	 entourage and making his way out of the building.
		-Maya, with impetuous confidence no doubt born of her own high birth, called out, waving,
		 and gained the attention of the kings entourage.
		-"You there!" one heavily armored dwarf called out, "What do you want with the king?"
		 "We have information concerning the high priest's revelations," Maya replied. "There was
		  a demon, in the mines. . ."
		-That apparently piqued the king's interest as he waved us over, and granted us a walking
		 audience as he made his way back to his throne room.
		-Maya introduced herself as "Maya Dracus, a noble of Sasserine", and shared with the king
		 that her father had tasked us with doing something about the Quickhammers, who were
		 expanding into Sasserine.
		-She also showed him the forged signet ring we were given, causing the king to call for one
		 of his entourage to fetch "Douley, that idiot."
		-By the time we reached the throne room, the dwarf Douley was waiting for us there.
			-She was apparently a noblewoman, whose finger bore the mark of a missing ring.
			-Handing our ring to her, she placed it on her finger, and the mark indeed matched our
			 ring.
			-The dwarves told us it was clearly the one recently stolen from her, though modified.
			-"Tell us again," the king commanded, "How was it stolen?"
			 "I. . . well, I fell asleep at a party. Rats took it. . ."
				-Rats? The lady seemed a few coppers short of a gold. . .
		-Before we could probe the lady's story much, the king turned to us, saying, "You will swear
		  us an oath, superseding those which granted you access to the lower city. Here, take this
		  scroll. . ."
			-The king then led us through an oath swearing that we would, "Do whatever it takes to
			  stop the Quickhammers, in the name of the king."
			-"_Anything?_" Sarge clarified.
			 ". . . Violence is sometimes regrettably necessary."
				-That elicited a nod from Sarge.
			-Maya looked at the scroll, pronouncing it a "writ of inquisition", announcing our right
			 to investigate on behalf of the king.
			-Maya also requested the return of the ring, as we might need it in our investigation.
				-The king assented, but insisted we return it to Douley restored to it's original
				 state when we were done, giving us 100 gp. to take care of the repairs.
		-Tasked a second time to address these Quickhammers, we were soon dismissed by the king to
		 see to it.
	-Leaving the palace, we debated our next steps on the street outside. I pushed for returning to
	 the temple, to at least learn more of what the priest experienced, and this portal.
	-The rest of the crew was amenable to that, so we were soon on our way to the temple, to speak
	 again with the priest.
		-The crowds now gone, we were quickly ushered into an inner chamber of the temple, where the
		 high priest greeted us warmly.
		-Getting down to business, I reported the success of the expedition, but also the disturbing
		 presence of the demon.
			-"What did you call it, Maya? A 'lami'?"
			 "A lami_a_, Fred."
		-The priest seemed concerned, and said then, "Hmm. . . there was a portion of my vision I
		  did not earlier understand. It seemed a lion _chair_, but. . . hmm. . ."
		-Maya, though, broke in, seeking to dissuade the priest from his crusade, "With demons about,
		  known for their lies, can you _really_ be sure of this vision?"
		-That unsurprisingly offended the priest. "Are you questioning my wisdom in this? It was a
		 vision from Moradin! What do you know of matters of religion?
		-"We're not doubting you," I broke in, "But warning that these creatures are lurking about.
		  After all, if this portal is all you promise, that alone might be reason for the beasts
		  to take an interest, and, where demons walk, there's sure to be danger."
		 "You. . . are not wrong," the priest replied. "What did this demon look like?"
		-I described the lamia to the priest, and also volunteered that, "We have it's heart too. I
		  suppose a priest might be able to do something with that?"
		 ". . . you have it's heart? That's. . . not exactly enough to interrogate. But that's also
		  rather odd, for several reasons. Demons usually disappear upon their death. . ."
		 "Hmm. . . that is so. . ." Maya confirmed. "It _summoned_ another demon, though."
		 "I'm not sure that thing was real, Maya," I clarified. "Our hands, and blades, passed
		  right thought it."
		 "An illusion?" the priest asked. "Did you see how this was accomplished?"
		 "We did! Here. . ." I replied, as I began to dig in my pack.
		-Finding the Deck of Illusions, I pulled it out and showed it to the priest, saying, "It
		  used these. Not exactly scrolls, but something along those lines. . ."
		-Examining the deck, the priest mumbled, ". . . This. . . it casts some doubt on my vision."
		 "Before we struck the lamia, or whatever it was," I added, "the creature disguised itself
		  as a human wizard. A wizard that was seen around Sharaar Kol before we encountered it in
		  the mines. . ."
		 "Oh, if only you had brought this to me sooner," the priest lamented, "But now, after the
		  speech. . . Well, you've seen how the people of the city feel about the matter. . ."
		 "Perhaps we can at least proceed more cautiously, though," Maya proposed.
		 "Yes. . . with demons and drow both about, perhaps sending paladins to examine and guard
		  the portal. . ." the priest replied.
		 "It would certainly make the king happy," Maya agreed, "To slow things down a bit. As to
		  the people, there could perhaps be a party, a celebration and send off for the scouts. . ."
		 "I like the way you think, Maya!" I chimed in. "Get some strong drink. . ."
		-We'd certainly given the priest something to think about, and, thanking us for the news,
		 he asked that we leave him to seeing to the arrangements.
	-From there, we returned to our favorite shop in town, The Vault of Miredhel, to unload the
	 enchanted scythe and cards from the mines.
		-It's proprietor was indeed buying, and we walked out each about 900 gold richer (save Jade
		 who didn't join us in the mines).
	-With that settled, we didn't have anything else we wanted to address until our meeting with the
	 Quickhammers.
		-We discussed some potential conversational gambits, but then I adjourned to a nearby bar,
		 to entertain myself until the day arrived.
	-When the appointed day came, we made our way to the alley we'd last met the Quickhammers in,
	 where we were soon joined by the same two dwarves.
		-Greeting them, we made the hand off, and they gave us the agreed upon gold (which came to
		 456 gp. for each of us).
		-We also inquired about future work, for the rest of us as well as Jade.
			-"It's always nice to feel included. . ." I said.
			-They spoke of. . . opportunities for us to remind people of their obligations. "You
			  know, debts and such."
			-"What about Jade, then?" I asked.
				-"Well," the dwarf asked, "What are your specialties? Can you make things that help
				  with stealth? Perhaps to make someone invisible?"
				 ". . . I can manage that," Jade replied.
				-"She might need a better place to work," Sarge broke in.
				 "Yeah," I added, "An artificer is only as good as her tools, and the current
				  situation is less than ideal. She's working out of a boat."
				 "Sure, sure. We can help with that. There's a back room at an alchemist shop in
				  town, Sappha's Mystical Tinctures. She's a friend. You can work there."
				-"As for the order," he continued, "Make us five potions of invisibility and five
 				  elixirs of swimming."
		-Maya pressed them on what they can do for _us_, what makes them worth helping.
			-The dwarf hemmed and hawwed, asking if paying work was not enough, but Maya pressed.
			-First they volunteered their services getting us in and out of Sasserine, as well as
			 "safe" places to rest in the city, despite our currently wanted status.
			-Pressed a bit further as to _how_ they could get us into the city, the dwarf eventually
			 relented and admitted that they had "teleportation points", to avoid the "usual risk of
			 error". He claimed one in nearly every district, and suggested we might enjoy the use
			 of the one in the noble district.
			-Seemingly delighting in dribbling out these secrets, he then added, "It's in a noble
			  family's library. . . Can you guess which one?"
			-Maya simply glared at him.
			-"Not a fan of riddles, huh? Well, it's House Thoreous," he admitted. "They run dredging
			  and waste disposal in the city."
		-"So, about that debt. . ." our Quickhammer representative continued. "The man is a guard,
		 and gambler. You can have 30% of the debt as your fee."
			-"And if they won't pay? Do you want us to make an example of him?" Sarge asked.
			 "Well, yeah, one certainly must prove they're men of their word. . . If that's
			  necessary, I'll arrange some fee for you instead."
		-"So," the dwarf went on, "When do you want to meet our wizard? Tomorrow morning work?"
		 "First," Maya interjected, "What are your intentions for the city of Sasserine?"
		 "Well, the city is in chaos, offering us an opportunity, for business, and maybe to take
		  control. Or, well, to _liberate_ the city."
		-Changing the subject a bit, the dwarf returned to tommorrow morning, saying, "Does meeting
		  our wizard the next morning work, then?"
			-Seeing reluctant nodds and shrugs from us, he continued saying, "OK. He's in room five
			  at The Broken Hammer inn. He'll be expecting you. As for me, I've other business to
			  attend to. We'll get in contact with you when the deed is done."
		-As they departed, Sarge spoke up, saying, "Shall we find some place we can chat?"
		 "Perhaps back at the ship?" I suggested.
			-That met with nods, so that's where we headed.
	-Once back, Maya was evidently feeling paranoid, and began looking about for magic auras
	 indicating scrying.
		-Jade joined in too, and they claimed to have indeed found some aura of divination.
		-They proceeded to attempt a variety of odd schemes, to learn more.
		-First separating all of us, they claimed the divination was following _me_.
			-"Well, I do have many admirers. . ."
		-I drew the line when they asked me to start disrobing.
			-Well, removing all of my magic items, they said.
			-"This is starting to feel like a robbery. . . What exactly are you aiming to do here?"
			 I asked.
			 "You don't want all of your magic items to be dispelled," Jade replied.
			 "Oh! You want to dispell this? Won't that get rid of that Darkvision the mage-priest-
			  lady granted me? I'm not looking to give that up. . ."
			-That sent them back to the drawing board, and then eventually to a shop for scrolls.
				-I shrugged, sat down at the table in the ship's cabin, grabbed a drink, and dug
				 into some pemmican with To-Cao. "This stuff is really growing on me, bug-boy. . ."
	-Once they returned with a scroll of Nondetection, it took Jade a couple of tries, but she got
	 it up and running, and we got to talking.
		-We debated how far we really want to cooperate with these folks. Most weren't too
		 enthusiastic about playing legbreakers.
		-Maya raised the possibility that her father, having tasked us with investigating this,
		 might be willing to buy the man's debt, allowing us to claim success and giving him some
		 hold on the man.
			-The debt is apparently 5,000 gp., which is pricey, but also suggests the man is
			 probably someone of means (sort of) to have been extended that kind of credit.
		-I mentioned that we now at least have knowledge of how the Quickhammers move in and out of
		 Sasserine, along with one of the points at which they do so. We _also_ know they have some
		 connection to House Thoreous, who do _dredging_, and Maya kept having those visions about
		 some dreadful magic pearl in the lagoon. . .
		-Maya also worried that the nobles of House Thoreous and others in Sasserine would recognize
		 her, but Sarge and I both volunteered our services in creating a mundane disguise.
			-(The skill is indeed untrained.)


2/1/23:
	-We spent some time discussing our plans for this debtor.
		-Apparently, he's a member of Sasserine's city guard.
		-Maya expressed some interest in assuming the debt _herself_.
			-Pull with a guard _would_ come in handy with our current goals, investigating the
			 Quickhammers and all.
				-In fact, after pulling his iron out of the fire, as it were, he might have useful
				 information about the Quickhammers' operation in Sasserine already, having racked
				 up that debt to them. . .
			-She also seemed to have some charitable feelings where his plight is concerned, hoping
			 to induce him to quit his gambling.
		-Maya also threw out the idea of contriving a reason to return to Sharaar Kol via a different
		 route, to perhaps learn more about routes the Quickhammers have in and out of Sasserine.
		-We also had been planning on disguises for our trip to Sasserine (on account of Maya's
		 prominence and my noteriety).
			-I'd heard a troupe of gnomish entertainers had recently arived in Sharaar Kol.
			-They seemed like they'd have the supplies we need, so we figured we'd pay them a visit.
				-Making our way down to the trade city, we headed over to their caravan.
				-Evidentally, from the their routine in front of it, they're _mimes_.
				-Well, I just so happen to be fluent in that universal language, dance.
				-Maya joined me in that dance off, and the gnomes seemed to get the idea, scurrying
				 off to their cart, and returning with some face paint and a wig that they proceeded
				 to apply to To-Cao.
					-Soon, he was wearing a dress, blonde wig, and gloves over his clawed hands.
					-Well, _he_ didn't really need the disguise, but that'll at least draw some
					 attention from the ones of us that do!
				-Following that, they turned their attention to me.
					-I attempted to again get my intention across via dance. I first struck my
					 naturally heroic pose. Then, passing a handover my face, I made my expression
					 flat, and my body small, hunching my shoulders inward. I then danced my way
					 behind To-Cao, and peer furitively around his thorax.
					-The gnomes seemed to get my message, and ushered me over to one of their wagons,
					 where they set about applying makeup, and something that resembled a judge's
					 starched white wig, though one that, through a work of illusion, soon turned
					 a garish chartreuse.
					-They also offered me a checkered play-knight's costume, to which I nodded, held
					 up a hand, and, uttering a command word, changed my glamered armor to match.
				-I was soon joined by Maya and Jade too, who received makeovers of their own,
				 followed by Sarge.
				-In barely an hour's time, we were soon all garishly disguised. People would
				 certainly be taking note of us, but we hardly looked like ourselves.
				-We tipped the gnomes handsomely for their flashy work, and were then ready for our
				 trip.
			-To go with the disguises, though, Maya insisted we stop at a candy shop on the way to
			 see the wizard, buying a gold's worth (tons).
	-Arriving at the inn, where the Quickhammers' wizard was staying, we attracted quite a few
	 strange looks as we walked into the crowded common room.
		-The bartender asked us if we were lost, but I told him we were here to see a friend.
			-"It's his birthday! He's going to be _so_ suprised! He told us to show up in fancy
			  dress."
			 "Oh, aye? How old are they turning?"
			 "Fucked if I know. He's more of a drinking buddy. . . Mind if we head up to his room?"
		-Knocking on the wizard's door, he shouted through it, "Go away! We don't want any!"
		 "Oh, I'm quickly hammmering on your door because I'm _sure_ you do. . ."
			-That got the door open, and our disguises got a wide eyed look.
				-"Didn't know we were _that_ desperate for help. . ." the wizard said.
				 "Sometimes the best place to hide is in plain sight, in the blinding light," I
				 replied.
			-He then asked if we were ready to go, warning us it was a one-way trip, but Maya asked
			 about a way back.
				-He told us about a vault in Sasserine's central bank, telling us to ask about a
				 "Q account", and a code, "72 12 8".
			-That settled, he cast his spell, and soon we stood in a dusty backroom full of damaged
			 books and binding materials.
				-Seeing a (mischevious) opportunity, Maya scrawled across a noble emblem, "House
				  Dracus is better!"
				-Joining in, I picked a random book, flipped to a random page, an scrawled, "Fred
				 was here!"
				-Jade scowled at us, but leafed through a few of the damaged titles.
		-Slipping out the door of the room we arrived in, there were a few people hunched over books
		 in the next room, but we were able to creep past them unheard to a door across the room.
		-That led to a windowless tunnel, the dankness of which suggested we might be undergound.
		-Maya thought there was something off about one of the walls, and Jade spotted a protruding
		 bit of brick she pointed out to me.
			-Not sure what she expected me to do about it, I shrugged and gave it a swift kick.
			-That caused a section of the wall to move inward slightly, but also prompted some
			 shouts of "What was that?" from the far end of the hallway we were in.
			-"Quickly! Inside!" I whispered, pushing the fake wall open further.
			-We hurried inside, finding ourselves in a ill-maintained corridor slopping upwards.
			-Picking our way over the rubble strewn floor, Sarge stumbled, and, someone, yelling
			 about "Damn rats!" cracked the secret door and threw some alchemist's fire within.
			-Sarge managed to catch it, preventing it from breaking open, but that only elicited a
			 shout of, "Damn! Must have been a dud. . ."
			-Sarge tried to scurry forward, but fell again, and, this time, a jar of alchemist's fire
			 struck him directly.
			-Rolling to put out the flames, that was thankfully followed by no more, and he more
			 carefully picked his way over the rubble, in a somewhat damaged costume.
		-Following that secret passage, we made emerged through another hidden door into a halway,
		 now above ground as evidenced by the sights outside arrowslits studding the hallway.
		-Footsteps came from one direction down the hall, so we headed the other way, only to hear
		 more approaching us, so we slipped through a convenient door.
			-Inside was a colorfully painted room, with a child playing with some blocks facing away
			 from us, in between us and a large window.
			-Maya skipped right up to the kid, whispering, "Hi! I'm your patron fairy! Here, have
			  some candy!"
			 "Oh! Wow! Yay!"
			 "Do you want to play prank?"
			 "Yeah!"
			 "See my helpers over there? They need to get out of here without your father seeing
			  them. . ."
			 "Why? He doesn't believe in you!"
			 "They have iron, though. . . We fairies hate iron."
			 "Oh. . ."
			-While they were occupied with that, the rest of us made it over to the window, and
			 started getting it open.
			-Soon, the kid was shouting, "Dad! Dad! Come meet my fairy friend!" and we were
			 scurrying out the open door.
		-The window led to a small yard, and a high fence.
		-Handing To-Cao a length of rope, though, he quickly lept the fence, and the rest of us
		 were soon over it using the rope.
	-Now on the streets of Sasserine's noble district, we went to go see a guard about a debt.
		-We'd been told the guard was employed directly by The Dawn Council, and his name, so we
		 started asking around about him.
		-We heard he gambles at a place called "The Wolf's Den", and were told to knock seven times
		 at the door to gain entrance.


2/8/23:
	-Sasserine was looking pretty sad these days.
		-Many shops were closed in the middle of the day, and streets that should have been crowded
		 were instead empty and debris strewn.
	-We decided to swing by Maya's family estate.
		-Now inside the city, and not emerging from a possibly illicit teleport mark inside another
		 family's estate, she felt it wise to change and assume the full authority of her position.
	-On our way there, though, we heard a commotion coming from a cross street we were passing, and,
	 being the intrepid souls we are, we opted to run towards trouble.
		-The shouts and clangs turned out to be a number of the city's guards battling rat people,
		 more of those jerk shapers!
		-I warned my fellows that I'm a bit. . . too popular with the city's guards these days, and
		 was unsure how my disguise would hold up to close inspection, but Maya was full of
		 righteous fury. She grew some kind of magic wings and (literally) flew into the fray.
		-I shrugged, and the rest of us followed her into battle.
		-Maya and Sarge began blasting away at the ratmen, and I shot one so damn well the arrow
		 passed through it's skull and dropped the bastard behind him too.
		-I, though, resisted my impulse to crow about that success, and slunk off down the nearby
		 alley as To-Cao rushed forward and finished off another with a kukri.
		-The guards swarmed the last of the ratmen, manacling the wounded creature, with several
		 kicks along the way.
		-I wasn't about to stick around to speak with the guards, but, as I scurried off, I could
		 hear Maya chatting with them.
	-Eventually Maya walked back to the rest of us, I emerged from my alley, and we continued onto
	 the Dracus estate.
		-Maya thought she could sneak in through a gap in the estate's walls, something from her
		 rebellious youth, but it had apparently been sealed (many of the estates we passed in the
		 noble district seemed to have beefed up security).
		-She led us to a different option, a secret door, but even inside that, was given pause by
		 some kind of newly installed magic eye on a door blocking the way further down that hidden
		 passage, but, reading a nearby inscription (in elvish, and unintelligible to me), she
		 presented her signet ring and the door opened.
		-We were then greeted by guards, and Maya had some choice words about the new security
		 measure, given that we were investigating _fake signet rings_.
			-In fact, a quick test proved that the one we'd gotten our hands on sufficed to open
			 the door!
	-We were led from there to her lord father's study, recently renamed "The War Room".
		-There, he was pouring over maps depicting the ongoing gang war.
		-Greetings were exchanged, and apparently the gnomes do good work, as Lord Dracus asked
		 after my name before I revealed our past acquaintance.
		-Maya reported what we'd learned about The Quickhammers and their portals.
		-Lord Dracus doubted that Lord Thoreous would allow The Quickhammers to use his estate, and
		 presumed he must not know the existance of the beacon there.
		-That matter done for now, as we did not wish to crack down on the transit network _just_
		 yet, Maya then raised the matter of the guard officer's debt.
		-She was able to talk her father into backing her assumption of the guard's debt, and he
		 provided her with the necessary funds.
	-Soon we were on our way back out, but not before grabbing some food (and a drink or three).
	-The Wolf's Den was located within a ritzy ocean-front tavern, The Seaside Inn. Arriving there,
	the guards at
	 the door seemed perfectly happy to let Maya in, but were less fond of our still-ridiculously-
	 dressed selves, but she insisted we were her "bachelorette party".
		-Once within, we knocked as instructed, at a cellar door, and were admitted to the gambling
		 parlor.
		-Surveying the scene inside, the patrons were many and varied, though, weirdly, the dealers
		 all looked to be identical, apparently. . . septuplets?
		-Maya set about asking after a "friend" of hers, our guard Edmund. The employee she spoke
		 with seemed to know him, and obligingly offered to take a message to the man, who was here
		 recently and was now somewhere upstairs.
		-Watching the messenger, we saw him approach someone at a highrollers table in a raised area
		 above, and Maya swiftly followed, with the rest of us in tow.
		-He seemed none too receptive to Maya's offer to purchase his debt, saying he was "up a
		 thousand, and would be paying it off in no time."
		-She let it be known he didn't have the time, that The Quickhammers had sent _us_ to collect
		 it.
		-There was a fair amount of back and forth, with Maya playing the good cop to our bad-clown-
		 cops. The generosity of Maya's offer, combined with a threat or three from the rest of us,
		 eventually proved persuasive.
			-He seemed quite suspicious about what we were getting out of it, but he eventually
			 came to frame it as a power play by House Dracus, which made sense to him.
	-With that done, the sun was going down, and we retired to the Dracus estate for the evening,
	 to enjoy more of their hospitality, and their excellent wine.


2/22/23:
	-On our way back to the estate, the sun was going down, and the streets were rapidly emptying
	 as it did.
	-As we walked, Maya expressed an interest in combatting the city's gangs.
		-"Well, that's the plan, right? With the Quickhammers and all?" I said.
		 "Yes. I would not mind fighting _any_ of them, though. This is my home."
	-At an intersection, we heard a commotion, some yelling down the cross street. True to form, we
	 looked at each other, shrugged, and ran towards it.
		-Getting closer, we could make out words: a woman was yelling, "Help! Help! They took my
		 husband!"
		-Maya again sprouted wings and flew over to the woman, but that understandably alarmed her,
		 and she took off running.
		-"Whoa! Lady! Slow down!" I yelled, shouting after her. "You need some help?"
		-Looking back at me, she slowed and, with a quick glance to Maya above her, she said to me,
		 "Little green men. . . they attacked our carriage in The Champions District! They took my
		  husband, Loras, but I managed to run off as they ransacked the carriage. I. . . stole a
		  boat, to get here. . . Please! He needs help! I can pay. . ."
		 "Of course we will help you!" Maya replied.
		 "Yeah," I agreed. "We'll see what we can do. Coin certainly has a sweet music. . . Here, 
		  head on over to The Seaside Inn. We'll meet you back there, ideally with your husband in
		  tow."
		-I then added, "Oh! Also, where did you leave that boat?"
		-She indicated she'd left the boat at the docks in the Northeast corner of The Noble
		 District, and we were soon on our way there.
	-Arriving at the docks, there was indeed a small launch, hastily tied to one of the piers and
	 bobbing in the evening's rough seas.
		-"All aboard, folks!" I called. "I'll get us underway."
	-I got the boat unmoored and guided my volunteer rowers across the narrow channel to The
	 Champions District.
		-"Been there," To-Cao remarked, on the way to the district. "Where they took us to fight,
		  when they took us from queen. Before found new queen. . ."
		 ". . . Well, all worked out for the best in the end, eh?" I remarked.
		-His only response was clicking.
	-Once there, we could indeed see some kind of airship, hovering above the arena, and, as we
	 jogged through the streets to the arena, we could hear shouting coming from it.
		-I recognized the language as Goblin, suggested we hurry: they were yelling, "Make them
		 fight!"
	-To-Cao led us to one of the arena's gates and, taking a brief pause to fortify ourselves,
	 To-Cao ran, yelling, through the gate, lept onto a concession stand within, and buried one of
	 his kukri's in the skull of the goblin rummaging behind it.
		-With battle joined, the rest of us began to unleash a hail of projectiles into the arena's
		 entrance, as goblins ran to us from various corners of the arena, yelling and brandishing
		 weapons.
		-Sarge soon joined our bloody, buggy blender up front, and, leaning out from cover, I caught
		 the goblin that moved forward to engage with him with an arrow through the eye.
		-A particularly large and particularly bossy goblin moved forward, yelling at the his
		 fellows for their poor showing, but he was quickly surrounded by Sarge and To-Cao, and
		 finished off by a goblinbane bolt from Jade.
		-Through the doors from which he'd emerged, we could see the sands of the arena floor, on
		 which two humans were taking reluctant swings at one another, surrounded by a crowd of
		 shouting goblins. We ran through them, out onto the sands.
		-Sarge dropped a goblin that was fumbling at a nearby door, but not before he'd unlocked
		 and shoved the door open, and ominous stamping and snorting noises began issuing forth
		 from within it. . .
		-That soon proved to be an enormous rhinoceros, which began charging around the arena,
		 bowling over goblins, hapless hostages, and To-Cao alike.
		-Sensing the the greater threat here, Sarge melted the beast a bit, with some kind of firey
		 ray, while I wisely manifested a force screen and Maya blasted at it from above.
		-Clearly it didn't appreciate that, as it charged at Sarge, but he managed to duck behind
		 a pillar, which the creature slammed into and demolished instead.
		-All of this seemed to greatly amuse a jewelry-bedecked goblin in one of the spectator
		 booths above us, so I quickly crushed the mind of the rhino, which collapsed to the sand,
		 and began lining up a shot on our audience.
		-Meanwhile, Sarge blasted a goblin that was rushing towards a cage door built into the side
		 of the arena that, looking at it, apparently contained an unusually large lion. . .
		-That earned some rage, and a thrown javelin, from our spectator, who I unfortunately missed
		 with my (arrow) pointed response.
		-Sarge again made use of his firey ray, blasting the bastard in a somewhat more dramatic
		 respose.
		-Horribly burned, our spectator leapt into the arena, calling out, "I know when I'm
		  beaten. . . But I'm taking you all down with me!"
		-Clutching his burned chest, he ran over to the lion's cage and unlatched the cage's door.
		-Sick of that shit, Sarge finished the goblin off with another spell.
		-To-Cao stared a moment at the diced goblin at his feet, but then, bold as ever, rushed at
		 the lion, slashing at it's face with one of his kukris.
		-He looked like he could use some help so. . . I sought a good vantage point from which to
		 do so by climbing up one of the cage doors and into the stands above.
		-A rope then fell from the airship above, dangling down, presumably an offer of escape from
		 Maya (since no goblins were pouring down it).
		-It was also now readily apparent to me why To-Cao had been staring at his last goblin
		 victim: it's pieces were inching together, and the goblin was slowly reforming.
		-While To-Cao and the lion traded slashes, Jade crept cautiously towards the oddly blending
		 resistant goblin, and then shot it with her crossbow, which seemed to impede the progress
		 of it's reassembly somewhat.
		-Some shouting above called my attention up to Maya, who appeared to be trying to drag a
		 goblin out the window of the zeppelin without much success.
		-In an effort to aid To-Cao, I clambered up onto the low barrier between spectator seating
		 and the arena. Then, balancing carefully, I walked along that and into the enclosed VIP box
		 previously occupied by our lion-loving comedian, from which I was able to lean out, catch
		 sight of the lion, and crush it's mind.
			-Delightfully, the VIP box was full of liqour bottles, so I grabbed the nearest one to
			 hand, which proved to be a two hundred year old bottle of Elven brandy.
		-To-Cao rescued, he rushed back over to the reforming goblin and reblended it.
		-That only being about as effective as before, Sarge pulled out a flask of alchemist's fire,
		 dumping it over the pieces. Despite being on fire, though, they continued to squirm and
		 reform.
		-Jade, meanwhile, began to climb up the rope to the airship above.
		-To-Cao looked at those of us still around him and spoke, saying, "Wounded. Healing?"
		-Moving through the stands, I got closer to him, and then tossed him a pair of potions. The
		 toss went wide (he should have dived for it. . .) but at least they didn't break on the
		 sandy arena floor.
		-While he picked up the potions and chugged them, I clambered back down to the arena floor,
		 and walked over to the rope.
		-The unkillable goblin had managed to form a head by that point, though it still lay on the
		 ground, severed from the other bits of it's reforming body, and it croaked out, "Why can't
		 I die?!"
			-"We were hoping you knew, buddy," I responded, in Goblin.
			 "God said when I die my family would be rich."
			 "Ha! I always suspected the gods were a bunch of pricks. . . Well, here, want to call a
			  truce for the moment? Seeing as we can't kill you, just keep torturing you?"
			 "Yesss! I will grovel with Spike for your life!"
			-I gave him a few minutes, to fully reform.
			-Afterwards, he somewhat unsteadily got back onto his (new) feet, and, cringing,
			 shambled towards me and croaked out, "Friends?!"
			 "Sure buddy. Here, we'll drink on it," I said, passing him the brandy bottle.
			-After taking a swig, he passed the bottle back to me, and peered around the arena while
			 I did likewise.
			-"Boss is dead. . ." he eventually observed.
			 "Yeah. . . he was a jackass," I replied.
			 "Who boss now?"
			 "I'm the captain now," I said, smiling.
			 "Can you kill?"
			 "Sure! All sorts of things. . . Apparently not you, though."
			 "God said I would die when infinity ends."
			 "Yep, the gods are _definitely_ a bunch of pricks. I _wanted_ to live forever, so I
			  can't have it. You don't want it, so of course you're stuck with it.
			 "Agree. . . Can you take me to the end of infinity?"
			 "Well, I've got an airship of my own, so I can take you all sorts of places. If you'd
			  know it when you see it. . . Well, why not?"
			 "Me be part of captain's crew!"
			 "Sure. . . Welcome aboard!"
			 "First mate Squee!" he shouted, making a salute.
			-After that, I noticed the generally inscrutable To-Cao staring at Squee. Jealously,
			 were I to hazard a guess. . .
	-With that settled, I suggested Squee lead me on a tour of my new ship, and we both climbed up
	 the rope.
		-On deck, we found three more goblins, groveling before a bewinged Maya, having surrendered.
		-After I introduced Squee, Maya asked the other goblins, in Common, if they'd like to
		 surrender and join our crew too, an offer which I translated. 
		-They were on board (figuratively and literally) so Maya began to discuss with Jade the
		 tailoring of uniforms while Squee delivered his promised tour.
		-The tour included the pedestrian and expected, like the bound air elemental ("Air beastie.")
		 and a torch ("Ouch."), but I was intrigued by a set of old, rusty cannons, albeit without
		 any powder, and downright delighted by what was clearly a treasure map, big red X and all!
			-Goblin treasure map: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560916449527332877/1078164916063711352
			-Maya recognized the name The Silver Staff: it's a tavern the city of Graywall. We have
			 a start!
	-The tour concluded, we slid back down the rope to the arena floor, where Sarge had freed a trio
	 of humans from another cage along the arena wall.
		-"Is one of you Loras?" I asked.
		 "Yes. . .that's me," one of the ragged men replied.
		 "Great! Your wife is looking for you! She sent us your way. . . She's waiting for you at
		  an inn; we can give you a ride back.
		 "Thank you! I. . . don't know what would have. . ." he said, trailing off.
		-Turning to the others, I asked, "What about the rest of you? Can we drop you off somewhere?"
		 "We're from the South. . ." one of them replied. "Perhaps. . . you could drop us off at a
		  guard post?"
		 "Sure! Well, assuming they don't shoot down my new ship. . . Maya! You're from the city.
		  Is there some flag or signal you could arrange?"
		-She looked thoughtful for a moment, nodded, and then set about scavenging bits of cloth
		 from around the arena.
	-When we returned to The Seaside Inn, and Loras to his wife, there was a tearful reunion.
		-Delightfully, she was as generous as she was grateful, and wrote out for us a promissory
		 note, cashable at Sasserine's noble bank for 15,000 gold.
		-"I don't carry that much cash on me. . ." she began.
		 "Of course, of course," I replied. "And with good reason, given the events of this evening!
		  We're familiar with the bank. . . It's no trouble."


3/8/23:
	-We spent some time discussing our next steps, while in Sasserine, and how and when we'd be
	 taking our leave of the city.
		-Jade expressed and interest in visiting the orphanage she was raised in, here in the city.
		-Several of my other companions were every bit as interested as I in collecting our pay.
		-There's also the matter what to do with our _new_ airship.
			-I asked Squee where the goblins came to Sasserine from, which he said was somewhere
			 to the North.
			-I also mentioned that I'd seen some of their kin on the deserted island South of the
			 Champions District, thinking it might offer a cost-free mooring option. Squee described
			 them as "scrappers", though, which had me thinking twice about leaving our boat in
			 reach of the isle.
			-In the end, Maya wrote to her father, who arranged a berth for us at the city's airship
			 docks, covering the cost.
			-Sarge raised the _other_ costs, of another ship, and suggested it's sale might be wise.
				-I was resistant, and _certainly_ didn't want to sell it's cannons.
				-I briefly suggested that one option there might be _recruiting_ elementals, instead
				 of binding them. I had to admit some sympathy for their state, but figure they
				 might be amenable to working for _shares_, same as any other crew, if suitably
				 persuaded.
		-We also talked of continuing to work against the city's various gangs.
			-Interfering with the Shapers or The Morticians' Guild would certainly be a thing we
			 could point at to ingratiate ourselves with a variety of parties: the guards, Maya's
			 family, and their rivals, The Quickhammers.
	-Following Lord Dracus's instructions, our goblin deckhands and I got our ship on it's way to
	 the docks.
		-Once there, we got the ship moored, and I instructed our goblins to keep watch over the
		 ship, placing Squee in charge. Maya handed them all handfuls of gnomish candy, and promised
		 Squee a portion of her loot if they keep the ship safe.
		-As we walked out onto the docks, Maya approached a guard, greeting him.
			-She warned him about our goblin deckhands, agreeing with his insistance that they
			 remain aboard the ship.
			-Continuing, she then mentioned that she'd been away in Sharaar Kol for some time, and
			 asked if The Morticians' Guild was still troubling the city.
				-He told us they were engaging in a kind of insurgency, loosing undead on the city
 				 in hit-and-run raids.
				-He also mentioned a suspected a base in the forest Southwest of the city, and that
				 their leader had vowed revenge on the city.
	-Well, that base in the forest seemed a promising lead, so we set about preparing ourselves to
	 go in search of it.
		-We discussed how to search and, none of us being especially competent trackers, we opted
		 to search from the air, and our new ship.
		-We also, though, stopped by our favorite herbalist, in the Champions District, in search
		 of relevant supplies.
		-The proprietor was sympathetic to your cause, and offered a discout, which Maya use to
		 purchase a potion or two, and some bottles of holy water.
		-After that, we retired to the Dracus estate, for dinner and rest, before the search.
	-Leaving the estate the next morning, we headed to the airship docks.
		-Maya had kindly collected a few bottles of wine for our new crew too, though I counciled
		 her to perhaps hand that over only _after_ the day's business.
		-Boarding the ship, the goblins were still asleep, but I woke them with a shout, saying,
		 "Wake up, my bucaneers! Your candy is here! And Lady Maya brought you a treat for
		  later. . . But, for now, we've got business to attend to! Lets get this ship in the air!"
	-We took the ship out over the ocean, circling around the city and then flying above the forest
	 to it's West.
		-"Keep an eye out!" I shouted to my crew and companions. "First to spot a zombie or the like
		  wins a prize!"
		-Some time later, Squee squeed, and called me over to the rail.
		-He pointed out an unnaturally discolored bit of tree cover that certainly _did_ look odd,
		 and which Jade confirmed was indeed not natural.
		-"Good eye, Squee!" I said, flipping him a gold piece, to his visible delight.
		-I then conferred with our winged (and sometimes winged) companions, and Maya volunteered
		 to fly down and take a closer look.
		-Making a pass, she returned to the ship, and indicated that the strange canopy appeared to
		 be some kind of illusion. Slightly translucent, she could sort of see through it, when up
		 close, and said there was some kind of building within.
		-Well, certainly _something_ is down there, so we debated prudently descending somewhere
		 nearby, or going in hot.
		-As if there was any doubt, we chose the latter, Maya and Sarge gliding down to secure our
		 landing site while I tied a rope for our descent.
		-They waved to us, indicating we were good to come down.
			-To-Cao was first down the rope, making it look easy, but, as I made a slower descent,
			 some jerk jerked the wheel, causing the rope to swing. I lept free to a nearby tree,
			 failing gracefully. Jade ran into similar trouble, though, and hit a few branches on
			 her way down.
		-Once we were all down, we regrouped, and Maya whispered, "I hear something. . . large,
		 moving about inside. . ."
		 "Well," I said, "Time to prepare, then. How do you want to do this?"
		 "Rushing in blasting worked well at the arena. . ." Maya began.
		 "Alright, reckless it is!" I finished.
	-To-Cao took the lead, moving towards the building's entrance through the underbrush, with the
	 rest of us close behind him.
		-As he rounded the corner, and moved in sight of the open doorway, we all heard a horrendous
		 clattering as a ten foot tall lizard skeleton rushed towards To-Cao.
		-We heard some chanting from within and, as dark energies streamed towards To-Cao, he
		 dropped his weapons turned to run.
		-That proved a grave (heh) mistake, as the lizard skeleton slashed at him with it's talons,
		 and my faithful companion collapsed to the ground, gushing ichor.
		-Sarge retaliated on his behalf, blasting the skeletal creature with firey ray, and Jade
		 joining in with her crossbow.
		-Maya, meanwhile, took again to the air, flying up above the building, and looking into
		 it's courtyard. She must not have liked what she saw, or the chanting that came from
		 within, as she was soon racing back out, as fast as her wings could carry her, towards the
		 ship.
		-I was wisely concealed in some bushes, so I slunk back, out of the monster's reach, before
		 popping up and blasting the skeletal beast with my Wand of Magic Missle.
		-Sarge then barked another firey spell, searing the monster and igniting the dry undergrowth
		 around him.
		-Jade hit it with another shot from her crossbow, and I hurled a bottle of holy water at the
		 horror. The blessed water that drenched it finally caused it to crumble to a heap of bones,
		 and those of us still here and on our feet dived for new cover.
		-The wisdom of that was immediately proved, as a hooded acolyte walked out of the entrance,
		 mumbling a spell, only for Jade and I to pop up and unleash a storm of projectiles her way,
		 dropping her before she could complete the spell.
		-Looking to repeat the feat, we all ducked back down into the bushes.
		-To our horror, though, a new skeletal creature emerged from the building and, bending down,
		 scooped up To-Cao's prone form, carrying him back into the temple.
		-My bug buddy was in trouble, so I crept forward, peering around the ornamental stone
		 railing that flanked the building's stairs.
		-Inside, I was disgusted, though not especially surprised, to see masked and cloaked figure
		 chanting over To-Cao's body as the insect warrior's flesh began to stir.
		-My remaining companions had crept forward to join me, the new skeleton (as big as the last,
		 though more humanoid) rushed out, swinging at Sarge.
		-It missed, but Sarge did not, as he reached out with his own claws crackling with energy.
		-I tried to enact my revenge, and to crush the mind of the bastard desecrating To-Cao's
		 corpse, but the masked figure was unphased, so I slunk away from the entrance and back into
		 the undergrowth.
		-Maya rejoined us in the fight then, blasting the skeletal horror too, and Jade loosed an 
		 arrow into the building.
		-The skeleton continued swinging at Sarge, and the masked figure moved up to join him.
		-Conveniently, that brought him back into my view, and popping up from the undergrowth, I
		 again directed the full force of my mind at his, this time sending him reeling.
		-Sarge followed that with a wave of flame, searing the masked jerk and crumbling his
		 skeletal companion.
		-Maya then finished of the masked figure with a blast of eldritch energies.
		-That didn't settle matters, though, and more chanting emerged from the building as Jade
		 rushed up to the entrance and loosed another crossbow bolt inside.
		-Meanwhile, from my vantage point, I caught a pair of the necromancers sneaking out the
		 back entrance of the building. I loosed an arrow in their direction, but the shot went
		 wide, so I called for my companions attention, alerting them to the encirclement or escape.
		-Sarge rushed into the building's front door, as Maya joined me in blasting at those
		 escaping out the back, dropping one of them.
		-The other kept running, but I pursued him, hitting him with an arrow in the shoulder as he
		 fled. Maya then finished him too, with another arcane blast.
		-Things sounding calm, I shouted up to Maya, saying, "Did that guard say something about a
		  reward?"
		 "Probably?"
		 "Eh, good enough for me," I replied, and, approaching one of the two downed while fleeing,
		-I sawed off his head, stuffed his holy symbol into his mouth, and moved onto the next one.
	-The battle settled, we settled into searching the building.
		-We ended up with an assortment of treasures, two suriving captives (one the seeming leader,
		 the one in the mask, who, after removing his magic mask, appears to have been a troglodyte),
		 and the heads and holy symbols of the rest.
		-We dragged the captives and poor To-Cao back up to the ship via rope, and returned to the
		 city.


TODO:
	-Sort out loot.
		-Finished pricing, and posted some questions about how we allocate some of the items: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1084255596372557985
	-Sort out how we handle crew shares.
		-Eh, I'm slowly coming around to the idea that salary is best. At this point, the airship
		 is mostly transit, rather than actively involved in winning rewards. Shares would make
		 more sense if we're going full pirate and capturing other ships.
	-Cash that check.
	-Start chatting up the air elementals.
		-_You_ weren't the one that bound them, or even renewed their bindings, though you have
		 benefited them. In fact, you hate one of the gods involved in the original ship's creation.


3/22/23:
	-We returned to Sasserine aboard the airship, docking it again in the berth Maya's father had
	 arranged for us.
	-Back in the city, we flagged down some guards, convincing them our friendly neighborhood mantis
	 man was in dire distress, in need of urgent clerical attention.
		-They looked rather skeptically at To-Cao's lifeless and half-diced form, but they were
		 persuaded to carry him to a nearby temple.
	-The rest of us then headed back to the Dracus family estate, to retire for the evening.
	-Upon waking, we broke our fast with delightful crepes, and a bit of breakfast wine.
		-All of us, that is, except Jade, who seemed to be late in waking.
		-We began to wonder as the morning stretched on, especially since she'd hardly had anything
		 to drink the previous evening (by Fred's standards).
		-Eventually, we overheard some guards at a nearby table, discussing the shift they'd just
		 finished, and a figure they saw sneaking _out_ of the estate (apparently less their
		 business than sneaking _in_).
		-"That wasn't a blonde human you saw, by any chance?" I broke in.
		 "They certainly had long, pale hair," one of the guards replied. "Difficult to see much
		  more than that by moonlight."
		 "Shit. Sounds like we should definitely go check on Jade. . . Thanks!"
		-Maya led the way to Jade's room. After knocking and a very brief wait, she opened the door,
		 revealing no Jade, but a note on her bed.
		-In the note, Jade said she'd gone to the orphanage she grew up in again, "to go see her
		 fairy godmother."
		-". . . that's questionable," I said, reading over Maya's shoulder. "Buuuut, I guess that's
		  her business. Well, if she's busy with her people, what do you say we resolve some of our
		  business in town? Unload the last batch of loot and cash that check?"
	-So, we next spent some time in Sasserine's market, selling the gear we collected from those
	 damned necromancers.
	-Following that, we made our way to the bank, where Maya handled the business, and we cashed in
	 our reward for the return of that woman's husband.
	-Now flush with cash, we strolled boldly through the streets, speculating as to what we'd like
	 to spend it on.
	-As we did so, though, we overheard a loud, excited conversation between several people.
		-They were speaking of some kind of "bull man", a few streets over, who was asking passerby
		 to smell some cloth.
		-Turning to my fellows, I said, "Shit. This I've got to see."
		-Earning a shrugs and nods from Sarge and Maya, I asked the group we overheard for directions
		 and we made our way over.
	-Following those directions, we indeed came upon an enormous horned hybrid of bull and man,
	 clutching a colorful scrap of cloth and accosting traffic.
		-As he caught sight of me, he began to stare back at me, then look back and forth between
		 me and his scrap of cloth.
		-Hmm. . . come to think of it. . . Looking down, I saw, shit, a bit of one pants leg from
		 my colorful disguise was missing.
		-He then made a beeline towards me and asked, "Do you know where this cloth came from?"
		-Sniffing loudly, he then added, ". . . it smells like you do. I found it in the arena. . ."
		 "Ah!" I replied. "Well, that's a bit of my life I'm fairly proud of. We indeed got into a
		  bit of a scrap there recently."
		-I explained that we'd fought some goblins there, securing the airship they'd arrived in
		 and rescuing their hostages.
		-He, in turn, explained that he'd been dreaming of a woman named Jade, and some kind of
		 magical orb. He'd tracked her to the orphanage, but she wasn't there, and then followed
		 on to the arena, where he'd found signs of the rest of us.
		-"Huh. Well, we _do_ know a Jade," I admitted. "We're actually looking for her, she having
		  ducked out last night and left a note saying she'd gone to that orphanage."
		 "Well, she wasn't there," he said.
		 "That's at least the trail we've got," I replied, "And her note said something about
		  visiting a 'fairy godmother'? Maybe we can do something with that. . ."
		-He shrugged, so we had him lead us to the orphanage, none of us having actually been there.
	-On our way to the orphanage, we also made our introductions.
		-He turned out to be named D'Roc.
		-Everyone with my gave their names, and, though I tried to be cagey, Sarge spoke for me,
		 saying, "And this is Fred."
		 "Shh! I'm supposed to be in disguise. . ." I hissed at the dragon-man. Turning to the
		 bull-man, I added, "There are. . . some, well, rather unflattering pictures of me about
		  town. . ."
		-D'Roc stared at me a moment, and then said, "Ah, yes. . . I was at the funeral. . ."
		 "Oh! Wild time, huh?" I quipped. "Well, trust me, the bounty isn't worth it. The paltry
		  sum is hardly worthy of someone of my stature. . ."
		 "I'm no bounty hunter," D'Roc replied.
		 "Ah. Good!"
	-Arriving at the orphanage, D'Droc knocked on the door, which was shortly answered by an elderly
	 woman who said, "Ah, you've returned!"
	 "I have," D'Roc responded, "And I've brought with me friends of Jade's."
	 "Well, I still haven't seen her since last you were here."
	 "Since this morning?" I broke in.
	 "Since last night," she corrected me.
	 "Well, that is when we last saw her," I replied. "Mind if we have a look around?"
	 "Very well. I'm the headmistress here. I last saw Jade going into the back yard. Let me show
	  you the way. . ."
	-We walked through the building, Maya handing out gnomish candy to the children, and emerged,
	 through the back, into a fenced and overgrown yard.
		-The yard featured a boarded up well and several trees.
		-Looking about, D'Roc looked thoughtful, and then pronounced one of the trees "strange",
		 and began poking around it's roots.
		-Eventually, he pointed out one of the roots, shallow but thick, that led from the tree to
		 the well. He and Maya agreed that there seemed to be some kind of connection between the
		 two objects.
		-D'Roc pried up the boards covering the well, and I tossed a stone down it, never hearing
		 it strike anything, neither water nor earth.
		-After several uneasy looks and a request for volunteers, we eventually ended up lowering
		 Sarge into the well.
		-He quickly climbed back up, though, describing a rippling pool of water at the bottom, and
		 he seems to have a distinct fear of water.
		-D'Roc, unlike the rest of us, claimed to be a competent swimmer, so he was next down.
		-He said he'd reached the water and said he was climbing down into it when his voice
		 suddenly cut short. Maya shined a sunrod down the well, but there was no sign of him, just
		 the gently rippling surface.
		-"Well, sounds like a portal to me," I pronounced. "Who's next?"
		-Reassured it wasn't water, Sarge was next, and soon we were all through.
	-On the other side of the portal, we each found ourselves dangling from the rope in a strange
	 (extra-planar, to my eyes) realm, one featuring platforms and corridors of decorated stone,
	 covered in brambles and floating in a starry void.
		-Making our way through the strange place, D'Roc was first to encounter a magical trap, one
		 that had him collapse, helpless, into a fit of laughter lasting several minutes.
		-The rest of us were able to move through that unphased (something we were willing to test
		 due to the minimal harm of the trap's effect), but we now had our guard up.
		-Maya, engaging some kind of arcane sight, soon announced another trap, in the next room,
		 one which Sarge dispelled with a scroll.
	-As we made our way further inside, D'Roc, in the lead, raised a hand and called a halt.
		-He described hearing what sounded like large rats to the South, and a woman in some
		 distress, though a door to the East.
		-All of us thinking of Jade, D'Roc rushed to the door and battered it down.
		-Inside, we could see Jade, and a satyr cowering in one of the corners.
		-There was no time for convesation, though, as a group of wererats rushed up from the South,
		 soon joined by a werewolf too.
		-Battle was joined, but they proved no match for D'Roc's ferocity and our artillery.
	-The lycanthropes sorted, Jade turned and addressed us, "What are you doing here?"
	 "Well," I replied, "For that matter, why the hell are _you_ here? What is this?"
	 "Ah, well, I fell down a well," she replied. "The Shapers are here, taking hostages, and I was
	  looking into it. . ."
	 "Yep, we found the well ourselves, looking for where you got off to. Looks like a good thing
	  we did. . ."
	 "Yeah. . . I was going to die. . . Oh! Speaking of which, could I have some of your silver
	  arrows?"
	 "Sure!" I replied. "Here. . ."
	-Jade set immediately to removing their arrow heads and attempting to bind them in place of the
	 heads on her crossbow bolts, but I quickly broke in, "Also, meet the man-minotaur, D'Roc!
	  Sounds like he has some business with you. . ."
	 "Yes. I've been having dreams. . ." he volunteered. "You were _in_ them. . ."
	 "So. . ." Jade replied, "I'm the girl of your dreams?"
	-Exploring that further had to wait, though, as another group of lycanthropes approached from
	 the southern corridor and we were back to the bloody work.
	-Fortunately, they were a poor match for us, and soon the few were-rats that remained among the
	 living had fled.
	-Sarge, though, called out, around a corner from me, saying, "What the hell is that?!?"
		-Joining him there, I saw a great orb, covered in many of the winding brambles that ran
		 throughout this strange place.
		-Sarge and Jade mumbled a bit, speculating that it was perhaps the _source_ of the brambles.
		-Sarge then shrugged and hurled a jar of alchemist's fire at the thing, attempting to set it
		 on fire.
		-That indeed burned away some of the brambles, revealing some kind of metal. . . cauldron,
		 perhaps, beneath them.
		-But, it also sent Sarge reeling, clutching his head, and mumbling, saying, ". . . the
		 blood. . . Shit! We're under fire. . . get to the guns. . ."
			-He seemed lost for the moment, perhaps in unpleasant memories.
		-Well, I'm not going anywhere near that fucking thing. Don't need a parade of my most
		 embarassing moments from the creche or something.
		-D'Roc was far less cautious, though, and, striding up to it, he swung his enormous axe at
		 the cauldron, cracking it and spilling some of the liquid within. He too, though, was sent
		 reeling, mumbling, ". . . mom?"
		-Maya, gazing within, said, ". . . I can see visions, within. . . Of Sarge and D'Roc!"
		 "I think it's feeding on our aggression," Sarge got out, "Drawing power from it."
		 "I've got an idea," Maya said, a look of concentration coming over her face.
		-A moment later, there was a loud crack and the cauldron fell to shards, water rushing out.
		-The destruction of the cauldron revealed an unconscious fairy, laying amidst the water and
		 shards, and a tuning fork.
		-"Godmother!" Jade exclaimed.
		-Maya reached out with a potion, offering it to Jade, who rushed forwarded and poured it
		 gently into the unconscious fae's mouth.
		-Her eyes fluttering, the fairy woke, saying, ". . . the iron. . . it's gone. Jade! I knew
		  you'd come! I sent the dream, but could only hope. . ."
		 "What happened here?" Jade asked.
		 "This key. . . I traded for it, with a fae that lives in the realm of death it is tied to.
		  But, he was treacherous, and his gift was barbed. . ."
		 "Why would you do such a thing, godmother?" Jade asked, plaintively.
		 "For _you_, Jade! It had been so long since you'd visited. . . It goes with your orb. . ."
		 "Shit!" I broke in. "This is more Brotherhood stuff? Ugh. . ."
	-Jade's fairy godmother then warned us that there were more of the shifters lurking about, and
	 that they may be able to move more freely now that the brambles were gone.
		-As such, we made our way back through the strange corridors, collecting the sad satyr, who
		 also freed several sprites from a nearby cabinet.
		-We made our way back through the portal, the fey following us, and, once we were through
		 it, the fairy from the cauldron uttered an incantation, and the well collapsed.
		-In response to that noise, the headmistress emerged from the backdoor of the orphanage,
		 exclaiming, "Oh! Jade! You're back! . . . is the well safe?"
		 "Yes," Jade replied. "It's been sealed. But, there were. . . others down there. How did
		  they get there? Did they come past you?"
		 "Well," the headmistress said, "There were some inspectors, from the city. . ."
		-The headmistress then made her excuses, going back inside to look after the children, and
		 and Maya joined her, to distribute more of her gnomish candy.
		-The headmistress had seemed to pay no attention to the fey with us and, looking close, they
		 did seem. . . slightly translucent, to my eyes?
			-In any event, I asked them what was next for them.
			-Jade's "godmother" responded, "The damage to my realm was immense. I will be petitioning
			  the fey courts, for restitution. We thank you, though, for your aid in this. It will be
			  remembered. . ."


4/5/23:
	-The band back together, we caught Bram up on our recent hobby of getting unnecessarily involved
	 in gang wars.
		-To his credit, he took it in stride and seemed eager for action.
		-All of us being resolved to keep getting into that flavor of trouble, despite the body
		 count, we then debated what gang was our next priority.
		-I raised the question of whether we were due to report back to the Quickhammers, it now
		 having been a couple of days since we left on our debt collection mission. That might be
		 good reason to spend some time focused on them, though it would also mean coming up with a
		 more detailed plan than "stab what moves".
		-Maya, on the other hand, was more concerned with the Shapers and the necromancers, on
		 account of their rather aggressive options for recruiting (by infection and by raising the
		 dead respectively).
		-I found that rather persuasive, since our stabbing members of the other gangs would tend
		 to _help_ the remnants of The Morticians Guild, so we all decided to keep aimed in that
		 direction.
		-I then raised the matter of leads, and, to that end, drew forth a now slightly rotted
		 severed head from my pack, with a Morticians holy symbol stuffed in it's mouth.
			-"Ah yes," Maya said, "We were going to deliver those to the guards, in hopes of a
			  reward, and perhaps they have more leads for us."
			 "Yep! A reward was exactly what I had in mind!" I replied. "Though. . . I don't really
			  want much face time with the guards right now, on account of the wanted posters, so
			  you should probably handle that.
			-"Here, catch!" I then shouted, tossing the severed head to her, but she stepped out of
			 the way and behind Sarge, letting it fall to the ground. "Hey! That was a perfect
			  throw. . ." I protested.
			 "I would. . . rather not," she replied. "Besides, helping the guards _would_ go a long
			  ways towards clearing your name. . ."
			 "Yes, but I'm not sure showing up at a guard post with a pair of severed heads is
			  going to give them the impression I've changed my ways. . ."
			-Fortunately, D'Roc proved less squeamish, and grabbed both the first head from the
			 pavement and the other I dug out of my pack.
	-We decided I, and Jade who had a project to work on, would wait for them back at the Dracus
	 estate, while the other three went to go speak with the city guard.
		-Arriving back at the estate, I let the guards who greeted me know that Lady Maya had gone
		 off to speak with the city guard about taking futher action against the necromancers, and
		 we did some shared commiserating about what jerks they are.
		-I'd barely poured myself a drink, though, before another guard came in search of me, saying
		 that Lord Dracus wanted to see me urgently.
		-Rushing with the guard to the lord's study, I found him watching an enchanted pen scrawling
		 out what turned out to be a message from Maya. He gestured me over and had me take a look
		 at it too. It said:
			Hello Daddy!
			Tell Fredrick to get his cute butt over to (Address) Skeletal nasties have taken
			dragonnapped Sarge. They went underground! 
			kisses!
			Your beloved daughter
		-"Well, sounds like I'm off again!" I told Lord Dracus, but also grabbed the pen a scrawled
		 a quick reply:
			Jade and I are on our way, Maya! We'll meet you there!
		-I also took a moment to ask Lord Dracus about the address, and he indicated it was somewhere
		 in the southern corner of the noble district, so Jade and I were soon on our way.
	-By the time we found the other, Sarge was already back, and they were standing around an opening
	 into the city's catacombs.
		-I asked what had happened and they told me that Sarge had briefly been snatched by some kind
		 of skeletal assassin, an S-something (never heard of it), invisible and silent. In fact, only
		 Sarge actually saw the creature, when he was snatched up by it, and rendered invisible to,
		 until he managed to fight free of it's grasp.
		-Maya also claimed that she'd be able to see their magical auras and we resolved to follow
		 the creatures down into the catacombs.
		-We promptly got lost, spending an hour or more wandering the maze-like tunnels, until we
		 eventually found ourselves back at the tunnel mouth we'd entered the catacombs from.
		-We tried again, with D'Roc trying this time to track the creatures _by scent_.
		-This time, we met with some better success, and D'Roc led us out another catacomb entrance,
		 into a graveyard in another part of the city.
		-There, scattered about on the ground, there were an assortment of limp humanoid corpses,
		 studded liberally with small holes. D'Roc poked at one of them, and pronounced it boneless.
		-"Well, I guess we know what these skeleton things were made from," I said, pointing out the
		 obvious.
		-The scene seemed to trigger a memory for Maya, who described an old legend of Sasserine,
		 concerning an ancient temple in the city's catacombs, and horrible creatures that once
		 haunted it. Crucially, she knew where the temple was located, and began to lead us there.
	-Arriving where Maya said the ancient temple was located, D'Roc called a halt, saying he heard
	 heavy footfalls from somewhere ahead.
		-"Well, sounds like time to prepare yourselves," I said, manifesting Defensive Precognition.
		-My foresight in initiating my foresight was soon proved as, when we crept forward, a wide
		 variety of skeletal nightmares began to shamble out of various alcoves and perpendicular
		 tunnels, towards us.
			-There were towering pillars of bones, animated and continually shifting their shape,
			 shambling zombie-like humanoid forms, and a three headed skeletal horror brandishing
			 a staff of bones at us.
		-Quickly, one of the pillars shifted it's form into something like a rhinoceros and rushed
		 at D'Roc. I hurled some holy water at it as it got close, but it barely slowed, slamming
		 into our minotaur man and shoving him back against the wall of the tunnel.
		-The rest of the undead crept forward as Maya and Jade pelted them with various projectiles,
		 and the three-headed thing responded in kind by scooping up several bones from an adjcacent
		 tomb and hurling them, now wreathed in necromantic energy, at D'Roc, who winced.
		-Now enraged, D'Roc rushed forwards, ignoring the blows of nearby undead, and slamming,
		 horns first, into the staff-wielding skeleton, who seemed to be running the show.
		-That clearly did some damage, and so did Sarge, who incinerated the pillar-rhino-horror
		 that had slammed into D'Roc earlier, only to be slashed by a bone scythe wielded by
		 another.
		-Looking to avoid the same fate, I wisely applied another defensive power, Force Screen,
		 from the cover of an alcove in which I'd hidden myself.
		-Sarge had a more aggressive response, incinerating that pillar too, with a fiery ray,
		 before ducking into the alcove across from me.
		-A four-armed skeletal creature then lept out from an alcove behind D'Roc, slashing away
		 at his back, opening grevious wounds and causing him to collapse to the ground.
		-Maya and Jade then took shots at the three-headed commander. Maya's went wide, but Jade's
		 bane-charged crossbow bolt blasted shards from it's boney body.
		-D'Roc was remarkably still moving and, letting out a roar, he swung his great axe at his
		 attackers boney legs. He sheared off a foot, though the now-lopsided creature caught
		 itself on its newly shorn ankle and remained standing.
		-I leaned out from cover and shot the commander, lodging an arrow in its chest, as Sarge
		 ran forward and seared it too with another spell.
		-The shambling zombie creatures finally made it to the fray, entering the main tunnel from
		 two side tunnels and cutting D'Roc and Sarge off from the rest of us.
		-The three of us down South now focused on our new company, loosing various projectiles at
		 them (holy water from me, to good effect), as we lost sight of the fray further down the
		 tunnel.
		-Looks like up there was where the real action happened, as the creatures in front of us
		 suddenly crumbled to piles of rotting flesh, revealing Sarge standing over the smoldering
		 remains of the commander. . . and D'Roc's bloody, motionless form.
		-We rushed forward but Jade, reaching him first, examined his body and then looked up,
		 shaking her head.
		-Maya then called out, and sent her eldritch energies flying down the hall at a dwarf
		 dressed in lots of black and spikes, fleeing back the way we'd come.
		-Sarge and I joined in that, and soon the dwarf was lying on the ground, bloody but
		 breathing.
		-"Do we need him to talk?" I asked, as Jade, Maya, and I rushed towards the dwarf. "Do we
		  need to _make_ him talk?"
		-Maya reached him first, and began rummaging through his equipment. As she upended his
		 backpack, though, a ghostly form poured fourth, lashing out at Maya with one of it's arms.
		-Maya and I began to blast away at it, but Jade drew forth her magic orb, to which she'd
		 recently added a relevant tuning fork. Muttering an incantation, she bound the ghost,
		 holding it in place.
		-I asked Jade how long that would last and, when she responded, "Not long," I suggested
		 that Maya render it rather more permanently motionless.
		-She and Sarge began to blast away at it, and soon it had dissipated.
		-Jade mentioned that the rest of the place is probably worth searching, but suggested we
		 come back later, with D'Roc hopefully alive again.
		-She then conjured up a floating disc of force, to carry back our fallen comrade and our
		 captive, and we headed back the way we came.
	-We took D'Roc to a shrine in the Noble District, and there told our sad story to the presiding
	 priest.
		-Though sympathetic, especially owing to the noble cause D'Roc died for, they protested that
		 this was the last of their diamonds, and said that they would need us to replace them.
			-Shit that's going to run us 10 grand.
		-Jade was happy to agree and, soon, D'Roc was miraculously breathing again.
	-We then took a well deserved breather, resting at the Dracus estate and healing, before
	 returning the next day to the temple in the catacombs to search it.
		-We fortunately ran into no more living (or unliving) things, and found a bit more loot.
		-We also found a map, featuring arrows pointing to Sasserine's Northernmost bay, and with
		 ciphered writing.

4/19/23:
	-Jade poked around in the bag of holding that our captured necromancer had, the one a ghost had
	 come out of.
		-First, she threatened to eat it, should it cross us again, which seemed effective (I
		 _certainly_ believed she would).
		-That settled, she opened it up, and. . . found some ghostly furniture? Including a book
		 that named our ghost, Angmar, and described the sad tale of his banishment to this bag.
		-My more scholarly companions fell to discussing the matter in depth, but most of it was
		 over my head (and outside my concern about how much we could sell the thing for).
	-We also decided to interrogate our captive necromancer.
		-Maya was reluctant to bring him into her home, so we opted to handle the matter in a
		 convenient alley.
		-Still unconscious, we bound his hands.
			-Though, looking at him closely, he seemed a bit more like a goon than a priest.
		-I then prceeded to employ my healing belt, closing some of his wounds, and waking him up.
		-He indeed claimed to just be paid muscle for them, and had a sob story about a dead sister
		 the moritician's promised they could "get back" for him, but I thought he was full of shit.
		-Pressing him a bit, he admitted to being a bit more willing of a follower than just an
		 employee.
		-Pushing him harder, the most useful thing we got out of him was mention of some kind of
		 "flying bone fortress" made from an ancient dragon, due perhaps a couple of weeks from now.
		-There was also some mention of cultists with a "five-headed dragon" emblem, which had both
		 Sarge and Maya talking about "Tiamat".
			-Apparently she's some evil dragon goddess.
		-"I thought these morticians were _Nikisi_ followers, not Tiamat cultists," I muttered.
		 "They said something about an abandoned god?" our captive replied, "Or a god that abandoned
		  them? They were always going on about needing a god to find their god. . ."
		-He then tried to bargain for his freedom, a thing Sarge and Jade seemed in favor of, but
		 Maya wanted to turn him over to the guards, and I didn't much want to turn my back on him.
		-The "redeem him through service" faction seemed to win out but, as we began walking, Bram
		 pointed out he'd slipped his bonds and Maya slapped the _shit_ out of him, knocking him
		 off his feet and causing him to crack his head on the pavement.
		-I then spoke up and, with new evidence of our captive's perfidy in hand, the "turn him
		 into the guards" course of action won out.
		-I also again had to protest against Maya's suggestion that _I_ go with to turn the jerk in,
		 not being eager for the guards to know I'm back in the city.
	-I ended up finding myself a drink while I awaited their return.
		-I ordered some red wine at a nearby bar.
		-What I was served, though, _started_ red, but then the color began to change, shifting
		 through the spectrum.
		-I looked around for the bartender, intending to ask him what vintage this thing was, but
		 saw instead a group gnomes of at a nearby table, pointing and laughing.
		-I got up and approached them, asking, "Is this round on you, then?"
		-As I got close, though, I found I recognized them: it was the troup of entertainers from
		 Sharaar Kol.
		-We ordered a round of gnomish whiskey and got to talking.
			-They _were_ talking now, the miming being just part of the act, and introduced
			 themselves as Grimble, Thimble, and Dimble.
			-They were in town for the upcoming festival celebrating Sasserine's founding.
		-They had some time before that, though, and requested I show them around the city for a
		 bit.
		-I agreed, but said that first we'd need to collect some friends of mine.
	-I led the gnomes over to the nearby guard post, and waited for the rest of the party to emerge.
		-It was only a few moments before the emerged and a made some introductions to the gmomes,
		 who were currently forming a human (well, gnomish) pyramid.
		-They repeated to the others that they were in town for the coming festival.
		-"Well," I then said, "Want to get into some trouble in the meantime?"
		-Two of the gnomes replied that they needed to practice their routine, but Grimble was quite
		 confident, and demonstrated with some quick illusions. He opted to hang out with us a bit
		 while his companions returned to their wagon.
		-That left us to discuss what _our_ next move was, then.
			-Maya suggested an interesting idea: making me a masked hero, so I could lay claim to
			 my heroic deeds without getting arrested, and perform an eventual dramatic reveal.
			-I thought that sounded like a great plan, and the first step then was a costume.
			-We looked at each other and then, as one, all rushed to catch up with other gnomes,
			 yelling for their attention.
	-Joining the gnomes on their way back to their wagon, we set about doing some tailoring once we
	 got back there.
		-After some discussion, we settled on a persona: The Crimson Crusader, and his Crimson Crew!
		-They put together a wonderful crimson costume, with gold highlights, and matching outfits
		 for my crew.
			- +2 to Performance while wearing the outfits.
	-From there, we headed back to Maya's estate, for a late dinner and some rest.
		-There, we ate, drank, and discussed plans.
		-We need to address the Quickhammers, so we resolved to head back to Sharaar Kol, via the
		 teleport route, the next morning.
		-First, though, we wanted to addres our necromancer loot.
		-Then, we could take our airship back to Sasserine, giving Jade some crafting time.
		-There's also the matter of diamonds to resolve, but it occurred to us that Sharaar Kol
		 might be the perfect place to resolve that.
			-We have some miners we helped, or could, after dealing with the Quickhammers, request
			 payment from the king in diamonds.
	-Waking the next morning, we found everyone around the estate in unusually fine dress.
		-Asking some questions, we heard that Maya's father was holding some meetings that day,
		 with his fellow nobles, looking to do some. . . reorganization of the council.
		-Jade spoke of past votes of no confidence, in the Dawn Council, throughout the city's
		 history.
	-From the Dracus estate, we headed to the market, to unload our necromancer loot.
	-After that, it was on to The Bank of Sasserine.
		-As we approached, though, we ominously sighted a flying creature, circling the bank.
		-Swooping down and perching on the bank, it revealed itself to be a large black dragon, one
		 that announced, "The bank is closed! We have. . . business here."


5/3/23:
	-Joining the dragon perched atop the bank, a group of six dragonborn also approached the
	 building and took up position around it.
		-They all wore uniforms, which Maya claimed belonged to a group from the war, The 5th Arcane.
		-The city guard fell back, but an official from the bank emerged, shouting, "What is the
		 meaning of this?!?"
		-The dragon then swooped down and, facing the man, pronounced, "You have taken what is ours.
		 You have distributed what was not yours. Return it!"
			-I got the sense, though, that the dragon wasn't looking for a fight, but to accomplish
			 it's goal.
		-Conferring further with the official, the dragon demanded to see the bank's ledge, and
		 began pressing the official with questions concerning funds and particular accounts.
		-Sarge then walked up to the other dragonborn, the rest of us trailing behind him.
			-"Halt," one of them said. "I don't recognize you brother. . ."
			 "Yeah, it's been a while," Sarge replied. "What brings you here?"
			 "Our unit has been restored," the other dragonborn replied.
			 "You know these guys?" Bram asked Sarge.
			 "Not personally," Sarge said. "I was a member of the 6th."
			-Sarge and his kin then spoke about what they were doing there. His counterpart said
			 that, unlike what some of their fellows had chosen, there could be no peace until they
			 were victorious, and that their captain, gesturing towards the dragon, had something
			 taken from his hoard.
				-He referred to the dragon as "Fury Claw".
			-I gradually got an impression of "bank run" as the uniformed dragonborn we spoke with
			 said something about wanting _depositors_ to return funds to the bank, so that they
			 can have what's theirs.
			-I used that as an excuse, saying, "Huh. . . this is starting to sound like a bank run,
			 making it all the more urgent we look in on the vault _we_ came here to see. . ."
			-With Maya chiming in, we convinced the dragonborn to let us go into the bank, with him
			 shrugging, saying, "Well, the master can discuss the matter with you. . ."
		-We walked into the entrance of the bank, but the dragon landed behind us.
			-"The bank is closed," the creature pronounced, flapping his wing.
			-Maya, though responded in kind, flapping wings of her own.
			-The dragon stepped back, asking Maya, "The platinum one sent you?"
			-They fell to a discussion, one in which the dragon seemed willing to treat Maya as a
			 representative of Bahamut, a thing Maya played up with references to her "father" and
			 his authority, especially with her preference for discussion over violence. They
			 debated claims of territory, but the dragon eventually resorted to threats of violence,
			 spraying a gout of acid into the air.
			-Maya redirected that to a duel, mentioning the arena, and the dragon indeed challenged
			 her. Seizing on the _dragon_ issuing the challenge, Maya claimed her choice of weapons.
			-The dragon assented, and Maya chose. . . diplomacy. That prompted claims of cowardice,
			 cowardice he also accused Bahamut of (perhaps backing up her claimed backing). The
			 dragon, however, assented.
			-The fell to discussing exact terms, settling on _here_ as the venue and that, if Maya
			 won, he'd grant the bank leniency and time, though he'd not forego his claim to the
			 wealth he'd come for.
			-Maya then looked to me, asking, "Should we go forward with this?
			-I agreed, so she then asked, "You or me?
			-Taking her meaning, I agreed to serve as her champion in this.
		-The dragon and I then both saw to preparations.
			-The dragon had one of his dragon born bring forth a wand and, waving it in the air,
			 dusted his scales with sparkles.
				-Gimble whispered to me that he'd cast Glibness.
			-I then asked Grimble to round up an audience and, in an aside to the dragon, said I
			 needed to make preparations of my own. I looked for a handy office and did a wardrobe
			 change, into my Crimson Crusader outfit.
			-As I made ready to make my entrance, Maya hyped me up with a story of the exploits of
			 the Crimson Crusader, illustrated by (unfortunately somewhat awkward) illusions from
			 Grimble.
			-One of the dragonborn then served the same role for the true dragon, giving a speech
			 about how the people were not their enemy.
				-In response, D'Roc called out from the crowd, yelling, "Who is?"
				 "Those who have stolen ou land," the draconic soldier replied. "I think called
				  they're called The Sun Council?"
			-We then made our entrances, the dragon swooping dramatically into the open space before
			 the bank.
			-For mine, I called out to Grimble, yelling, "Lights!" Then, accompanied by a swirl of
			 dancing lights, I strode forth and struck a heroic pose in my Crimson Crusader outfit.
			-"Does he mean the 'stolen' land on which your homes sit?!?" I opened.
			 "Dragons will protect you, and your homes! Far better than this bumbling council. . ."
			  the dragon rejoined, his scales glittering.
			-The crowd dismayingly seemed to buy that, so I pointed out that, "Things were going
			 just fine until dragons got involved! Remember the necromancers? You saw their dragon!"
				-"They're followers of Tiamat!" May called out from the crowd. "_I_ saw their white
				  dragon, Tiamat's child!"
			-"Dragons will _protect_ the people, and put an end to this chaos!" the dragon reiterated.
			 "You could have stepped in at any time. . ." I replied. "You claim the council steals,
			  but _you_ are the one that comes here only now, blocking access to the bank and
			  demanding it's wealth!
			-One of the dragon's followers then brought forth ancient, runic document. "This is the
			 evidence of my claim!" the dragon called out, brandishing it. "You speak of a
			 founder's day, but _this_ is the true deed of the city!"
			-Maya and Jade rushed forward to inspect it, but I said, "I don't speak such ancient
			 gibberish. What _I_ know is the good people of this city, standing here before me!"
				-They whispered to me, saying that's no deed.
			-"Ha! My experts, natives of this fair city tell me he lies! That is not what he claims
			  it is! The thief here is _this_ beast!"
			-Seeing the crowd turn on him, the dragon unleashed a burst of acid into the air above
			 us in frustration. He and his dragonborn then took wing. As he did so, he shouted,
			 "Might will eventually settle this!
			-I was busy, though, basking in the adulation of the crowd, shouting for more.
			-After a moment, though, I turned to my fellows, saying, "Time, I think, for our
			 dramatic exit. Always leave the crowd wanting more. . ."
			-We made our way back into the bank, and, with the help of a clerk, found our way to
			 the vault holding our way back to Sharaar Kol.
				-Employing the combination we were instructed to use, we opened the vault and found
				 our portal.
	-Passing through the portal, we found ourselves in a dark warehouse, our Sharaar-Kol-isused
	 again glowing green.
		-Which all of us possessed save D'Roc, posing something of an issue, as we peered out the
		 door revealing we were in the _lower_ city. . .
		-Grimble volunteered a solution, though, and rendered D'Roc invisible, though he warned it
		 would only last a few minutes.
		-We quickly made our way out onto the streets, but found them crowded with many dwarves
		 going about their business.
		-Maya tried to make a path for our enormous invisible companion, but he bumped a dwarf
		 as he was making his way into the elevator.
		-"Wha. . . what was that?!?" the dwarf exclaimed, groping about. ". . . a ghost?"
		-At that, the other dwarves about all took battle stances, getting ready for trouble.
		-Sarge, though, shouted, "Stand back! We've got this. . ."
		 "Yeah," I chimed in. "We have undead experience. . ."
		-We ushered the dwarves away from the elevator, and piled into it our selves, engaging the
		 doors.
		-The ride up was long, and D'Roc's invisibility expired during it.
		-"I've got this," Grimble volunteered. "When the elevator stops, just give me a distraction!"
		-When it did so, I immediately rushed out the opening door, yelling, "Out of my way! Your
		 dwarven drinks are strong! I need a privy! Give me space!"
		-All eyes on me, Grimble recast invisibility.
		-As I ran off to make heaving noises in a nearby alley, the guards turned back to the
		 elevator, and I heard them ask, "There was word about some kind of ghost?"
		 "We took care of it," Sarge reassured them.
	-Getting out of sight before D'Roc reappeared, we then went to find our wizard "friend".
		-Asking around, we found him selling magical trinkets at a stand in the market.
		-Approaching him, Maya greeted him and said, "Our work is done?"
		 "Oh? How did you manage it?"
		 "We persuaded him to pursue a mutually advantageous course of action," I butted in. "We
		  should talk with our mutual friends. . ."
		 "Ah. Something truely horrible, eh? Well, they'll be at the pub across the street in an
		  hour."
	-We took our leave and had some fun in the pub in the meantime, Maya doing some dwarven dancing,
	 until some familiar faces arrived, sitting down at another table.
		-Shortly thereafter, I heard a familiar voice in my head, and, given the start most of the
		 others gave, they clearly heard the same. Another messaging spell. . .
		-"Who's this?" the voice asked, presumably referring to our enormous horned companion.
		 "Muscle," Maya replied.
		 "Ah. Always handy. . . Is the business done, then?"
		 "Yes, the matter is resolved," I informed our discrete associates.
		 "Good, good. Tip your bartender well. . . Don't worry. He's on the payroll."
		-Maya did so, eliciting a smile and nod from a barkeep.
		-"With that settled," the voice continued, "We have more business for you. There's a
		 festival coming up in Sasserine. It's the perfect chance to seize power."
		 "Ah, the Founder's Day celebration," I responded.
		 "Yes. And we'll need some people centrally located."
		-". . . We'll consider that," Maya eventually replied. "But we need to know more. More
		  about our associates, and what's in it for us."
		 "Power. You could be staying in the royal apartments at the end of this if you want."
		-A lot of discussion ensued, with us continually pressing to know our associates better.
		-Eventually, they relented, and said we should meet them in the alley from before, an hour
		 from now.
		-We agreed and they left, and I then suggested we get a room to relax. . . and discuss
		 future business.
	-We decided to goback to the first hotel we stayed at in Sharaar Kol, it being fancy and,
	 crucially, less likely to be under the control of our adversaries.
		-There we discussed a plan to reach the Quickhammer organization's leadership. First
		 diplomacy, then threats of blackmail with the info we had and the king's interst, then
		 beat it out of them.
		-We also discussed magical enhancement. Grimble suggested copying the dragon's appraoch, so
		 we went to find our wizard associate, who volunteered our requested Scroll of Glibness
		 free of charge, given our good work together.
		-As it got near the meeting time, Jade set up some infusions, I cast the scroll, and then
		 we were ready to go.
	-As we headed down to the lobby, something on the hotel's wall of hunting trophy's caught
	 D'Roc's attention: a set of mounted horns. . .
		-He called Maya over to read the inscription, and she said it came from "The Maze of
		 Memories", some 300 years ago.
		-D'Roc reached out to touch it, and seemed lost in thought for a few moments.
	-We also made a quick detour to a guard post, to get D'Roc a proper badge for the lower city.
	-Eventually, we went down to the alley, and were there ushered inside a nearby warehouse.
		-One of the dwarf's from before explained more details of their plan for Sasserine,
		 describing a "device" they wanted us to bring to the city.
		-"What's in it for us?" I asked.
		 "The city's royal apartments and everything in them," he replied. "That's worth more gold
		  than you'll know what to do with."
		 "Having gold isn't the same as keeping it," I responded. "We need to know who we're
		  working with, who we're putting in power, if we hope to do that."
		 "Very well," he said, and went off through an interior door.
		-He returned with an older dwarf, expensively dressed, who introduced himself, saying, "I'm
		  Vulkan, but you know me as Quickhammer."
		 "A pleasure to make your acquaintance," I replied. "I'm Fred the Red."
		-"The nobles of Sasserine are greedy," he began. "Their "legal coup", it's nothing. We have
		  enough of their lot in our pockets to make the difference. Like the dredgers. . . Don't
		  need folks seeing what's in the canals. . ."
		 "The Shapers are a mess," he continued, "And the undead too attention-grabbing. They
		  attract the self-righteous. The city is ripe for our taking."
		-"What about the new gang?" Maya asked.
		 "What new gang?" he replied.
	     "The dragons," I broke in. "One showed up with a bunch of dragonborn just today, demanding
		  money he was 'owed' a the bank."
		 "Ah, you lot, eh?" he said, turning to Sarge. "I hear the transformation awakens. . . an
		  ancient stirring. . ."
		 "I know just what you mean. . ." Sarge replied.
		 "Well, it won't matter after this," Vulkan said, gesturing to one of his men.
		-The dwarf left the room, and then return shortly with a handheld case, glowing brightly
		 with barely contained evocation magic. He also handed me a wand,
		-"That's a Wand of Sending", Vulkan explained. "You'll issue the command word to the device
		  with that. It's. . ." he said, uttering something in dwarvish that I paid little attention
		 to.
		 "Set it off in the center of the city," he continued, "During the big speech."
		-Maya then asked about how we'd returned to the city, and pressed for a list of portals,
		 getting a location in a betting parlor near the arena and one in a magic shop in the market
		 district.
			-"We should see our wizard friend for that, then? I asked.
			 "Yes," Vulkan simply replied.
		-Looking to my companions, several of who were poorly hiding their discomfort, I then said,
		 "We have a deal.
		-I grabbed the device and turned to my companions, saying, "Lets go folks," and then turned
		 to leave.
		-Once we were all out the door, I began whispering, saying, "This is our chance. Grimble,
		 give me some dwarven guards on the street."
		-As he began casting an illusion, I tossed the wand to Jade, saying, "Send the king a
		 message. Have him send the guards."
		-As the illusionary guards appeared, I ran back into the building, yelling, "The guards are
		 here! We need another way out!"
			-It was the performance of my life. (Rolled a 20, for 71 with Glibness!)
		-The Quickhammers began scrambling, and Maya ran into the building too, _conveniently_
		 stumbling into Vulkan, knocking them both over and tangling the two of them in her
		 elaborate gown.
		-Grimble then rushed in, and past them, shouting, "I'll stop the guards, and grease the door!"
		-He indeed cast Grease, _conveniently_ including, the tangle of Vulkan and Maya in the area,
		 along with another dwarf or two.
		-Sarge then ran in, sliding across the grease and bowling over another two dwarves.
		-From outside the door, D'Roc began a thoroughly unconvincing fake battle with the fake
		 guards with some stilted dialogue, but his roar was still enough to send shivers down the
		 spine and the dwarves scrambling.
		-Reasonably quickly, and before Vulkan could find his feet, the guards arrived, shouting
		 into the building that they had the place surrounded.
		-I rushed out with my hands up, to find Jade already explaining the situation to the guards.
			-I joined her in that as soon as I was out of sight of the doorway, and I heard Maya
			 begin to spill the whole story to the first guard through the door, while "surrendering"
			 herself.
	-Our party and the dwarves were soon hauled off to jail in chains, though the guards soon
	 released us once we were out of sight of the gang members.
		-We were soon joined by King Kumara, to whom we quickly explained that we'd captured a large
		 share of the Quickhammer organization's leadership, along with a sinister device of their
		 manufactur, and relayed to him their plot for Sasserine.
		-We were rewarded fairly well, per captured gangmember, and then rushed off, explaining that
		 there were several others we could roll up before word spread.


TODO:
	-Roll up more Quickhammers before word spreads too much.
		-The wizard who teleported us?
		-The ~25 agents in Sasserine?
		-The barkeep that took the payment for the gambling debt?


6/28/23:
	-We took a quick moment to discuss our next move, how we address the remaining Quickhammers we
	 know about.
		-We opted to address the barkeeper and wizard first, they being in Sharaar Kol with us.
		-We also talked with the guard captain, about what we'd need to do to successfuly
		 incriminate these folks. He indicated they'd need to be caught in the act, confess, or at
		 least some witnesses (us?) willing to testify under a zone of truth.
			-We also recalled he was at least somewhat corrupt, and were a bit cagey about who our
			 targets were.
			-He was also able to detail some guards to wait for our signal at locations of our
			 choice, and to provide some arcane marked gold.
				-That last should help with the barkeep, he being mostly guilty of receiving funds
				 for the organization.
			-The wizard did teleportation for the organization, and asking for more of that might
			 both incriminate him _and_ provide a fast route back to Sasserine.
		-We decided to split up, Jade, Grimble, and I handling the wizard, and delaying him as long
		 as possible, for the rest to eventually join us after taking care of the barkeep.
			-If we could keep the wizard busy long enough, the others would then be able to join
			 us there for the teleport.
	-A rough plan in place, we put it into action.
		-My group went looking for the wizard first at his room in the inn, given the late our,
		 instructing our delegated guards to outside the inn, and to follow us at a discrete
		 distance if he led us elsewhere.
			-Meanwhile, the rest went off to see the barkeep.
		-Going up into the inn, I banged on the wizard's door several times with no response,
		 though I could hear snoring coming from within.
			-Eventually, I resorted to jimmying the lock, and entering.
			-When I did, though, a blaring alarm went off and I was encased in some kind of magical
			 sphere.
				-Grimble and Jade fortunately hopped back and dodged that undignified fate.
			-That at least woke the damned wizard.
			-I couldn't hear anything inside my sphere, nor did they appear to be hearing my
			 profane complaints. I could see Jade and the wizard talking, though, hopefully
			 negotiating my release.
				-Jade wandered off, which was distressing, but returned with a goblet of wine in
				 hand, and turned it over to the wizard.
				-The wizard chugged it, rubbed his eyes, and finally released me.
			-After dusting myself off, I launched into my story, telling him that our "quick"
			 meeting with our "mutual friends" was interrupted by some guards, and that we were
			 looking for a quick exit once the rest of our friends managed to get here.
			-He seemed to buy it, but both wanted to come with and didn't want to wait on the rest
			 of our crew.
			-We eventually talked him into that last, and he asked us to wait down in the common
			 room.
			-We didn't even make it down the stairs, though, when he called for us, yelling, "Shit!
			 Get back up here!"
			-Running back up, we saw him holding some kind of crystal, and he said, "I can't
			 contact the boss!
			 "Shit," I replied. "Think they grabbed him?"
			 "Yeah. We need to get our of here. Now. Grab my hand!"
			-Thinking fast, I said, "Wait one moment more! I can try contacting the rest of my
			 crew. . ." I then began to manifest a power, in a decidedly exagerated fashion,
			 holding my fingers to my temples and squinting hard.
			-The power I manifested, though, was Brain Lock, but it sadly failed, alerting the
			 wizard to our treachery.
			-He then began to cast a spell, but I resorted to the simple expedient of stabbing him
			 with my rapier, which disrupted his spell.
			-He began another spell then, but I stabbed him again, this time with my brain, and he
			 went down, bleeding from his nose.
			-Jade quickly grabbed his magic crystal.
			-Poking him with the toe of my boot, he still seemed to be _alive_, so Jade began to
			 heal him with her belt, while I bound and gagged him and Grimble retrieved his spell
			 component pouch.
			-His eyes fluttered open, and Jade and I began to threaten him, aided by her cocked
			 crossbow.
				-His response was distressed, gagged mumbling, but it seemed like he got the
				 message.
			-I then contacted our waiting guards, and Jade began to examine the crystal with her
			 monacle.
			-The guards arrived a short while later, and I reported, saying, "We captured him. Not
			 much luck baiting him into anything, but you've at least got three witnesses here!"
			-They led him off, and we went down to the bar, to wait for our friends and for some
			 gnomish whiskey.
	-Eventually, the others arrived in the inn's common room, before we were too drunk even.
		-They reported substantial success on their end, and we let them know we got the wizard too,
		 albeit without managing to wait for a free teleport.
	-Given no teleport, we opted to head back to Sasserine aboard our original airship.
		-Maya wondered if there might be something we could do to induce the elementals to help us
		 travel faster, and Sarge suggested he can cast the Gust of Wind spell, which might help.
			-Jake said it would increase speed by 50% for an hour per casting.
		-Along the way back to the ship, we stopped by the palace, to leave word for the king.
			-Speaking with a seneschal, we let him know we were heading back to Sasserine to
			 address the Quickhammer agents there, and that we could be reached through Lord Dracus,
			 should we not be back by the trials of those captured here.
		-Back aboard the ship, we took flight and, with the assistance of the spells, got to
		 Sasserine in only a day.
			-The spells indeed speeded things up dramatically, but the ship also creaked rather
			 worringly.
			-We suspected the ship may need some maintenance after this, and Jade said she could
			 look into that.
			-Oh! Shit, didn't we sort of steal our ship back when last we had it docked in
			 Sasserine? We might have some issues at the docks. . .
				-Though Maya at least reached out to her father ahead of time, via the book, to
				 hopefully smooth things over.


7/12/23:
	-I missed this session, owing to my honeymoon.
	-Fred spent the session back at the ship, bottle in hand, chatting with the ship's bound air
	 elementals.
		-Some were distinctly resentful of their situation, but others seemed to appreciate the
		 sense of purpose.
			-"Purpose is all well and good. . . *burp* . . . but better one you _picked_ than this
		     shit. . ."
		-I also noticed Rusty humming a tune.
			-I commented that I didn't know he was musically inclined, and asked if he knew anything
			 dancier.
			-Apparently he knew just the one tune, though, a marching song used by his unit.
	-The rest of the party ran off into the city, intent on tracking down more Quickhammer agents.


8/2/23:
	-Wandering up on deck with Rusty and Grimble, we spotted the rest of the party on their way
	 back to the ship.
		-As they boarded, Jade introduced us to her cohort, Bruce, a vaguely-humanoid albino bat,
		 who's also a druid.
		-They'd also apparently addressed some kind of Quickhammer plot in a warehouse in the city,
		 though they were skeptical that there was any evidence in hand with which to claim a bounty
		 back in Sharaar Kol. But, at least they're not sabotaging things in Sasserine now.
			-They mentioned they'd brought back some kind of mirror from that too.
		-Maya also pointed out a newly arrived ship, a richly decorated elven airship.
			-She said that it belong to some elven nobles from a distant region.
			-She said they were somewhat less cosmopolitan than her family, but that she knew a few
			 from a party hosted by her father many years ago.
			-She had stopped by the ship briefly and spoken with it's guards.
		-Maya had also been thinking more about that orb, supposedly sunken in the city's canals.
			-She had that vision of demon prince, and some connection between the orb and The Abyss,
			 and had begun to wonder if that demon was influencing the city's gangs, causing some
			 of the recent chaos and pushing them to recover the orb.
			-She refused to name the demon prince, though, saying it's name caused madness, and she
			 even seemed to have some kind of. . . episode, at the mere thought.
				-She stumbled a bit, grabbing Sarge's shoulder to steady herself, and Bruce, staring
				 at the side of her head, exclaimed, "What in The Hells, lady?" apparently seeing
				 something I did not.
				-In a moment, though, we _all_ noticed something wrong, as the ship suddenly dropped
				 60 feet, from where it had been hovering alongside the dock.
				-We all grabbed for the rails and hung on, save Sarge who took wing, until the drop
				 stopped as suddenly as it had started.
				-Sarge glided down to the deck, and commented that he'd also noticed some of his
				 enchanted items briefly stop working. He speculated that there may have been a
				 brief antimagic field in effect.
				-The more arcane educated among us began debating what happened, eventually arriving
				 at the conclusion that Maya mangled a truename, resulting in some kind of wild magic.
				-Investigating further, the antimagic field still seemed to be in effect, above us
				 in the berth the ship had been docked in.
				-"Uh," I said, "Some one less. . . _popular_, with the guards, than me should
				 probably warn folks about that, or there might be some accidents. . ."
				-Jade suggested a dockside merchants' alliance that could probably handle that,
				 without asking as many. . . pointed questions as the city guard would.
				-We also needed to see about arranging a new berth, and, looking around, the docks
				 were awfully full.
				-We brought the ship up above a different section of the docks and lowered Jade,
				 via a rope, while Sarge and Maya flew down.
				-We'd attracted quite a bit of attention, though, and people began shouting up to us,
				 asking what happened.
					-"Beats me!" I shouted back down. "What kind of shoddy docks are they running
					 here?"
					-That started something of a panic, as the crowd ran about, looking to check
					 their own ships and asking if theirs were in danger too.
					-Jade, though, caught their attention and said she thought it might be just the
					 one ship.
					-Maya chimed in, too, adding that she thought it might have been those
					 Quickhammers. "They've been after us for a while. . . though the king of
					 Sharaar Kol is offering a bounty for their capture."
					-The crowd then began staring at the lone dwarf there, who, after a moment,
					 shouted, "Hey! I'm not one of them!"
				-Jade and Maya then hurried off to speak with that merchant's group.
				-Shortly thereafter, some dockworkers came out to our former berth and stretched a
				 yellow rope across it, hanging signs from it that said "Caution".
				-When they returned, I asked them how it went, and they said well enough.
					-Bruce, though, slightly admonished me, saying, "You didn't mention you had a
					 second identity, Mr. Crimson Crusdader. . ."
					 "Ahhh. . ." I responded, "Yeah, you might not want to mention the name Fred
					 around town. I'm a bit. . . popular here, especially with the guards. . ."
	-After that, we had Rusty keep an eye on the ship, hovering near the docks now, while all the
	 rest of us, save Maya, went with Jade to her orphanage, as she mentioned some business to take
	 care of there.
		-Maya had a headache, and needed to rest a bit.
		-Once back there, Bruce quickly flapped his way inside, greeting the residents.
		-Bruce and Jade then began discussing the orphans' studies, leading me to grow bored quite
		 rapidly.
		-I eventually interjected, saying, "History class bored me back home, and here's no
		 different. I've got some tailoring to have done. Grimble and I are going to go talk to his
		 kin about that. Meet you all back at the ship?"
		-I got some nods, so we headed back out to the street.
	-So Grimble and I indeed went to visit his kin in their wagon.
		-After some greetings, Grimble and I laid out our plan: a harness to strap him, while
		 affected by Reduce Person, to my chest.
		-They immediately got what I was going for, and we all began riffing on goofy thing it would
		 let the two of us do.
		-We ran out to buy materials, and they introduced me to a leatherworker they'd commissioned
		 some stuff from before, and soon we were putting together the harness, complete with some
		 red enameled buckles and stitched crimson C's, to complement my Crimson Crusader outfit.


8/9/23:
	-We're now a few days away from the Founder's Day festival.
		-The guards have been recruiting, and there's quite a bit more of them on the streets then
		 usual, though many of them look young and green.
	-D'Roc found me at the festival grounds, hanging around the gnomes' wagon and trying out my new
	 Grimble harness.
		-He'd been napping below decks when the ship plummeted (and Bram was busy for the last
		 session) and, in the chaos surrounding that, we never went to wake him. Evidentally, he's
		 a heavy sleeper. . .
		-I demonstrated my new harness, shouting, "Say hello to my little friend!" as I spun to
		 greet him, showing off the tiny, giggling gnome strapped to my chest.
		-After laughing at that for a bit, he asked me about the others and I let him know they
		 were back at Jade's orphanage.
	-Being all finished adjusting the harness, I agreed with D'Roc when he suggested we find the
	 others, and we headed back to the orphanage.
	-We ran into them as they were heading out.
		-I asked them where they were off to, and Maya said she wanted to look in on the
		 taxidermist's guild again, it having been some time since we raided the place, to make
		 sure they're not up to more trouble.
		-"Oh yeah! They were in bed with the necromancers right? Or was it some other gang?"
		 "It was the Lotusdr. . ." Maya began.
		 "Ah! Yeah, that lady's dickhead brother! Right!" I interjected. "Well, I'm up for looking
		  for more trouble. . . Though, I'd like to look at doing some work on our ships too. Check
		  up on our goblins, maybe start work repairing those cannons. . . Oh! That reminds me! Know
		  anywhere that I can get dwarven booze? I forgot to get the goblins a souvenir. . ."
		 "Well," Maya replied, "I know a bar near the guild _run_ by a dwarf. Maybe he's got some. . ."
		 "Good enough for me!"
	-We swung by the taxidermist's guild, where Maya negotiated with a confused clerk to have a bloody
	 mouse corpse skeletonized and mounted for her.
		-Seemed a bit outside what they'd normally do, but Maya was paying well, and he agreed.
	-"Well, how about that bar, then? Which way, May?" I asked.
	 "Oh! This way! It's the Lusty Leopard. . . You remember it, right?" she said.
	 "Hmm. . . I remember starting some _trouble_ there. . ." I replied. "You might need to run
	  inside for me, Maya. I don't need any angry lepers after me. . ."
	 "Sure!"
		-Maya and the rest of the party indeed ran inside for me, and came out a short while later
		 with two casks of ale, carried by D'Roc.
	-"Well! With that settled, lets go see the goblins!" I said, "Been a while since we checked on
	  them. . . I think we left their ship anchored above that trash island. . ."
		-We decided to take our original airship over, as I suggest we might need to transfer those
		 cannons to it.
	-As we pulled up to the island, we saw many more goblins than I recall us leaving there.
		-Our green recruits had been joined by nearly a hundred of their kin on the island below
		 them.
		-The new goblins were hurling grappling hooks up to the ship above them and attempting to
		 climb aboard while our buddies frantically ran around the ship cutting their lines.
		-Seeing our ship, Squee called out to us, yelling, "You're back!"
		-Observing the scene, I said, "I. . . don't remember that many goblins. Well, ready for
		 trouble, folks?"
		-Grimble nodded in response, and began casting Mage Armor.
		-I then turned to Sarge and said, "I think we might need to demonstrate some artillery. Care
		 to do the honors?"
			-Seeing dragon-man's smile in response was quite the toothy sight.
		-Maya proceeded to launch into a speech, the crescendo of which Sarge punctuated with a
		 fireball launched into the massed goblins below.
		-Many of the goblins went flying, and the rest began to scatter. One that appeared to be
		 some kind of leader began yelling at the rest, waving a stick that periodically shot a
		 glowing projectile into the air.
		-Maya then leaned over the side and, with her Eldritch Blast, shot the stick from the
		 goblin's hand.
		-That proved to be the last straw (stick?), and the goblins below fled the island, swimming
		 off or launching some ramshackle boats.
	-That settled, we pulled our airship alongsided the other and tossed lines over to pull them
	 tight.
		-"Squee!" I called out, as we clambered aboard the other ship. "Looks like we got here just
		  in time!"
		 "We. . . we've been fighting them for. . . I don't know," he replied, and I could see that
		 his eyes were bloodshot and hear the exhaustion in his voice.
		 "Well. . . better late than never, I guess!" I said.
		-"I brought you some souvenirs," I continued, gesturing to the casks on the other ships,
		 "But I guess our arrival at this mess renders that just gravy. . . Well, D'Roc, mind
		  helping haul the casks aboard anyways?"
		-We got the casks aboard, but the goblins, for the moment at least, were more excited by
		 some sleep, and trudged off below decks to get it.
		-As my next order of business, I led the party down to the gun deck.
			-"Jade," I began, gesturing to the cannons, "This is what I'd been hoping to talk to
			  you about. What would we need to do to get these back into service?"
			-She spent some time looking over them and then reported that, "The cannon balls are
			 useable, as the rust on them won't harm anything, and there are 46 of them. The powder
			 is wet and ruined. Half of the cannons would be salvageable."
				-There's three salvageable cannons, and they're the light bombards from Stormwrack (pg. 103).
					-In materials, with a discount on the standard "Repairing Items" rules for some
					 spells from Grimble and Jade, repairing all three will cost 1,050 gp. 
						-We did some shopping and I deducted that from the ship's account.
				-The other three are unsalvageable, though it might be possible to sell them for
				 scrap.
			-Grimble then chimed in saying, "I can make smokepowder. It retails for 25 gp. per
			 pound, but I can make it for a third that in materials. Four pounds should suffice to
			 fire one of these cannons, or an ounce for some kind of handheld weapon. . ."
			-"Well. . ." I replied, "Sounds like a plan! As a start, lets get the repairable
			 cannons over to the other ship. . .
			 I paused, then, to look around and ensure our goblins weren't about, "It's less
			 ramshackle. . .
			-D'Roc tried lifting one cannon, but, after getting only one wheel off the ground, he
			 requested some help. We called Rusty over and, with me lending a hand as well, we
			 eventually lugged them over.
			-My ship was already set up for cannons, with two gun ports on either side of the ship,
			 so we gave her a mean right hook, with two cannons on the right side and one on the
			 left.
	-"Given these expenses, some paying work might be nice," Jade commented
		-"Too bad Sasserine isn't at war," Maya said, "A letter of marque would be nice. Sasserine
		  is sort of in a state of _civil_ war, but. . ."
		 "There's an ongoin gwar between Karhoon Tor and Tzarvan Keep," Sarge volunteered. "They're
		  fighting over the sacred woodlands between them.
			-Jade knew of the area, and said that there are old shrines in the wood, at which
			 powerful spirits reside and where treants were made
			-"Tzarvan Keep recently got a new king," Sarge added, "He promised an end to the war,
			  but he has thus far failed to deliver."
			-"How far is this?" I asked. "Leaving Sasserine _too_ long might be risky, with that
			  bone fortress due a week and a half from now. "
			 "We could be there in six days, or three with some magical boosting," Sarge replied.
		-"Well, closer to home," Maya said, "We could hunt Shapers? I'm sure I could find further
		  bounties. . ."
		 "Yeah, sounds good to me!" I replied. "If you can't join them, beat them (and no one
		  wanted to be cat people with me. . .). Plus, I've still got a Forcas-flavored score to
		  settle with them!"


8/23/23:
	-Maya set about working her connections, to get us some bounties for acting as lycanthrope
	 exterminators.
		-She came back with a contract from The Dawn Council, offering 100 gp. per head.
		-Bit cheap, but I do have a personal grudge anyways.
		-It also had a clause about proving they were members.
			-Maya, though, thankfully had heard some things about the gang. Apparently they
			 generally spread lycanthropy via an injection, one that leaves a distinctive mark.
			-It's usually done behind one ear.
			-Well, that certainly offers convenient proof.
	-In discussing that, we also wound up talking about Lady Lavinia's jackass brother.
		-Maya had some unusually bloodthirsty feelings towards him.
		-I pointed out that there's not a price on _his_ head, but Maya retorted that he was
		 rumored to have run off with the family fortune, so there might still be some profit in
		 the endeavor.
	-We decided to focus on the Shapers for the moment.
	-The apothecary we'd bought our wolf's bane from had mentioned they'd taken over the grounds of
	 the old observatory in The Shadow Shore, so we opted to go see her again.
		-Crossing the city and walking into her shop, we saw her engaged in a discussion with a
		 very pale elf.
			-He was wearing expensive clothes, but also a strange cloak over it, one with bones
			 woven into the fabric.
		-It seems he was looking to unload some kind of reagent, but she wasn't buying.
		-He began to storm out, but I stopped him and asked, "What are you selling, friend?
		  Aphrodesiacs?"
		-He paused at my question, and turned to show me some salvaged mostly-trash. Didn't look
		 like much fun, and so I began to wave him off.
		-He then inquired, though, if we'd be interested in an "air sensor", which certainly piqued
		 my interest, and mentioned he'd salvaged that from the same ship.
		-I asked him what he was asking for it, and he replied, not cash, but perhaps some help
		 getting acclimated to this city, he being a newcomer. He inquired about room and board,
		 while learning about the city.
		-I was open to that, and asked him, "What line of work are you in, friend, when not
		 peddling. . . stuff, to shopkeeps?"
		 "I am a scholar," he replied.
		 "Oh! You'll get a long well with Jade and Maya, then! They've got the bulk of our book
		  learning. I'm more of, well, lets call me an entertainer." Glancing down at my colorful
		 garb, I added, "Shit, that makes me sound like a pimp or something."
		 "What sort of scholar?" Jade asked.
		 "Of the only thing the matters," he replied, "The Dream."
		-That last seemed to catch Jade's attention. "What 'dream' do you mean?" she asked.
		 "The only dream that matters," he replied. "That of my home city, Otrok, the Unchanging."
		 ". . . I've been there," Jade replied, "In, well, a dream. . ."
		 "It is as real in a dream," the elf said, "As when walking it's streets in the flesh. It
		  is the reward that awaits all of us, in the end."
		 "What sort of reward?" Sarge broke in.
		 "The reward at the end of this life of suffering," he replied.
		 "Ho! You're doing it wrong, then," I said. "I could show you a good time. . . Wait, now I
		  sound like a pimp again. . ."
		-Seeming no more than slightly put off at my phrasing, the elf continued, "This life is
		  suffering, with the spots of happiness in between making it only the more crushing."
		 "You're definitely doing it wrong," Maya replied.
		 "Yeah," I said. "I find the hangover is almost always worth the fun."
		 "Hmph. Well, perhaps you can show me," he said, sounding doubtful. "Here, take this,"
		 he continued, thrusting his "air sensor" forward to me. "In exchange, give me room and
		  board, and help me learn about this city."
		-Turning the thing over in my hands, I briefly examined the strange object, before turning
		 it over to Jade, saying, "What do you think, Jade? This looks like your kind of thing. . ."
			-Jade looked over the object, and held it up for the others to examine.
			-Sarge pointed out that the script on a portion of it was an old elven dialect, the
			 elves having been responsible for a lot of early airship technology.
			-Jade pointed it at various objects around the shop, and at us, muttering about varying
			 "readings" as the dials on the surface of it moved as it did.
			-She even pulled out the strange orb we'd obtained, the one associated with The
			 Brotherhood, and pointed the device at it. The dials quickly went crazy, their needles
			 moving rapidly or pointing to extremes.
			-_That_ caught the elf's attention, and he asked, "What is that thing?"
			-Jade was evasive, saying, "Well, we don't _really_ know. . . It's not complete. . .
			  and I'm trying to learn about how it works. . ."
			-He narrowed his eyes, but remained silent.
		-That sorted, we turned to the shop's proprietor and got some wolf's bane for Sarge and
		 D'Roc.
			-While they were discussing that, I turned to the elf, saying, "Oh! We never had a
			 proper introduction! I'm Fred. Shit! Uh, Fed. . . that's what I said. . ."
			 "Skye," he said, cutting off my fumbling.
			 "Well, Skye, we should probably get some wolf's bane for you as well," I said. "Unless
			  you fancy growing some fur. . .
			-He agreed, and bought some for himself as well.
		-"Can't be too careful," I said to the proprietor, as we settled the transaction. "Still
		  have those lycanthropes lurking about."
		 "Yeah, they're all over," she replied.
		 "Oh!" I said, not at all forced, "When we were last here, you said something about them
		  causing you to have trouble gathering herbs? Something about an old observatory?"
		 "Yeah. I haven't been back since they infested the place. It's part of the reason the
		  wolf's bane is so expensive."
		 "If you want, we could play exterminator," I volunteered.
		 "Oh! Well, I don't have much cash on hand. . . But, perhaps a trade? Some of my stock in
		  return for clearing the observatory grounds," the shopkeep offered.
		 "Well, we do take on a lot of these. . . exterminator gigs," I said. "Potions certainly
		  would be helpful. . ."
		 "Say 500 gp. worth of stock each?" she said.
		 "A princely sum. . . Sure, you've got a deal!" I agreed. "We'll be back to let you know
		  how it turned out. Or, well, if we don't come back, you'll know how it turned out. . ."
		 "I suppose so. . . If you take that one," she said, gesturing to Skye, "You might come
		  back without muscles. . ."
		-That elicited quite the glare from Skye.
		-"Uh. . . Well, you're certainly welcome along, Skye," I said, "If you don't mind starting
		  your tour of the city with the seedier bits."
		 "Anything to get out of this place," he replied, with another glare at the proprietor.
		 "Well, lets head out, I guess!"
	-We made our way over to the observatory, a short walk away, and arrived at a rusty,
	 ivy-covered gate, behind which, on a rocky outcropping, lay a decrepit observatory.
		-"What is it we've come here for?" Skye asked.
		 "The grounds are supposed to be full of various lycanthropes," I replied. "That shopkeep
		  is our source, but she's paying us to get rid of them, so seems confident. Plus, we've
		  got a bit of a grudge against them, _and_ a contract with the city's council that pays
		  per head, so it seems like a good opportunity."
		-He nodded in response, unlimbered his longbow and began to check his arrows.
		-"Yep, that's the right idea," I said. "We should all make our preparations. Also, a plan
		  wouldn't be a bad idea. We've run into. . . some issues, in the past, on that front."
		-Grimble, at least, nodded, and began casting Mage Armor, while I loosened my rapier in
		 it's scabbard.
		-Sarge, meanwhile, began to wave his hand wildly, but none of us took his meaning, at least
		 until the trees inside the gate began to shake, and we saw large (for rats) rat-like shapes
		 moving among their branches. . .
			-Maya quickly loosed one of her eldritch blasts, but the shot went wide.
			-Grimble, though, then stepped forward and conjured a burst of fire in one of the trees,
			 from which fell a burning, but still moving, rat man, now sprawled on the ground.
			-It got up and ran back, further into the grounds, but, from other trees, there came a
			 hail of crossbow bolts, two of which hit Grimble, piercing his magic barrier.
			-Bruce the bat then began to chant strange syllables and, in response, the plants of
			 the observatory grounds began to stir and move. The rat men were forced to fight
			 against entangling foliage, with varying degrees of success.
			-Wasting no further time, D'Roc ran forward, axe over his head, vaulted the wall around
			 the grounds, and, as he landed, cleaved the singed rat-man in two.
			-I wisely took cover behind the wall and manifested a defensive power, but Sarge was
			 quick to follow D'Roc, also leaping the wall, though his wings meant coming down was
			 rather optional. Instead, he annihilated one of the rat-things with a gout of conjured
			 flame from the air.
			-Skye too hurled some kind of spell over the wall, and an ominous emanation began
			 harassing a rat inside the gates.
			-Grimble, bolts sticking out of his little chest, followed _my_ example, ducking for
			 cover behind his own section of wall, and using his healing belt to force out the
			 bolts and mostly close his wounds.
				-Weirdly, Skye looked at this in horror, clutching his necklace and staring, mouth
				 agape.
			-The hail of bolts continued though, without any more hits, but was also joined by
			 some. . . squealing? Sounded like something bigger than the rats. . .
			-Skye muttered more arcane syllables, though, and that squealing intensified, taking on
			 a more frantic tone.
			-Thing had begun to sound quite chaotic inside the grounds, with shouts, the clash of
			 weapons, and various other noises of battle now constant. Safe behind my wall, though,
			 I took my time, carefully aimed at a tree rat who didn't seem to see me, and then gave
			 him some nice goose feathers.
			-Grimble continued to play copycat and crept forward, peeked around the wall, and
			 finshed off my feathered rat with a burst of fire.
			-The bolts flying were joined by some arrows from the observatory's roof and, peeking
			 over the top of the wall, I could see a (sleek, gorgeous, and altogether enviable)
			 weretiger perched up there with a bow.
			-Maya was quick to remedy that and, in a flash of her arcane energies, the tiger, and
			 part of the observatory's crumbling roof, were gone.
			-By that point, the sounds of battle had begun to subside and, with a shout from D'Roc,
			 things went quiet.
		-After a moment or two, I forced the gate open, and boldly strode through.
			-D'Roc was looking around and, seeing none of them moving, he said, "Well, what now?"
			 "We have that bounty. . ." I said, "So, head collecting?"
			-He responded by severing the head of the one at his feet, saying, "Got one."
			 "Well, with that axe, you're probably best suited to handling the rest too," I said.
			-He nodded, and set about his grim work.
			-There was the slight issue of one body that had fallen from the nearby seaside cliff,
			 to the rocks below, but Sarge and Maya's wings proved useful in resolving that.
			-Bruce fluttered around D'Roc as he worked, and eventually called out as D'Roc stood
			 over the body of something that appeared to be a were. . . boar?
			-"This one is still breathing!" he shouted. "Stay your hand young man," he directed to
			 D'Roc.
			-He then flapped down to the ground, and began to chant the words of a spell, closing
			 the creature's wounds.
			-"What are you doing?!?" Skye interjected.
			 "Keeping one alive to interrogate," Bruce replied.
			 "Good thinking!" I said. "Might be more bounties where these came from, with some
			  leads. . ."
			 "Very well. But you should give him release when you're done," Skye insisted.
			 "Eh, I'm amenable to that," I replied.
			-In short order, the beast man began stirring, and we began interrogating.
			-It started with Bruce delivering his intro spiel, "I am the terror that flaps in the
			  night!" and all that.
			-To which I threateningly added, "You're in deep shit, motherfucker."
			-Not too be outdone, Skye muttered the ominous words of some spell, and soon after the
			 were-ganger was terrified and gibbering.
			-That not being much use, Bruce began to attempt to calm the creature down, and
			 eventually asked Skye to back off.
			-Maya then flapped over, and took over, saying, "I'm here from the city. If you
			 cooperate, I can give you a quick death, or have you turned over to the council's
			 justice as you prefer.
			-"Shit. . ." the wereboar began, having regained some composure, "I was part of the
			 gang. . . It wasn't so bad, at first. But then these people with wings started hanging
			 around. Looked a lot like you, actually. They were throwing strange names around. . ."
			 "What kind of names?" Maya asked.
			 "Uh. . . hard to pronounce ones, like _unintelligible gibberish_. . . After they
			  showed up, we were. . . more aggressive. Hit harder targets, took more territory. . ."
			 "What about that building, there?" she continued, gesturing to the ruined observatory.
			 "What's inside of it? Any defenses?"
			 ". . . there's some loot we took. . . and poison gas traps, above the doors."
			 She nodded and continued, saying, "What about other locations? Where else can I find
			  members of your gang?"
			 "I don't know! I mostly hung around here. . . Well, there were rumors. . .  about a. . .
			  wereshark. Something about a diving operation. . ."
			 "Where? Where was this?"
			 ". . . I don't know. . . All I heard was this one takes a. . . special type of subject."
			 "Special how?" Maya asked.
			 ". . . I don't know," he said, but seemed evasive to my ears.
			 "What do you mean, 'special'?" I demanded. "I've heard that word in ominous tones
			  before. . . You know more than you're saying. . ."
			 "I can't help you if you're not honest with me. . ." Maya chimed in.
			 "And I can't help what I'll _do_ to you if you're not. . ." I added.
			 ". . . I know you nobles," the wereboar began. "All pretty until you hear something
			  you don't like, and then you lash out."
			 "She's not like that," Jade responded. "She can help you. . ."
			 "I can. See that fellow with the big axe?" Maya said, gesturing to D'Roc. "He can grant
			  you a quick death. . . Or, I can turn away, and let these scary people do whatever
			  they like with you. And, they _are_ scary. I've spent quite a while with them now. . ."
			 ". . . they need blood that's been by the sea. . . for centuries," he began. "In
			  Sasserine, that means the nobles. They've been. . . recruiting. . . by the shore in
			  the noble district. . ."
			 ". . . I'm not going back in a cage. . ." he continued, "There's just one more thing I
			  want. . ."
			 As he spoke, he began to. . . shift, his face forming even more of a snout and his
			 limbs shortening. ". . . I want to change one last time. . . feel the wild. . ."
			-That earned a nod from D'Roc, who waited a moment, before lopping the head off the
			 now-regular boar that was soon before us.
		-That settled, we immediately put some of the information to use, looting the observatory's
		 ruins.
			-Jade and I debated whether one of us could disable the traps, but neither of us felt
			 especially confident.
			-"Well, he said the _doors_ were trapped," I pointed out. "I watched Maya take out that
			  weretiger, though, and she made a hole in the roof in the process. Between that and
			  her wings, we've got another option. . ."
			-We indeed did just that, with Maya soaring up to the observatory's roof and fastening
			 a rope for us to climb up, and another to climb back down inside.
			-Once inside, we were able to quickly identify, and avoid, the traps. After some
			 searching, we then made our way back up with quite the haul.


9/6/23:
	-Loot and severed heads in hand, we decided we should convert some of that to cold cash.
		-Being. . . a bit too popular with the guards (a fact I took the opportunity to break to
		 Skye), I found a nearby alley to change into my Crimson Crusader outfit.
		-Then, suitably attired, we headed to a nearby guard post.
		-Knocking at the door, we got the attention of a guard just starting the night shift.
		-To him, and gesturing to Maya, I announced, "I, The Crimson Crusader, assisting this scion
		 of your fine city, have vanquished some shapechanging miscreants!"
		-Not missing his cue, Skye then spilled forth seven severed heads.
		-On the guard's face, we saw a quick series of dramatic emotions. Eventually regaining his
		 composure, he stammered out, "Uh. . . let me go fetch my superior."
		-We eventually sorted the matter out, pointing out the marks from their injections and
		 showing Maya's bounty hunting contract. Soon we were walking out with sacks of gold, though
		 also still with the heads.
			-Skye had asked if he could keep the heads and a guard, a bit alarmed at the question,
			 eventually marked the heads with some paint and turned them back over to us.
	-Our next stop, then, was the apothecary who also wanted some lycanthropes dead.
		-She was happy to hear the lycanthropes had been dealt with, and didn't even want to see
		 our grisly proof!
		-We then spent some time oohing and ahing over potions, and all walked off with a varied
		 selection.
	-From there, we sought out a place to unload our loot.
		-Maya fortunately knew of a nearby shop, one popular with gladiators from the nearby arena.
		-She led us there. It's interior was lined with weapons, and contained it's blonde
		 proprietor and her two black cats.
		-Greeting the shopkeep, Maya said that I, The Crimson Crusader, had hard-won loot to sell.
		-Looking over my costumed self, the woman said, "Well, stuff sells better with a story. . ."
		-Maya obliged, spinning an exagerated one about the exploits of the Crimson Crusader when
		 retrieving these arms.
		-It clearly made an impression, and the shopkeep even asked me to sign one of the weapons.
		-I obliged her, calling for a quill and signing the greataxe.
		-"Thanks!" she said. "We'll have it etched in and enchant the axe. Should fetch quite a
		  premium."
		-Maya, riffing on the them, even proposed hosting an event.
		 "Oh, a weapon signing?" the proprietor replied. "I could offer you 25% percent of the
		  profit."
		 "Sounds like a good idea to me!" I said.
		 "Well, I can't do it until after the festival," she said, "But after, lets get something
		  set up.
		 "There may be an opportunity for Jade too here too," Maya added.
		 "Oh yeah!" I chimed in. "She's quite the smith. I've commissioned some works from her
		  myself."
		 "Sure, sure. I'd love to see some samples of her work," the proprietor agreed.
		-We resolved to see her about setting the event up once the festival was over.
	-That settled and the sun setting, we then headed to The Noble's District, to seek out more
	 bounties (_beach_ bounties).
		-We had a fun ferry trip over, the nobles aboard apparently treating it as a pleasure
		 cruise, though the rest of the passengers were being carefully watched by the couple of
		 noble-liveried soldiers aboard.
		-Maya joined her people and ran into a drunk school friend, who she began to regale with
		 tales of The Crimson Crusader.
			-He seemed quite impressed with the exagerated adventures, but also seemed to get the
			 idea that _Sarge_ was The Crimson Crusader.
			-He stumbled over to offer Sarge some wine, at which point I began to speak up, but then
			 suddenly held my tongue. It wouldn't be the _worst_ thing in the world if someone else
			 got the. . . credit. . . for my actions, for a change.
		-We eventually disembarked in The Noble's District and began to discuss our next steps.
			-I asked Maya what she knew about the after dark beach scene in her neighborhood and,
			 between tales of her slightly mispent youth (younger youth?) and what we learned from
			 our were-boar interrogation, we set up a plan to bait an ambush.
			-Some of us, particularly Maya who wouldn't have to do terribly much acting, would
			 pretend to be local nobles, partying on the beach, while the rest of us would conceal
			 ourselves and wait in ambush.
			-That set up, Maya wandered off a bit, faking a drunken stumble and ranting about a
			 boyfriend that had abandoned her.
			-Soon, she was wandering back our way, keeping the act up and with two shadowy figures
			 in tow.
			-They seemed to notice Bruce lurking in a tree but, after a whispered argument, they
			 crept forward again, towards Maya.
			-As they passed beneath his tree, Bruce launched into his introductory spiel, but I
			 only let him get a few words in before I lept up from cover and put an arrow through
			 the eye of one of the figures.
			-Maya spun and attempted to blast the other, but the shot went (fotunately) wide as I
			 began to shout, "Take the other one alive!"
			-He quickly dropped the sap in his hand and, raising his arms above his head, began to
			 (unconvincingly) shout, "Whoa! I just wanted to get you safely home!"
			-Not at all dissuaded, Maya began to shout a mix of threats and questions at him, and
			 he eventually agreed to lead us to where he'd been taking captured nobles, in return
			 for vague promises of letting him go.
				-He also mentioned something about how those he'd been working for, "Seemed like
				 the same person. Different faces, but. . ."
		-Our captive led us to a pier near a cemetary, and then down through a sewer grate, into a
		 cavern.
			-There, in a flooded tunnel that appeared to lead out to the open sea, swam a large
			 shark.
			-D'Roc began to mutter about the fish smelling "unnatural" while our would-be kidnapper
			 began to explain that this was where he was delivering the nobles, though he didn't
			 know what for. "Maybe some kind of sacrifice," he speculated. "You know, to the shark."
			-Skye then turned to the man, and asked, "How much are they paying you to bring them
			  these people?"
			 "A thousand gold a head," he replied.
			 "Shiiit," I said, "They're only paying us a hundred for _your_ head. . ."
			 "Should have negotiated better," he quipped.
			 "That's what I've been saying!" I complained.
			 "How much would it cost for your silence?" Skye then asked, reaching into a pouch and
			 drawing forth a fistful of gold. "To not tell anyone you led us here?"
			 His eyes never leaving the gold, the thug said, ". . . 500 gold."
			-Skye reached forward with his fistful of gold, to meet the man's outstretched hands.
			 As he began to rain coins into the the kidnapper's hands, though, Skye reached out with
			 his other hand, this one bathed in a sickly-looking eldritch light, and grabbed the
			 man's wrist. The thug's face went pale and he screamed as he fell to his knees. Skye
			 was without mercy, though, and held tight to the man's wrist until he stopped moving.
			-That generally met with shrugs from the rest of us, and only a slight justification
			 from Maya who claimed, "I only promised him I wouldn't tell anyone if he helped us. . "
			-Skye calmly reclaimed his coins, save two, though I grabbed those as I stripped the
			 corpse of the rest of its gear too.
		-Looking around the cavern, Skye pointed out another passage, concealed behind some mossy
		 vegetation.
			-We went though the passage, D'Roc with some minor difficulty due to it's narrowness,
			 and found ourselves in another cavern.
			-This one had, at the other end, some stacked bodies and cracked jars (and an altogether
			 unpleasant odor).
			-Skye went off to investigate the bodies, but jumped back as something oozed out of the
			 jars and lunged at the pale elf.
			-As Skye fell back, the ooze emerged fully from the jars and drew up into a mass nearly
			 as tall as D'Roc.
			-Grimble promptly tried to set it on fire, loosing a ball of flame at it, burning off
			 some of its mass.
			-It surged forward, though, engulfing Sarge and Bruce.
			-Maya called out for my help rescuing Sarge so, though I fell back from the ooze, I
			 grabbed Maya's waist. She then reached into the ooze and grabbed Sarge's arm, and it
			 took both of us pulling as hard as we could to drag him free.
			-D'Roc took a different approach, running at the ooze and charging through it, dragging
			 Bruce and some quantity of the jelly out the opposite side of the mass.
			-Jade and I then loosed projectiles at it, with only slight effect.
			-Some more flames from Grimble proved a bit more effective, though not so much as the
			 blast from Maya that followed, finishing it off.
			-It collapsed to a puddle of viscous goo.
		-The. . . jelly (?) slain, we had the luxury of looking around the cavern more and saw,
		 deeper in, a white haired elf slumped over a table, with an enormous bite mark on one arm
		 and some. . . scales (?) around the mark.
			-Maya rushed towards her and, after briefly taking in the scene, she forced some wolf's
			 bane from her belt pouch into the woman's mouth.
			-The pale-haired elf sat up and mumbled something to Maya, but either offended or
			 alarmed Maya as she blasted her fellow elf with her eldritch energies.
			-Doesn't seem like Maya was wrong to have done that as. . . shark people, presumably
			 the were-sharks they'd been making, emerged from the waters pooled around the cavern
			 while the wounded elf stood and began shouting.
			-Well. . . maybe she's an elf? Getting a better look at her, she did look quite strange.
			-I didn't have much time to study the figure, though, as one of the shark monsters lept
			 at me from from a nearby pool, biting my shoulder horribly.
			-I summersaulted back, rolled to my feet, and then shouted, "You motherfucker!" as I
			 crushed his mind with mine, sending him reeling (Ha! Fish joke!) back.
			-Grimble singed the beast with some conjured flames and then fell back to my side, back
			 near the passage by which we entered the cavern.
			-The other end of the cavern was now mostly out of our sight, but we could here the
			 sounds battle as our friends dealt with shark monsters of their own and the maybe-elf.
			-The shark-creature we were dealing with lunged at me again, though, brandishing a
			 trident, leaving me no time to worry about the others.
			-The trident was cold but somehow still burned, as it's tines found gaps in my chainshirt
			 and I fell to the cavern floor. . .
		-The next thing I knew, I woke on the cavern floor, Grimble crouched over me and a charred
		 elf corpse in place of the shark monster that had savaged me.
			-The sounds of battle continued, coming from the other end of the cavern, but they soon
			 died to relative silence as I pulled myself painfully to my feet.
			-I applied the magic of my healing belt to myself and choked down some wolf's bane, then
			 stumbled forward with Grimble to join the rest of our companions.
			-I asked them if they thought there might be more of those nightmares in the water, as
			 D'Roc was busily severing the heads of the noble scions the sharks turned into after
			 death.
			-Fortunately, they assured me that Sarge had delivered some lightning to the water,
			 likely remedying any such matters.
		-Well, our immediate safety somewhat assured, we set about looting.
			-We found some assorted valuable trinkets in nearby crates and a desk.
			-Interestingly, the desk _also_ contained a variety of notes, written in many different
			 languages, and stamped with various seals we also found in the desk.
			-Maya could read all of the languages involved, apparently, and said that these notes
			 and seals could be my redemption in the eyes of The Dawn Council.
				-The not-elf, a creature Jade named a "phasm", was a apparently some kind of
				 shapeshifter and was impersonating various nobles, a thing these notes proved and
				 a very grave matter, one The Dawn Council would be very glad to have resolved.
				-Catching on, I proposed going one step further. "Why settle for redemption," I
				 said, "When you can deflect the blame entirely! _I_ didn't rile up an angry mob at
				  a funeral. . . It was the shapeshifter! I would _never_ do such a thing. . ."
				-Jade looked rather aghast at my baldfaced lies.
				-Maya, though, seemed game, and thought that might work.
				-Thinking on it a bit further, though, Maya and I suspected that magic like Zone of
				 Truth might make that a good deal riskier, so redemption might be the safer option.
			-Ranging a bit further, we also saw an aquarium full of small sharks some distance away,
			 in another branch of the cavern, and a large treasure chest just beyond it.
				-More treasure is always exciting to me, but Maya shockingly let loose a blast of
				 eldritch energy at the chest.
				-Clearly she'd noticed something I didn't, though, as, in response, it began to move
				 of it's own accord, opening it's lid to reveal a set of sharp teeth and a lashing
				 tongue and hopping towards us. Fucking shapeshifters. . .
				-Well, all of us then began sending various projectiles at the chest hopping towards
				 us.
				-It crashed into the aquarium, knocking it over, shattering it, and releasing the
				 sharks that strangely grew larger, but only flopped helplessly on the dry section
				 of cavern floor as they suffocated.
				-The chest-monster soon joined them in their suffering as, bleeding (!) from
				 numerous wounds, it eventually fell still.
			-That matter settled and the notes and seals in her hand, Maya then ran off, back the
			 way we came, shouting over her shoulder, "I need to bring these to my father! He needs
			 to know about this! Finish up here and come find me!"


9/27/23:
	-In my lust for loot, I'd neglected the presence of another tunnel, but, as Maya began to run
	 off, Bruce called out to her, yelling, "Hey! Wait! There's still another tunnel over here. . ."
	-Sure enough, tucked in one corner of the cavern, there was an opening, leading to lichen
	 covered stairs the descended further.
	-D'Roc, with Bruce on his shoulder, crept over to it, and Bruce reported some sort of flapping
	 noise coming from below.
	-We all then proceeded down the stair, cautiously in light of the movement ahead, a gradually
	 all smelt a foul chemical stink.
		-Skye pronounced it a preservative of some kind, one commonly used with corpses. . .
	-Well, that was enough to make us all rather cautious.
		-I myself manifested Defensive Precognition, and encouraged Grimble to "not get any of that
		 on his boots" by shrinking and being strapped into his harness on my chest.
	-We then proceeded on a bit further down the stair before Maya raised a hand and called another
	 halt.
		-She muttered something about an arcane script on the wall, mentioning a laboratory and
		 some demonic agreement.
		-Well, caution certainly _was_ wise. . .
	-We didn't let that stop us, though, and, continuing down, could soon here some distant clamor
	 and the clanking of chains.
	-Rounding a corner, we bore witness to a series of small, fluttering demons, which Bruce
	 pronounced "quasits" trying to restrain some kind of giant, be-tentacled mutant ape, chained
	 to a wall across the room the stairwell opened onto.
		-Within moment of our coming onto the scene, the ape ripped it's last remaining restraints
		 free from their moorings on the wall behind the beast and swatted one of quasits from the
		 air, with it disappearing into a chasm across the room.
		-Meanwhile, one of the other quasits flapped off down another hallway at great speed.
		-That left three of the little demons and the immense ape-beast, so, the choice being clear,
		 I crept forward and loosed an arrow at the ape.
			-It was an excellent shot, but one of the ape-thing's tentacles swatted at the arrow,
			 deflecting it into a glancing blow.
		-Grimble, strapped to my chest, then whispered complaints to me, saying, "You should have
		  gotten closer! I'm not in range!"
		 "Fuck," I responded. "Do you see that thing?!? I'm not getting anywhere near it! Just set
		  it on fire if it gets anywhere close to us. I don't want to wake up on the floor again,
		  or worse. . ."
		-Sarge was more foolhardy, though, and darted out into the room and conjured a hail of
		 stones, battering the ape and quasits both.
		-The quasits had the right idea after that, and one by one they disappeared from sight in
		 some arcane shimmer, either gone or invisible.
		-The combo of D'Roc and Bruce still perched on his shoulder were not not disuaded, though,
		 and strode into the room.
		-Bruce muttered some magic syllables, conjuring a dust of twinkling light where one of the
		 quasits had been, and indeed still was, as it found itself outlined by the light.
		-D'Roc wasted no time cleaving the demon in twain.
		-The ape-thing was following the same logic as me, it seemed, as it than rushed towards the
		 similarly large D'Roc, who thankfully was strong enought to shove back the charging beast.
		-He could not, though, evade its long, grasping tentacles, which snaked around D'Roc's limbs.
		-The creature thankfully held D'Roc at some distance, so the rest of us began to pelt it
		 with various projectiles, magical and mundane both.
			-Grimble used a now quite tiny crossbow, looking up at me apologetically as the tiny
			 dart bounced off the thing's hide, and said, "I used the last of the fire conjuring
			 above. . ."
		-The ape was now bleeding heavily from a variety of wounds, but our luck didn't hold.
		 Another of the the damned shark monsters came charging out from the hallway a quasit had
		 flown off down, smashing into D'Roc and biting away at him.
		-The now-bleeding and still-grappled D'Roc responded with a great axe blow, wounding the
		 creature right back, while the rest of my companions continued a hail of projectiles, now
		 at both beasts.
		-Seeing another of these shark-beasts, I myself shouted, "Not another of these fucking fish!"
		-Staring it down, I then attempted to crush it's mind, but, in it's rage, it didn't seem to
		 even notice, only increasing _my_ rage.
		-Sarge met with more success with the ape, though, bellowing deafeningly and loosing from
		 his draconic jaws some air distorting energy, blasting the beast to pieces.
		-The shark-thing remained though, and, after another eldritch blast from Maya, D'Roc gored
		 the beast with his horns and then shook it's lifeless, and slowly re-humanoid-ifying, form
		 free. It slid off the side of the stonework we were perched on, into the chasm below us.
			-Following it with my eyes, I could see what appeared to be a city below: various large
			 buildings illuminated by some kind of luminous fungus on the chasm walls below.
		-"Are those quasits still about?" I asked. "Can anyone. . . detect them?"
		 "They're gone," Bruce pronounced.
		 "Well, we should probably go find them, then. Before they find us. . ."
	-Looking about, there were a pair of bridges, leading off in various directions from where
	 we were.
		-We elected to follow the one to the East, where we saw at least _one_ quasit go, and from
		 which the shark moster came.
		-It led to a series of chambers, showing some signs of life.
		-One held a lit campfire, and another a cracked door, from which emerged a bit of light and
		 the sound of something banging against rock.
		-We crept towards the door and, when D'Roc shoved it open, he was rewarded with a rock
		 hurled at him from a purple tentacle within.
		-We were all bunched up in a narrow hallway, so, though Skye began to cast some spell, the
		 rest of us waited until D'Roc charged into the room, swinging his axe at the tentacles.
		-As the minotaur and tentacle monster did battle, the rest of us crept forward, loosing the
		 occasional projectile at the tentacles, which seemed to just emerge from the ground.
			-I managed to hit one with an arrow, but it just glanced of the thick hide (?).
		-D'Roc and Maya were a good deal more effective, though.
		-However, when one of the tentacles managed to grab D'Roc, he staggered, a sickly expression
		 on his face, as dark energy emanated from the grasping tentacle.
			-Well, I don't want to get anywhere near _that_.
		-Skye responded with one of his freaky, disembodied hands he conjures, and the tentacle
		 seemed to find that about as unpleasant.
		-D'Roc then took the opportunity to sever the tentacle grabbing his leg with his axe, along
		 with several more of them. The whole wriggling mass shriveled and then went limp.
		-We moved forward into the room, and D'Roc mentioned he saw the quasit, but that it flew
		 off through the passage to the North.
		-Near where the tentacles lay limp, there some small eggs, and we could resist poking at
		 them.
		-Skye was first to grab one, and he dumped some dark energy into it.
		-As if in response, it cracked, and a tiny black bird emerged.
		-Maya, though, promptly blasted it, saying it "looked wrong".
		-D'Roc then shrugged, and stomped all the rest of the eggs.
		-The resulting bloody mess. . . stirred, though, slowly combining into one mass.
		-This fascinated Skye and Maya, though, who began to discuss how it was. . . changing.
			-Skye scraped up the bird corpse, into a pouch he pulled from his bag.
			-Maya, meanwhile, uncorked a healing potion and poured it on the quivering mass, which
			 caused it to change color and then go still.
			-After staring a while longer, Maya pointed at faint writing around where the egg
			 remnants lay, saying it was Abyssal, and exhorted the contents of the circle the
			 writing formed to take on a kind of parody of perfection.
			-The arcanists among us fell to discussing the matter, mentioning "Demogorgon", a
			 demon prince, but my attention wandered, and I looked around the room for something of
			 more tangible value, but found only rocks.
				-I did catch them discussing a resemblance between Demogorgon and the tentacled ape
				 monster from the room nearby.


10/4/23:
	-"Well, all this playing with bird eggs is great and all," I quipped, "But maybe we should make
	  sure the rest of this place isn't full of more lurking horrors waiting to eat us?"
		-The others generally agreed with that thesis, though they wanted to take care of some
		 healing and other quick prep before we continued.
	-That settled, we headed back towards the cavern that held a campfire, pausing outside its
	 entrance to listen for signs of life.
		-Bruce warned us that it was "Quiet. . . Too quiet. I should be able to hear something from
		 those flames, at least. . ."
		-Walking inside, we could hear _our_ footfalls, at least.
		-Inspecting the fire closer, it was emanating from some kind of crystal, and didn't feel
		 hot. Clearly magic. . .
		-Jade then inspected it, and. . . then nothing. She stood there motionless, and didn't
		 respond to us calling her name, or even Bruce and Maya shaking her.
		-Ten minutes or so later, she stirred on her own. Her first words were, ". . . Did we just
		 go back to town? How did we get back here?"
		 "You've been staring at the fire, motionless, for ten minutes or so," I replied.
		 "Huh. . ."
		-She then rummaged through her bags, inspecting some of her things, and then got excited,
		 exclaiming, "Guys, this is the most important magic item we've yet found. Some of my work,
		 crafting work, it _is_ a day further along. . . I. . ."
		-She went to move, and then staggered, looking pale. "It. . . may have some downsides. . ."
			-It's the Crystal of Lost Time (10 minutes = 1 day of work for 1d4 Con damage).
				-Ah, I think Jade and Maya later gave it away to Zyrastra (grumble): https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1179609124766498876
		 "It does, though," she went on, "Mean I can make you those cloaks _a lot_ quicker."
		 "OK, that's what I want to hear!" I said. "The benefit to me! Grab it!"
		-That matter settled, we looked around the rest of the room.
			-There was another door to the South, which we started towards.
			-I also pointed out, though, that there were rather a lot of bones about here too.
			 "Ominous," I pointed out. "Unless I guess they got a little too lost in that crystal?"
			-The others began poking around the bones debating what they came from and identifying
			 a variety of humanoids.
				-When Jade mentioned one was an illithid, that caught my attention. Sounds like Ed
				 business, and maybe a way to get him off my back if I'm ever called to report. . .
		-Turning back to that door, D'Roc approached it, then stumbled back. "The door is. . .
		  breathing?"
			-Sure enough it was indeed slowly expanding outward and then contracting, rythmically.
			-There was a lot more debate about what the hell this was, but not a lot of conclusion.
			-Eventually, D'Roc boldly tried knocking on the door, with a less than ideal outcome:
			 he, and a couple of the others nearby, were hurled backwards by some strange force.
			-The walls of the chamber then also began to move, in a similar fashion to the door.
			-I too began to move, slowly backing towards the entrance, my gnome buddy quickly
			 following me in that.
			-Sarge, though, called for our attention, over by the pedestal the crystal had sat on,
			 saying, "Guys! Come look at this! Theres's something visible down here, a city. . ."
			-I continued heading towards the exit, while Sarge began to shout down into the hollow
			 in the top of the pedestal.
			-I stopped short, though, as I spotted a short figure, something like a gray-skinned
			 gnome, trepidatiously climbing out of the large hole to the North and approaching us.
			-The creature began to haltingly speak, in Undercommon, saying, "I. . . am the. . .
			 sacrifice, oh gods. . ."
			 "What now?" I replied, in Undercommon. "Well, yeah, sure, I'm a god. What's the deal
			  here?"
			-That led to a. . . weird conversation.
				-It seemed this creature's people, coming from the city below, had been making
				 sacrifices to the "gods" above, who sounded like the demons and shapechangers we'd
				 just fought, in the form of adult citizens, to provide labor and. . . food.
					-He also spilled onto the floor some uncut gemstones he brought as tribute from
					 his people.
				-He was deeply disturbed when I asked if he spoke Common, but also seemed to speak
				 Draconic, which worked for more of our party.
				-That prompted him to ask if the dragons were returning, and thread Sarge eagerly
				 seized upon and, saying that was indeed so.
				-Maya too was happy to continue that line of conversation, pushing something of a
				 conversion to the worship of Bahamut.
					-She handed the critter a holy symbol of the dragon god, and some candy.
						-"God's first commandment," I broke in, "Take candy from strangers."
					-He devoured the candy, eyes widening with delight, as he muttered something
					 about "the fungus of the gods".
					-Sarge took a moment to touch the holy symbol too, while muttering arcane
					 syllables, and it burst into illusory flames.
					-Maya then asked him to return with this to his people, and began prattling
					 through some of the precepts of Bahamut.
					-Skye also handed him a potion to go with it, mentioning to us it was one of
					 Eagle's Splendor, saying, in Draconic, that he should drink it before
					 conversing with his people.
						-"God's second commandment," I added, "Chug! Chug! Chug!"
						-I wonder what impact the laughter of the "gods" is having on this guy.
				-We actually began to load this poor little guy up with "scripture".
					-Skye recommended that they embrace and not fear death, in the name of Nkisi.
					-D'Roc asked if he could get some Dog in the mix there, but I (correctly)
					 pointed out that "Chug! Chug! Chug!" basically covered that.
					-I myself wedged in, "Also, anyone as handsome and charming as I is clearly
					 sacred."
					-Maya helped the gnome remember it all by inscribing various bits of what we
					 were telling him on handy bits of paper from her pack.
						-He said he couldn't read himself, but that his elders could.
			-Eventually, thoroughly confused, the poor guy stumbled back off to the hole he crawled
			 out of.
				-Importantly, leaving those uncut gems behind.
			-"Well, we screwed that guy up pretty bad," I commented. "He's going to go back to his
			  people, talking all crazy. They're going to _kill_ him."
			 "Or build a statue of him," Sarge replied.
			 "Either way, those little guys seem like they could use some help. Maya, this shit is
			  basically under your house, right?"
			 "Well," she replied, "I think we descended pretty deep. . . and there were some
			  demonic runes along the way. I'm not sure we can make reliable judgments about where
			  we are. . ."
			 "Eh, in any event, this is pretty _accessible_ from your house. We might want to ask
			  your father to send some guards to look in on these little guys. They clearly need the
			  help, and, judging from the gems, there might be some profit in it. We shouldn't let
			  more Shapers find their way to. . . wherever we are, either."
			 ". . . I'm not sure that's safe," she said. "At least, we should make sure we've
			  explored the rest of this place. I think there was another stair was passed. . ."
			 "Sure, definitely. We should clear it, but probably also keep an eye on it once we
			  get out of here. . ."
				-With that last, I was eying the still moving walls. . .
	-We then indeed went over to that stair, following it upwards, but it ended in a bundle of. . .
	 nerves?
		-I was getting very creeped out by whatever this place was.
		-"So. . . what say you we get the hells out of here?" I said. "I'm happy to lead the way,
		  this time."
		-I then started heading back to the stairwell that led us here in the first place, Grimble
		 in tow.
		-The others soon followed, but several of them were muttering about the fate of those weird
		 gnomes.
	-By the time I reached the entrance, I looked back and saw Nkisi was gone.
		-Bruce mentioned he could hear him shouting, back in the direction of the hole that gnome
		 climbed out of.
		-Bruce flew off in that direction, soon followed by Maya and D'Roc.
		-I, though, focused on getting the hells out of there, especially since _all_ the walls
		 were now shuddering, and quite a bit more violently.
	-Ascending the stair, I reached the caves above, the watery ones where we first encountered the
	 were-sharks.
		-There, the walls were thankfully unmoving, so I took a breather and waited for the others.
		-A few minutes later, they joined me. . . along with something like two dozen of these gray-
		 skinned gnomes, carrying assorted belongings.
			-The gnomes were led, no less, by our friend from earlier, still carrying his glowing
			 holy symbol and his crumpled bits of scripture.
			-My allies began talking over one another, but I heard stuff about the caverns below
			 moving even more, maybe collapsing, an escape over a chasm, and that these gnomes were
			 the survivors.
		-Well, taking their rough day in stride, I led my friends, new and old, up to the surface.
	-On the surface, these gnomes (who I heard the others refer to as "deep gnomes") stared in awe
	 and terror at the star-studded sky.
		-"Don't be afraid!" Skye said. "These lights are part of your rebirth."
		 "Rebirth, yeah," I chimed in. "That means it's time for a baptism. . . Let's find a tavern!"
		-We, and two dozen confused gnomes carrying random belongings, all streamed into a nearby
		 tavern named The Cat and the Cucumber.
		-"Barkeep!" I shouted, "Do you sell drink by the cask? I've got a couple dozen thirsty
		  gnomes. . ."
		-We arranged a package deal on a bulk quantity of gnomish whiskey and got the party, *cough*,
		 I mean, _sacred celebration_, started!
			-The gnomes, perhaps motivated by some recent trauma, took to the second commandment
			 with gusto, and it was a great time.
			-The first of the deep gnomes we met finally introduced himself as Glimmerdrift, and
			 his people as Clan Stonecloak.
			-He and Maya disappeared out the tavern door right around the start of the party, with
			 returning alone a short while later.
			-Skye wasn't shy about the drink, or about introducing new rituals.
				-He had one of the gnomes bring over a cookpot she'd brought with from their village
				 and asked any gnome he could catch to write down the names and deeds of those lost
				 in the escape and place it into the cookpot. "Your ancestors," he intoned, "Are here
				 within, to be revered and mourned."
				 "Yeah! Tell their stories!" I chimed in.
				-Soon, though, he heard something or another that set him off, and he began
				 repeating something in Elvish. The gnomes were quick to take up the chant, though
				 Grimble informed me that what they were all saying was Elvish for "blasphemy".
			-I also shared some more "scripture" of my own, telling them the story of Party. . . no,
			 _Saint_ Party Lizard, promising them we'd all go on a pilgrimage to see him one day.
			-Soon, I was quite drunk, and Grimble was vomiting into a boot.
			-Maya then returned, saying she'd been to see her father, had told him of what we'd
			 learned below, and put in a good word for me.
			-She said we should enjoy the party, but that we should be on watch tonight, and to
			 expect blood in the streets tomorrow morning.
			-Grimble continued vomiting.


10/18/23:
	-I soon found myself leashed to a chair for some reason. The barkeep was still bringing whiskey
	 by though, so, eh. . .
		-Suspiciously, Maya had come over to "check" on me just before. . .
	-Skye headed for the door, and came back a few moments, surrounded by assorted skeletons and
	 zombies.
		-That caused some alarm, with the drunk gnomes drawing up into some semblance of battle
		 order.
		-Skye calmed them, claiming his. . . new friends were ancestors, returned serve, to
		 protect us.
			-"Serve?" I said. "Shit, have them bring some more whiskey over here then. I'm tied
			  to a chair for some reason. . ."
		-That seemed to mollify them, but not so the bartender, who demanded that Skye, "Get those
		  things out of here!"
		 "Would it help if I bought them drinks?" Skye asked.
		 ". . . Can they drink them?" the bartender responded.
		 "I can!" I broke in. "You there, skeleton! Bring me more whiskey!"
		 "What does it matter?" Skye said. "It's still gold in your hand. . ."
		-The bartender, seemingly resigned to our shit, shrugged and started pouring.
	-I woke up in a bed, in a rented room above the bar, which was a decided improvement on the
	 chair I fell asleep tied to.
		-Walking downstairs, I collected my boots, stared into one of them, and then asked the bar
		 full of bleery gnomes and other assorted allies, "Why is one of my boots full of spew?
		  Grimble! Where are you? I need some magic cleaning. . ."
		-Grimble crawled out from beneath a table and, after some studying of his spellbook, sorted
		 my boot.
	-Walking over to where several of the others were talking, Maya claimed to have heard from her
	 god, who wanted us to go back down to that demon-dungeon again.
		-I had some reservations about the subject, but Sarge seemed to be on board, wondering if
		 his increasing power might be the result of growing closer to his dragon side, and hoping
		 this "test" might continue that.
		-Maya also believed there might be some connection between. . . whatever that was, down
		 beneath the district, and that pearl people are always after. She'd had some vision earlier
		 of it calling some tentacled demon. . .
		-"Well, the first trip down _was_ profitable," I volunteered, "But also rather dangerous. . .
		  How do we get gone in a hurry, with any loot, when the walls start shaking again?"
		-In response, one of Skye's. . . new friends spoke up, saying, "Pook can help!"
			-Pook, at least, seemed to be a living man, albeit filthy and carved with scars forming
			 arcane ruins. He was carrying a ragged little doll.
			-He proceeded to grab a nearby chair, distended his jaw like a snake, and swallowed the
			 chair.
			 "Uh. . ." I began, but the bartender interrupted.
			 "Hey!" he shouted, "You can't go eating the chairs!"
			-Pook promptly vomited forth the chair, along with several odds and ends, including a
			 shovel.
				-The. . . concerned bartender stared a moment at the slobbery chair, then wandered
				 off muttering.
			-"Well," I said, "I guess that's volunteering to _carry_ the loot? Still doesn't solve
			  how we escape in a hurry, though, if the walls start moving again. . ."
		-We then fell to debating what to do with a demon big enough to _build_ inside of.
			-We didn't really come to a firm conclusion, though, other than shopping!
	-So, _something_ at least settled on, we went off in search of various shops, and a guard post
	 to redeem some bounties.
		-Maya and the Crimson Crusader had not problem redeeming the bounties, and we even talked
		 them into something extra for the shapeshifter who was impersonating various nobles.
		-Then, most of us ran off to the merchant district, though Maya wanted to go see some other
		 guard, to thank him for some past favor.
			-D'Roc went with her, to watch her back.
		-We found an emporium of all things magical, and several of the others got various enchanted
		 items. Grimble, though, was only able to confirm they could teach him the spells he wanted
		 to learn, since he told me he'd need at least a day per spell to do the work.
		-We spent enough time pouring over the shop's magics that Maya and D'Roc eventually found us
		 there.
		-Maya was in a hurry to have a chat, so I hurried the others along.
		-We then swung by a pawnbroker, to unload our loot, and then headed to a bakery for lunch.
	-At the bakery, over cupcakes, Maya laid out what she learned from her visits to a favorite
	 guard and then her father.
		-Her father had informed her that the nobles are at each other's throats due to the
		 shapeshifter revelations, and that the Dawn Council is slowly dissolving as a result.
		-Maya also thinks she knows where that pearl is, her father being old enough to have been
		 around when last it was above the waves.
			-She described flooded low-lying districts of the city, in the inlet between the
			 Champion and Noble districts, where last the pearl was seen, but which might also be
			 home to some aquatic elves who relations have long since deteriorated with.
			-We then discussed options for accessing such an area.
				-Jade can help some number of us breath underwater, and water breathing potions
				 should run aroung 750 gp. and last 10 hours each.
				-Jade also volunteered that she might be able to manage a Locate Object spell.


11/5/23:
	-The festival in Sasserine is tomorrow.
		-It'll be a full moon, with some implications for the Shapers.
		-Maya also inisted there's some connection between the date and the huge demon that's
		 beneath (?) Sasserine. She believes it might stir, or even wake, and come in search of the
		 pearl.
	-Well, what do we do about that pearl?
		-Jade was not confident her magics could find it by _tomorrow_.
		-Maya _did_ have some notes seized from that shapechanger, but they are in a cipher.
		-The others didn't know how to read it, and didn't believe me when I claimed it said, "Get
		 on your airship and get the hell out of here before a giant demon wakes up!"
		-Maya opted to call in a favor, requesting help from a scholar she knew in the Noble District.
		-Calling on him, he was indeed able to make some sense of the cipher, translating them to
		 some kind coordinates. Coordinates, though, without a map. . .
		-Since they describe something relative to Sasserine landmarks, though, he suggested that
		 one of the shipping companies, or perhaps the dredgers, might be able to help us.
		-We _had_ previously been in the estate of the noble house that ran the dredging.
			-Maya, her eyes lighting up, asked if anyone had any candy.
			-At our quizical looks, she elaborated: when last we were there, she'd bribed that kid
			 with candy to not mention our presence, and he might be amenable to similar deals.
			-Seemed reasonable(-ish) to me, so I agreed we should go find a candy shop, but also
			 suggested we have a firey back up plan, asking that we stop again at that magic shop
			 for Grimble to copy a scroll with the help of that time crystal.
	-So, some shopping!
		-First, we went back to that magic shop.
			-I asked if my good friend Grimble could copy a spell. "He's looking to put on a show
			 for the festival tomorrow. Something flashy. . . A fireball, should do."
			-The shopkeep seemed a bit skeptical, suggesting a nice illusion instead, but, "Where's
			 the fun in safe?" Fred asked.
			-The shopkeeper eventually agreed, and so, for the usual fee, less our negotiated
			 discount he found a spellbook for Grimble to copy from.
			-He warned us that Grimble had barely enough time to get that done by tomorrow, but I
			 assured him that magic can solve _many_ problems, as Grimble pulled out that Crystal
			 of Lost Time.
			-He concentrated on the crystal, and then things got weird. The gnome strobed in and out
			 of existence for a bit, coming to after ten minutes, wild-eyed and jabbering.
				-"I saw some things! Crazy things!"
				 ". . . But you got the spell copied, right?" Fred asked.
				 "Sure! But. . ."
				 "Good, good."
			-Maya also picked up a Wand of Message.
			-While there, I also asked about maps, hoping the shop's learned proprietors could point
			 us at those who might have a collection of antique charts.
				-One of the wizards there suggested the mercantile guilds might have what we need.
	-Rather than stop for candy, then, we opted to head to the docks, and meet with representatives
	 of the merchant's guild that operates the docks.
		-Striding into their offices, Maya was quick to introduce herself, which also quickly
		 reminded us of what are previous dealings with these folks were. . .
		-Before anything else, the guildmember wanted to talk to Maya about the berth her father had
		 rented, saying that no wizard they'd hired has been able to remove that antimagic field.
		-He was something of a jerk about it, and had no interest in Maya and my attempts to spin it
		 as a tourist attraction for visiting scholars. Ultimately, though, he just wanted Lord
		 Dracus to keep paying the rent, a problem I'll leave to Maya.
		-That settled, he was willing to talk to Maya about maps, for what I insisted was "her
		 school project".
		-Some digging around in their dusty backrooms eventually turned up what we needed. An old
		 map featured some long submerged locks that once existed at the mouth of Sasserine's bay,
		 at the location our deciphered coordinates described.
	-Our location known, we fell to discussing how exactly we could get to this submerged ruin we
	 hoped held the pearl.
		-There were a lot of different strategies bandied about, and different magics that might
		 help.
		-We settled on scrolls of Swim and potions of Waterbreathing, and then making our way to
		 the older sections of the sewers, which we believed connected to flooded tunnels leading
		 to the old, submerged locks.
			-Jade also convinced us to fund the purchase of an Eternal Wand of Swift Haste, which
			 she says she can use to hasten two of all day long, every day.
	-Poor Forcas met his end near an entrance to the old sewers, so we returned to the scene of
	 that crime (I don't think _we_ committed any crimes there. . .).
		-After our last visit, someone had apparently welded bars over the sewer entrance, so D'Roc
		 set about trying to rip them off.
		-At first, the struggled, and the wrenching noises of partial success caught the attention
		 of a man passing by, but I spun a story about a lost wedding ring and a scary wife, and
		 soon that man was asking nearby shopkeepers for us if they could lend a pry bar.
		-Moments later, we were in a filthy sewer.
		-Soon, we were navigating some rickity scaffolding covered in rats, across a chasm.
		-As we went, the sewers steadily grew older, with differing styles of stonework increasingly
		 worn (and slimey).
		-Eventually, we reached a flooded tunnel, and got to the real fun.
	-We drank our potions and cast our scrolls, and then dove right in.
		-We hustled along, hoping to be back above water before any of the relevant magics wore off.
		-Some distance down the tunnel, though, we found our way blocked by some ghostly figures.
		-They didn't seem immediately hostile, and spoke to us in a language I didn't recognize.
		-Grimble and Bruce, though, seemed to at least partly follow them, with Grimble doing some
		 halting translation.
			-They were speaking a strange Sylvan dialect, and asking after our intent, our
			 "connection to the land".
			-Hearing that from Grimble, I turned to Bruce, saying, "Well, that rather sounds like a
			 you problem?"
			-He indeed attempted to converse with them, but so too did Maya, speaking in, I think,
			 Elvish.
			-That last really caught their attention, and they swarmed around her as she continued,
			 eventually. . . singing a song for them?
			-That did the trick, though, and they let us pass.
		-Continuing on a while further, we could eventually see a light at the end of the tunnel.
		-Approaching, that proved to be coming from where the tunnel opened out into the bay.
		-Below the opening, there were jumbled bits of worked stone and, out in the open water, there
		 were humanoids (perhaps finned elves?) apparently patroling the water.
		-Maya lead the way out into the bay, but then stopped, and clutched her head.
			-Suddenly, we were elsewhere, along with some of those patrolling figures.
			-No longer underwater, the strangers appeared stricken, gasping for air and lying on
			 the ground.
				-Maya rushed to check on them, pouring water over the gills of one of them, but they
				 _did_ seem to be able to breath, albeit not well. One of the others croaked out a
				 few Elvish words to her.
			-Around us was a raging battle, humanoids in a wide variety of armor styles engaged in
			 a great melee. Maya, looking up at it, utterd, ". . . Ysgard?"
			 "Ysgard?!?" Jade said. "Why Ysgard?"
			 "Yeah, how the hell did we get here?" I asked. "Maya clutched her head, then. . . What
			  happened, Maya?"
			 "I. . . I don't know. . . I don't feel well. . ."
			-One of the fighters, a giant, then called out to D'Roc, yelling, "Bullman! Help me! I
			  served your parents!"
			 "Uh. . ." he wavered.
			-Meanwhile Jade cast her eyes about, taking in the scene around us.
			-Bruce, though, was first to act, casting some spell on D'Roc, and was soon joined by
			 Maya doing the same.
			-Grimble, meanwhile, cast some spell on _himself_, so I followed that by manifesting my
			 precognition and unlimbering my bow.
			-After a moment, D'Roc clearly made his decision, charging into the melee, axe held high.
			-Cleaving through several of the giants golem-like opponents earned a complement from the
			 giant, and a moment of respite for them both.
			 "Well done, little one!" the giant said to D'Roc. "You seem. . . strange, though. . .
			  almost like you're alive?"
			-They fell to discussing how the giant knew D'Roc's parents, a thing I didn't entirely
			 follow, filled with references to a maze and places I'd never heard of.
			-Eventually, though, the giant indeed confirmed we were in Ysgard, and D'Roc asked him
			 how we get get home, since it was "not our time yet."
			-"You'll have to cross the bridge," the giant thundered. "Come, little ones. I will take
			  you."
			-He led us through the frey to a great castle, with a vivid rainbow leading from it into
			 the sky.
				-It was only there that I noticed Pook was not with us, and that I'd not seen him
				 since the water.


11/15/23:
	-On the walk to that castle, suddenly, _literally_ out of thin air, a backpack dangling from a
	 rope appeared, the rope leading up to. . . nothing? It just disappeared a few feet up.
		-". . . I think that may be our way out?" Maya speculated.
		 "Well, uh, ladies first," I replied, gesturing too it.
		-When she climbed the rope and disappeared without any screaming or the like, one by one,
		 the rest of us followed.
	-Climbing it myself, I suddenly found myself back on the material plane, near where we'd left
	 it, with Sarge and Skye there waiting for us.
		-"So, was this your doing?" I asked them.
		 "The rope, yeah, but not the orb," Sarge replied.
		 "The orb?" I asked. "You found it?"
		 "No, _that_ orb," Sarge clarified, pointing at a green-ish orb of arcane energies, writhing
		 in the open water a short distance away where, I think, we'd been swimming when we suddenly
		 found ourselves in Ysgard.
		-In fact, as we watched, the orb slowly faded away, revealing several of the finned elves,
		 apparently the ones I'd last seen flopping about on dried land, now stirring listlessly in
		 the water, seemingly in a bad way.
		-"They need our help!" Jade called out, swimming forward while drawing a wand from her pack.
		-A noble intention, but I also had some worries about what happened to us, and if it would
		 happen again. . .
			-Fortunately, Maya seemed to have some idea, mumbling things about some "demonic
			 influence" in her head and "wards forcing it away".
			-That did give Jade pause, and she stopped well short of the stricken elves. ". . . So
			 it might recur? I might be able to help with that. . ." she said.
			-Returning to us, she quickly rummaged in her bag, drew forth some parchment, and began
			 scratching at it as best she could underwater. "Here," she said, handing it to Maya.
			 "This scroll might help."
			-Maya nodded, and, taking it began to intone arcane syllables she read from it.
			-Jade, meanwhile, swam forward, touching each of the strange elves with her wand in turn,
			 after which each righted itself and began to look at us warily.
		-Now healed, they swam over to one another and began to. . . sign to each other?
			-Maya, Bruce, and Jade then set about trying different languages they knew, attempting
			 to communicate with the creatures.
			-Eventually, Maya seemed to have the greatest success, copying some of their signs and
			 receiving some back.
			-"They said. . . something about a cave below, and an elder?" she translated.
			 "Well, take us to their leader, I guess!" I replied.
	-Swimming down to the floor of the bay, there was indeed a tunnel mouth, into which we swam.
		-A short distance inside, the water began to. . . change, swirling and moving of it's own
		 accord, eventually forming a huge humanoid form: a water elemental.
		-Bruce proceeded to converse with the creature in Aquan, translating for us as Maya and Jade
		 asked him to relay our interest in the pearl.
		-The elemental, from Bruce's translation, was wary, warning of the corrupting power of the
		 pearl, eventually demanding some kind of "test" of us.
		-Bruce initially translated it as a test of strength, which had D'Roc stepping up, but he
		 clarified that it didn't mean exactly _physical_.
		-Well, it seemed like the elemental seemed ready to _get_ physical, as it drew up to it's
		 full size and lunged towards us.
		-As a battle began, Bruce called out, "Water. . . it values tenacity! Not exactly force. . ."
		-If he was going to clarify any further, I didn't hear it, as the elemental reached forward,
		 forming a vortex that swept up much of the party, though I was able to quickly swim aside.
		-That was followed by a wave of dark energy emanating from the vortex. . . which fucking
		 hurt.
			-Where did _that_ come from?
		-Skye's skeletons seemed to enjoy it, if anything, and swarmed forward at the elemental,
		 blocking it's vortex.
		-But revealing Grimble's limp form. . .
		-I swam over to him and healed him with several charges from my magic belt. Then, grabbing
		 him, I dragged him upward in the water, getting some distance between us and this disaster.
		-A few moments later, though, the rest of the party seemed to have sorted the matter. Sarge
		 waved his hands, there was a flash of light, and the elemental was surrendering, handing
		 over a tiny, black pearl from which shadows seemed to emanate.
	-After some debate over who should dare touch that thing, we settled on following Bruce's advice
	 that Jade is probably responsible enough for it.
		-She grabbed it and, examining it, muttered that, ". . . It causes tsunamis. _Global_
		 tsunamis. . . "
		-Well, neat!
		-Maya suggested that Jade might be able to reuse it's energies, as she had with lesser magic
		 items, but Jade warned that would require _lots_ of research, lest it release the pearl's
		 tsunamis.
	-We also did a lot yelling at Skye.
		-Apparently that dark energy that nearly killed Grimble was _him_.
		-He again tried to sell us on how wonderful death is, but we decided he could put that into
		 practice by walking in front of D'Roc from now on.
	-We then proceeded to retrace our steps, heading back up to the city.
		-As we went back, Maya asked for my help "uniting the city's nobles."
		 "Uh, my track record on that score hasn't been great thus far. . ."
		-Despite my protests, she was quite insistent that it was time for the triumphant public
		 return of Fred the Red to the city of Sasserine and, well, being icognito _had_ become
		 rather tedious. . .
	-We made our way back to the Dracus estate, where Maya greeted a guard with a code word of some
	 kind.
		-The outside of the estate bore signs of conflict, scorch marks and blood, that were new
		 since even last we were here. Clearly the city is still a mess (without me!).
		-We were led inside to a kind of chapel, built around the statue of a dragon, which a
		 cheery Maya was happy to inform us was said to be one of her ancestors.
			-We rather befouled the place, dripping sewer water all over.
		-Eventually, were were joined by Maya's father.
		-Maya greeted him with a weird anecdote about her childhood, something about pink buckets
		 in the sand of a beach.
		-He corrected her, saying the buckets had been green, earning a hug from her. A doppleganger
		 test, I guess. . .
		-She then informed him that we'd retrieved the pearl, and they began to discuss calling for
		 some kind of emergency convocation of the nobility.
		-She initially pushed for this as a route to peace, but he had his doubts, warning that
		 their fellows are likely to take the alarm as an excuse for _more_ violence.
		-So, she proposed a slightly different plan, going to _the people_, pushing for _more_
		 violence, to eliminate the nobility save for their house.
			-Why Maya, I didn't think you had it in you. . .
		-Though impressed by her ambition, he asked if she really thought such a thing could be
		 accomplished, but I happily chimed in that I was able to set the city aflame with a single
		 funeral speech already, and this time the coals still smoldered. . .
		-After a moment's thought, he nodded, fetched some papers from a secret compartment in the
		 chapel, and they began to discuss the specifics.
		-They also discussed if the shadow pearl could be destroyed.
			-Apparently her father had some history with it.
			-Wizards and priests had already examined it, though, and were unable to find a way.
			-He did speak of one scholar who might know more, an alienist (?), though someone he'd
			 not seen for centuries. . .
				-His name is apparently Zyrastra.
			-He did suggest seeking him out, to which Maya responded, "We'd need to do so in
			 _hours_."
			-After some elvish that was almost certainly expletives by the tone, he fetched
			 something else from his secret compartment: a strange looking carved stone.
			-"This," he said, "Can take you to him. . . whatever plane he may be on. . ."
			-The danger in that was quite clear, and I asked, "Do we have a way to get _back_, Maya?
			  Maybe we could talk to Jade?"
			 "You don't need to come," Maya replied. "Only I'll go, as I need only get a message to
			  him and have _him_ come back. You should stay here, to defend the city."
			 ". . . I'm amenable to that," I said, happy to dodge that danger.
		-With a plan in hand, we took a brief break to clean up for it, scrubbing off the sewer
		 stink.


11/29/23:
	-Once done with our baths, Maya seemed to have had a change of heart about running off to a
	 random plane, and wanted some company.
		-We set in to debating who should stay and who should go.
		-I was none to eager to visit an unkown plane, there being more than a few that I'd. . .
		 rather not.
		-Fortunately Maya _also_ had a very special mission for me in particular: to find a fine
		 wine to send the dwarf who taught she and I that dance.
			-She'd promised him one from Sasserine and, with the city again in danger of going up
			 in flames, she was thinking now might be the time.
			-I enthusiastically accepted that charge.
		-So, we ultimately decided that Jade, D'Roc, Maya, Pook, and Sarge would go search the
		 multiverse for the alienist, while Bruce, Skye, Grimble, and I were going to go to a wine
		 tasting.
	-After watching the away team disappear in a flash of light, and being _very_ intent on my
	 mission, I immediately set off in search of the head of House Dracus's kitchens.
		-I told him that Lady Maya wished to send an especially fine bottle of wine to an
		 acquaintance and asked if he could recommend a wine seller for us.
		-He insisted there was nothing finer in Sasserine than the contents of House Dracus's
		 cellars and led us down to them.
		-There, we ultimately selected a dusty bottle from a very high shelf, which Bruce flew up
		 to retrieve.
		-Brushing the dust away revealed a whole _ecosystem_ in the bottle, with miniature trees and
		 other plants encircling a lake of what indeed appeared to be wine. Fancy!
		-The master of the kitchens was even able to arrange a courier to Sharaar Kol for us, so we
		 gave him the name of our dwarven dance tutor and had him send the bottle to the dwarf care
		 of the tavern at which we met him.
	-That matter settled, the others weren't back yet and the city was quietly preparing for
	 tomorrow's festivals, so those of us in town decided to rest up for the big day.
		-Bruce opted to return to the orphanage, to keep an eye on things there, while the rest of
		 us remained at the Dracus estate.
	-I was rudely awakened in from my wonderful feather-stuffed bed by some clattering and yelling
	 out in the common room of our suite.
		-When shouting, "Keep it down out there!" didn't work, I eventually emerged from bed and my
		 room, yawning and stretching.
		-I found Grimble up, though still in his gnomish pajamas. He and Skye were staring at an
		 out of breath Jade while some skeltons looked on impassively.
		-". . . demons. . . I. . . ran. . ." Jade panted.
		 "Demons?" I asked. "Here? Or. . ."
		 ". . . surrounding the. . . ship," she replied.
		 "Wait. . . _my_ ship?!?"
		 "Ye. . ."
		 "Is the ship OK?!?"
		 ". . . yes. I think so. . ."
		 "Ah, OK. So, tell me more!"
		-Further explanations weren't to be had, though, as Maya's father came running down the hall
		 past our suite, yelling, "Demons are pursuing Maya into the chapel!"
			-He was naturally followed by several guards, and, after a shrug from Fred, us too.
		-By the time we got there, though, the demons were just a pile of tiny, winged corpses at
		 D'Roc's feet (or are there hooves in those boots?).
		-He was bleeding from many small wounds, though, and also rather singed, so several of us,
		 my saintly self included, healed him with various magic items.


12/13/23:
	-Catching up with the away team, they were now intent on "cutting off the pearl's power at the
	 source". Some kind of portal?
		-Hoping for some clarification, I asked, "Well, where _is_ this portal?"
		 "We don't know," Maya replied. "We have a trail."
		 "OK, so, where does the _trail_ start?"
		 "At the pearl," she replied.
		 ". . . Elaborate."
		-Apparently, there were magic traces that _only she could see_, that would lead from one to
		 the other.
			-"This isn't another trap, right, Maya? Like the wine bottle on a string?"
			 "No. . . No no no. . ."
		-Well, against my better judgement, I decided to go with them to destroy the pearl's power
		 source. Destroying stuff can be fun, and the alternative was to stick around and defend
		 the city from various notional threats. . . the city that is more likely to arrest me than
		 accept my help.
	-In fact, most of us went in search of this portal.
		-Skye volunteered to stay and guard Maya's father, to which I added, "Uh. . . Rusty, you
		 stay too, then. . . You're in charge!"
		-The rest of us set off from the estate, following Maya.
		-Once outside, she said the strands of magic led out, over the water, so we headed to the
		 airship docks.
		-Taking the elevator up to them, though, the docks were deserted. It was making me a bit
		 uneasy. . .
			-Well, deserted aside from one ominous, cloaked figure who stared at us while sharpening
			 a knife, but, well, he just kind of sat there as we headed off in the other direction,
			 to my ship.
		-After winding through the docks a bit, we strolled across the gangplank, and were back
		 aboard.
			-"Ah! Home sweet skyship!" I exclaimed.
		-As I started to see to the ship's mooring lines, though, Bruce waved me over.
			-"I heard something come from the front of the ship. . ." he whispered.
			-I frowned, nodded, and then ducked low, beneath the level of the forward deck, and
			 crept up to it.
			-I found no one up there, but, looking over the side, there was a knife embedded in
			 the hull.
			-"Hey! Someone threw a knife at my boat!" I exclaimed.
		-We all began casting our eyes about, looking in particular for the cloaked figure we saw
		 earlier, but couldn't find him.
			-Jade, though, did suddenly call out, pointing at the sky in the opposite direction,
			 yelling, "Vrock!"
			-Apparently a "vrock" is a horrible winged demon-thing, because that was indeed what
			 was swooping down at us out of the sky.
			-Grimble, having a gnome's natural fear of being carried off by a large bird, ducked
			 below decks and began casting a spell.
			-Jade followed with a call to unmoor the ship and get her underway, a thing I
			 enthusiastically set about applying my particular expertise to.
			-That horror flew down, though, and gave an ear-piercing shriek, disorienting all of us
			 nearby.
			-Grimble's cover served him well, though, and he quickly ducked out from it for some
			 anti-air-demon fire, creating a burst of it near the vrock with a shouted word. Sadly,
			 though, the spell served him less well, as it barely singed the vrock's feathers.
			-Crossbow bolts then began to hit the ship (and Maya) from the docks, and the vrock
			 suddenly gained several shimmering compatriots.
			-The demon and it's doubles then swooped down near several of my compatriots, in
			 suspicious unison.
			-Those that could swung at the demons, but only D'Roc connected. . . with what proved
			 to be an illusory double, as his axe blow dispelled it.
			-It remained on deck for only a moment, shaking. . . something, some disgusting flakes,
			 from it's feathers, setting my nearby friends to scratching at their skin. It then flew
			 off again.
				-Gross!
			-Bruce then conjured some weather, concealing us from our attackers with a rain of sleet
			 of the starboard side of the ship.
			-Sarge then saw to their. . . infections, purging it with conjured light and stopping
			 their scratching.
			-That settled, Jade began firing crossbow bolts at the vrock, and Grimble added some
			 more fire, this time to considerable effect, dispelling all the illusions and
			 definitely scorching the vrock.
			-I took the opportunity to run nimbly across the icey deck and untie another mooring
			 line.
			-D'Roc took a different approach, but with the same goal, and cleaved through the
			 remaining rope with his axe.
			-Not willing to make life easy on us, the vrock conjured more demons aboard the now-free
			 ship: a half dozen bulbous, filthy humanoids.
			-Pook poked his head out from below decks to. . . hurl what looked like literal shit
			 at the vrock.
				-On brand, I guess. . .
			-Sarge was right on it, though, knocking them about with some conjured wind.
			-My ship, though, had, with its last mooring line gone, begun to drift. So, I rushed
			 across the deck to the help, dodging a filthy demon claw in the process, and loosed
			 an arrow at the demon standing by the wheel.
			-My arrow did only limited damage to the small demon, but D'Roc's axe cleaved right
			 through it, and into the next one, disabling them both.
			-He then reached out to steady the wheel, while I talked him through it.
			-Doubtlessly enraged by our success, the vrock then swooped down, swiping at D'Roc with
			 its claws, scratching him.
			-That was followed by some shrieking from Pook, who was being assaulted by a small
			 demon. His terror aside, he thrust his dagger forward, eyes closed. . . right into the
			 surprised demon's heart.
				-Pook somewhat spoiled the effect, though, by following that with a loud (and vile-
				 smelling) fart.
			-Maya had disappeared below decks at some point, but it would seem she wasn't spared the
			 excitement, as the sounds of her yelling and blasting things were coming from the cargo
			 hold.
			-I took a moment, then, to have a heart-to-heart conversation with the vrock, saying,
			 "What are you doing, vrock? You're afraid of boats. . ." Sadly, though, the blue winged
			 thing managed to resist my mind trick.
			-It took it's rage out on D'Roc, raking him again and again with his claws.
			-Coming to D'Roc's rescue. . . a pantsless (?!?) Pook ran up the stairs, and hurled more
			 filth. . . over the vrock's shoulder, and thankfully off the ship.
			-That was followed by a (thankfully fully clad) Sarge, running up the same stairs with
			 a sparking hand that he reached out and touched the vrock. . . to no apparent effect,
			 save the closest thing someone with a beak can manage to a smile.
			-A blast from Maya that went wide and more failed mind manipulation from me were no
			 better, but, thankfully, it _did_ prove reasonably vulnerable to D'Roc hacking at it
			 like a tree with his axe, opening several gaping wounds in the beast.
			-Pook then rushed forward, brandishing his dagger and. . . fondling himself. The dagger
			 slid along the beast's scales, rather than piercing, but the demon seemed nearly as
			 disturbed by the fondling as all the rest of us clearly were.
			-There was a bit more back and forth like that, though Pook thankfully kept his hands
			 above his waist.
			-Eventually, though, I let out long string of invectives directed at the bird demon,
			 backed with some psionics. . . and burst it's skull.
			-As it fell to the deck, it faded from view, so that what hit the boards was actually
			 a handful of gems and other, worthless things, stuff that Jade sagely informed us were
			 likely the components used to summon it.
	-The battle settled, and the ship a safe distance now from the docks and whoever was shooting
	 us from them, we licked (well, magically healed) our wounds until Maya called out, "Wings!"
	 while pointing to a speck in the sky.
		-Maya rushed for the spyglass we kept aboard and looking at it, elaborated, "That's a black
		 dragon. I had a dream about that. . ."
		 "A dragon?!? Fuck!" I replied, taking charge of the situation. "Where is it going?"
		 "One is going towards Sasserine, and the other is following us," she said.
		 "Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck. . . What does it want with us? Well, I know what it wants. . ."
		-Pook wisely ran to hide somewhere below deck.
		-Maya estimated we had about 5 minutes until it caught up with us, so we commenced some
		 frantic planning and preparations, including various spells on the party and an illusory
		 pearl from Grimble.
	-Soon enough, it had closed within spell range, but I shouted out, "We'll talk first!" and the
	 others held their fire.
		-Eventually, the huge dragon circled the deck and landed in front of the helm.
		-"To what do we owe the pleasure?" I called out to it in Draconic.
		 "You know what I am here for. Give me the pearl," it replied. "You are clearly the Fred."
		 "The Fred! I certainly am _The_ Fred. Fred the Red! But what about you? Who the Black?
		 "I am The Black Death. Your puny brain cannot fathom my full name. Well. . ." he continued,
		 with a glance to Sarge, "It seems there are _some_ among you not _entirely_ uncultured. . .
		  Speaking of, where is The Platinum Dragon's servant?"
		 "Oh, she's somewhere around here. . . She has wings too, you know, and is a bit flighty."
		 "Hmm. . . The pearl, then. Give me the pearl and you can go on your cowardly way."
		 "Well, I'm amenable to that. . . But, I would need assurances. After all, it's my life on
		  the line, and nothing would stop you from doing as you pleased if I just hand you the
		  pearl. . ."
		 "I do not know how long it would take to find the pearl on the sea floor, but I can
		  certainly find a blue dragon to find it faster than you can grow wings or swim home. . ."
		 the dragon threatened.
		 "Ah, well. . ." I said, drawing the _illusory_ pearl Grimble had made for me forth from
		 my pocket, "Have fun with that, then!"
		-I tossed the illusory pearl (with Grimble adeptly having it follow my movements) over my
		 shoulder and off the ship.
		-The dragon immediately lept off the side of the ship, chasing after the falling "pearl".
		-We took the opportunity to rain down fire on the beast, starting with Grimble very
		 literally doing so, with a fireball. The rest of us followed suit, with various
		 projectiles and spells.
		-It was only a few moments later, though, when the dragon caught the "pearl", discovered my
		 ruse, and turned back to us in anger.
		-It flew up and sprayed its acidic breath over those of us at the stern of the ship.
			-I managed to roll and evade it entirely, while the others were _mostly_ protected by
			 energy reistance Jade had applied.
			-The ship, though, was in a sorrier state, the acid eating into the deck.
				-My ship!
				-Maya and I had to stumble back, as the deck beneath our feet sizzled and fell away.
				-D'Roc, though, had gained some other enhancements from Jade as well, though, and
				 remained hovering in place.
		-Bruce then offered us some cool, refreshing respite, in the form of conjured snow to hide
		 in. Thankfully, he'd _also_ prepared several of us (though not me) with magical ways to
		 see through it.
			-I quickly sought refuge in that, after another mental power failed to affect the beast.
			-Just as D'Roc was charging out of it, in fact, burying his axe in the dragon's flank.
		-I found myself using the stairs for cover, crouched next to an especially tiny Grimble,
		 who made me invisible for good measure.
		-The sounds of battle in fact only continued a few moments more, ending with Maya calling
		 out, "Here's a gift from Bahamut!"
		-As I emerged from the snow, I saw D'Roc presenting one of the dragon's horns, with a fair
		 bit of bloody skull still attached, to Maya.


TODO:
	-Send a message to Sasserine about _their_ incoming dragon, and discuss plans.
	-Temporary, and eventually more permanent, repair of the acid-damaged decking.
	-Push cannons harder.
		-Looking at notes above, they're already mounted on the new ship (one on the left, and two
		 on the right) and in decent shape.
		-So, we just need smoke powder (which Grimble can make, given enough time).


12/27/23:
	-With our dragon dealt with, we set about addressing some immediate concerns.
		-I asked "Ship's Engineer Jade" to address our acid damaged helm and decking.
		-Once that was underway, I then turned to Maya, saying, "We. . . should probably send a
		  message to your father, what with that even bigger dragon on it's way to Sasserine. . ."
			-I provided some pointers as to what our strategy here should be, then went to go help
			 Jade with the helm.
			-She sent:
				"Daddy!! There is a Dragon incoming towards the city. It is beyond a size I have
				 ever seen, black and seems intent to destroy the city."
				"It is after the pearl, it sent a smaller kin against us and we just defeated it.
				 Ah for these last two messages: Raspberry Cupkake!!"
				"We will do our very best to destroy the Pearl through the portal-thing and hope
				 the Dragon will lose interest in you. Raspberry Cupcacke"
				"If all looks bleak for you and Sasserine, tell it about us, maybe it will be more
				 interested in us and ignore Sasserine. raspberry cupcake!"
				"Fredrick wants you to wait with this, but dont. Your life and the citizens are
				 more important than our lives Rasperry Cupcake. Love you....always."
			-Some scowling from me ensued when I returned and read that last bit she had written,
			 over her shoulder.
	-Jade's work plus some assistance from D'Roc and I got the helm back in working order, so I then
	 took control of the ship and got us back on our previous heading, towards the source of the
	 pearl's power.
	-A short while later, we heard back from Sasserine, in the form of Skye's penmanship.
		-It said:
			"Your father is going to take refuge in the vault of the bank, I am going to take
			 command of his men and draw the dragon to the arena. Let's hope neither place becomes
			 a tomb before you all return."
		-Huh. I thought Maya's father had better judgment than that, giving Skye command of troops.
		 He seems skeptical of _me_, after all, which I can't really fault. Then again, were
		 (another, bigger) dragon on it's way towards me, I wouldn't mind being in a bank vault
		 instead of out in front of some troops too. . .
		-They had some further back and forth too:
			"Do any of you know how to kill a black dragon?"
			"A Dragon on the ground is more vulnarable than in the air, try to harm/trap the wings
			 under things? It spits acid in an area."
			"What could it be searching for beneath the waters outside the city?"
			"The pearl? It might not know that we have it."
	-Well, that's mostly out of our hands, and our contribution needed to be racing to that portal.
		-So, while I kept the ship on it's earlier heading, Jade and Maya worked on picking up the
		 magic trail again.
		-They seemed to be struggling a bit with it, giving me intermittent, and occasionally
		 contradictory, directions.
			-It got somewhat better once they had Pook vomit up the pearl itself.
	-Meanwhile, I took a look through the spyglass, towards Sasserine, and saw the dragon hovering
	 over the city's harbor, the water beneath it pushed away with each wingbeat, inundating the
	 city. In the cavity  formed in the water, I could see tentacles emerging from it. . .
		-That warranted another book-message from Maya:
			"There are tentacles coming up from the water outside the city and there is a tsumami
			 wave coming towards you. Cover yourself."
		-And an alarming response:
			"You have a demogorgon coming for you."
		-Or, as Maya keeps referring to it, "Gummy Bear"
			-Admittedly, she's had some issues with bad things happening when she utters the names
			 of demons.
		-Sure enough, Maya looked again through the glass and saw a two-headed, tentacled ape-demon
		 racing through the air towards us, though Jade doubted it was Demogorgon _itself_, saying,
		 "I doubt the demon prince himself is actually here. Probably an avatar. . . though that's
		  plenty bad."
		-That prompted some scrambling.
			-We had Pook swallow the pearl again, which did indeed seem to cause the demon to
			 meander a bit more, trying to follow a fainter trail.
			-Sarge also ran to the caged air elementals, supercharging them with a spell and giving
			 the ship's speed a boost.
	-That speed boost kept the distance between us and the demon steady, but also seemed to be in
	 danger of ripping the ship apart.
		-I was shouting and directing my crew to tie down various things, adjust the sails, and the
		 like, while Jade and Maya frantically tried to keep the improvised repairs together.
		-We were rapidly approaching a small island chain, with some ruined obsidian temples fast
		 becoming visible on the islands, presumably our destination.
	-I was barely in control of the ship at this point and, calling for all the sail adjustments
	 and air elemental action I could to slow things down, I aimed her for the water, hoping for a
	 gentle(ish?) splashdown and that our hull was still intact enough to not take on water.
		-Maya, meanwhile, called her wings into being, grabbed Pook, and lept overboard, soon
		 followed by a potion-chugging Jade.
		-The rest of us hung on tight as the ship hit the water with an impressively graceful splash,
		 some couple hundred feet or so from shore.
		-The ship didn't seem to be taking on water, but also wasn't really meant to maneuver in it.
		-Nonetheless, I attempted to improvise, shouting to those still aboard to, "Reef the lower
		  sails, and angle the mainsail starboard, to catch the breeze!"
		-They attempted to comply, with D'Roc's tremendous strength going a long ways as he
		 descended below decks to pull on the now-disconnected spars controlling some of the lower
		 sails.
		-Between us, we got the ship about 50 feet out from the island, before something snapped and
		 one of the lower sails swung out again, arresting our progress.
		-"Well, I guess we're swimming for it!" D'Roc said, as he lept overboard.
		-I was not about to follow him into the water, a plan that proved wise as the armored man-
		 minotaur proceeded to sink like a stone.
		-"Man overboard!" I called, as I ran to fetch a rope, tying one end to the rail and the
		 other into a loop and tossing it to the bubbles marking D'Roc's last known location.
		-Maya and Bruce also flew over, diving into the water in an attempt to rescue D'Roc.
		-After a fraught few seconds, I felt a tug on the rope, so I wrapped the slack around the
		 anchor chain's winch and began winding it to pull them up.
		-Eventually, all three emerged from the water, and I helped them back aboard the ship.
		-Jade, seeing us all back above the waves, waved at us and pointed to one of the temples,
		 then ran inside.
		-I wasn't about to get in that water myself, so I fetched a few lengths of rope, tied them
		 together, and handed one end to Maya, saying, "Here! Tie this to something on the island
		 while I anchor the other to the ship."
		-We did just that, and soon the three of us still aboard ship without wings were dragging
		 ourselves hand-over-hand along the rope and through the water.
	-Back on dry land, we all followed Jade into that dank, ruined temple.
		-Shortly inside the temple's entrance, though, Bruce called a halt, whispering, "There are
		  voices ahead, around the bend. They're speaking Abyssal, I think. . ."
		-So, we set about performing some (quiet) preparations, Jade healing several of the others
		 while I manifested my precognition.
		-Jade claimed we needed to toss the pearl through the portal, and we began whispered
		 discussion of how to accomplish that.
		-It was interrupted by a thud from behind us.
			-Something hitting the temple's door. Something enormous. . .
		-A moment later, two tentacles smashed through the doors and I started running.
		-Hero that I am, I drew my bow as I did so and loosed an arrow behind me. It pierced one of
		 the tentacles through the center of it's mass and that one withdrew with a sharp jerk.
		-Sarge ran _towards_ them, bravely (but unwisely) hurling spells.
		-Bruce, Grimble, and Pook, though, more prudently ran forward into the tunnel.
		-Grimble, clearly looking to facilitate that, conjured a garguntuan gold dragon, barely
		 small enough to squeeze down the corridor, which he made run down the corridor, roaring
		 and snapping it's jaws.
		-Knowing his specialty and taking his cue, I joined in the fun, yelling, "Get 'em, Gortrax!
		  Kill anything that moves!"
		-Maya began to blast away at the remaining tentacle. Jade dragged her further into the
		 tunnel to as D'Roc ran past them, lopping the end of the tentacle off with his axe,
		 splattering him and Sarge with green goo.
		-I skidded to a halt at the bend in the corridor and cautiously peered past the corner of
		 the wall.
			-Past the (illusion of a) dragon and at the end of the corridor, I could see some kind
			 of winged creature in a cage, being tormented by a swarm of locusts.
		-As the others caught up with me, a demon of some kind emerged from a doorway on the left
		 of the corridor I was looking down. . . and began to "fight" the illusory dragon.
		-Motion down the corridor I came from _also_ then caught my eye. D'Roc was charging at
		 Grimble and I!
			-He had a crazy look in his eyes, and seemed to struggle with himself, but kept his
			 axe lowered.
		-Well, I wanted no part of that, so I dashed past my fellows, towards the dragon illusion
		 and further into the temple.
			-I ended up taking cover in a niche across from the door the demon had emerged from.
			-Through that doorway, I could see more demons, pouring out from a portal. . .
		-"Portal-ho!" I yelled, as I loosed an arrow at the nearby demon. The arrow. . . missed,
		  flying through the tail of the "dragon".
		-The demon saw that, stared at the dragon for a moment, and then turned it's back to the
		 dragon and ran back through the door it came from.
		-Sarge and Bruce then ran forward, over to the dragon, as Grimble ran up next to me.
		-Sarge loosed some kind of energy down the corridor while Bruce conjured more snowfall
		 around himself, providing welcome concealment.
		-Belowing somewhere through the snow, I could hear some demonic voice shouting in their
		 foul language.
		-That was soon joined by Grimble screaming, off to my left, but I couldn't see anything
		 through the snow.
		-Fortunately, the snow soon ceased in part of the room we were in (perhaps Bruce moved his
		 spell, as it continued to snow through the door to the South), revealing Grimble running
		 towards me with a gaping axe wound and a still-crazed D'Roc some distance behind him.
		-He still managed to move his dragon forward into the snow, and Jade rushed after it.
		-Maya approached the D'Roc and tried to talk him down from whatever was going one, reminding
		 him he'd sworn an oath to her father to protect her. It did seem to get through to him, as
		 he slouched, and let his axe fall from his hands.
		-Keeping a wary eye on D'Roc, watching for sudden movements, I sidled over to Grimble and
		 healed him with my magic belt as he did the same with his.
		-Through the snow, I heard a muffled, "Pook is a good boy!" and then there was a big "fwoop"
		 as the snow was blasted away and I was pressed against the wall by the pressure.
		-There, through the doorway, I could see the portal was now gone, and an armless Pook slowly
		 collapsed to the ground.
		-The temple, though, also felt like it was in danger of joining him in that. The burst of
		 air may have done some damage, or there might be some more magical explanation. Either way,
		 it was shaking as stones began to fall from the corridor's ceiling.
		-Grimble quickly barked a few arcane syllables, shrinking to tiny baby size, and I scooped
		 him up and made for the door at Hasted speeds.
		-The others, less wisely, ran the other direction, as Maya shouted, "We need to save the
		  prisoners!"
	-Soon, I stood panting outside the temple's exterior door, holding Grimble, and twenty seconds
	 later, the rest of the party, save poor Pook, emerged, along with. . . some kind of rainbow-
	 winged serpent, a strange winged humanoid, and a giant ant.
		-"You guys made it!" I cried out, ". . . Along with. . . are those more demons?"
		 "No, my child," a. . . voice in my head said, "I was their prisoner, and you saved me."
		 "Oh. Well, that's good, then."
		-Maya then made an entreaty, asking the rescued prisoner for help in saving her city of
		 Sasserine.
		-They said they'd be honored to help, and so we fell to discussing the logistics of that.
			-As the disembodied voice (the winged serpent, I think?) rightfully pointed out, _some_
			 of us could fly, but the others would need some way to get there.
			-I quickly conferred with Jade, but neither of us had a way to repair the ship sooner
			 than a week.
			-The serpent volunteered that it could take us to another plane, but not easily around
			 _this_ plane.
			 "Could you take us to another plane and back to Sasserine?" Jade asked.
			 "It is. . . not that accurate," it responded. "I could take you to Sigil, maybe? The
			  city of doors? It's renowned for it's portals."
			 "Does it. . . have bars?" I asked.
			 "More than can be counted."
			 "Alright! That's the plan for me!"
			-The others were still insistent on a route back to Sasserine, though, so the serpent
			 then volunteered that it could fly somewhere and fetch us a scroll or the like.
			-"Well," I volunteered, "There's the goblins?"
			 "You have goblins?" the serpent asked.
			 "And a spare ship too!"
			-I described for the creature where I'd left the goblins and their airship, saying,
			 "Tell them Fred needs a ride, and that there's good booze in it for them!"
			-We went with that, though Maya was not content to wait, and took off after the serpent,
			 flying a good deal slower, but heading the same direction.
	-Soon enough, I could see the goblin's derigible hanging above the horizon, and heading for us.
		-They took us aboard and we headed back to Sasserine.
	-There, we found a city devestated by the dragon atack: buildings clawed, drenched in acid, or
	 damaged by flooding, and bodies in the streets.
		-We eventually found Skye, who the city's people were hailing as a hero for driving off the
		 dragon.
			-I asked him how that felt, but he glowered, and replied, "Don't talk to me. For several
			 days."
				-I shrugged, grabbed a wine bottle from my pack, and began drinking, sharing with
				 those around me.
				-One of the Dracus house guards I offered a swig to gestured to Skye, saying Skye
				 nearly died in the battle with the dragon, but that they rivived him.
					-That might explain Skye's dark mood, given his glorification of death. Though
					 there's also Pook's demise, strangers talking to him, and many other Skye-
					 annoyances.
				-Maya insisted on trying to give Skye some kind of pep talk, but I quickly wandered
				 off.
		-We then dispersed from there, each of us helping the city and it's residents in our own
		 ways.
			-I did some light looting, wandering the streets drinking and grabbing refills as needed.
				-I pressed many of those I passed to have a drink too, with mixed results as the
				 city's populace each mourned their ills in their own ways.
		-In the immediate aftermath, the next few days, there was lots of rebuilding, and other
		 changes.
			-House Dracus's power in the city surged, as it's lord emerged unharmed from the bank
			 and he and Maya both took leading roles in rebuilding.
				-Maya even reached out to the king of Sharaar Kol, asking for the assistance of
				 it's dwarven craftsmen. They came after a few days, and assisted greatly in the
				 process.
				-I also heard her discussing with Sarge the rebuilding of the city's defenses.
					-He had offered to help train new soldiers, and she also asked him if any like
					 him would be willing to come take service with the city too. They made plans
					 to seek out other dragonborn veterans and hire them as mercenaries.
			-My own name ended up cleared too, as all of us were hailed as heroes of the city.
				-They insisted on no speeches, though.
				-"Fine, fine. . ." I replied. "How about a toast, then?"
			-Jade went and saw to her adoptive family of orphans, funding and assisting in the
			 construction of another structure for the orphanage.
			-D'Roc too did some construction, putting his (enormous) back into it, and picking up
			 some carpentry skills.
			-After the first day or three of binge drinking I. . . well, I kept drinking, but did
			 a lot of talking with the various members of the city's populace.
				-I talked up the air-sailing lifestyle, and the wonders of my own adventures.
			-My airship, though, was a more or less total loss.
				-We salvaged what we could of it and, with all the set aside funds in the ship's
				 account, plus some more out of our own pockets, we set Jade to building a new one.


TODO:
	-(DONE!) Level up!
	-(DONE!) Grimble spells.
	-More followers?
		-I did a bunch of talking with now-displaced people in the city about the wonders of the
		 air life.
		-(DONE!) Does my self-promotion during downtime qualify for Leadership bonuses?
			-"Great renown +2", or even "Special power +1": https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Leadership
				-"So then I kills the demon. With my brain! His head fuckin' exploded!"
			-Asked about it here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1190081918746775652
				-Yep, I have Great Renown, but not Special Power: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1190806988930678795
		-(DONE!) Perhaps elementals now? Building a new ship, I can no longer claim as easily that _I_
		 didn't have anything to do with binding them to _this_ one.
			-Sent Jake this, discussing flavor stuff and rulings both: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1190548817230184458
				More follower questions, @.dmjake, for whenever you have a chance!
				It seems that, with this level and with the destruction of the original ship, it's time for me to figure out air elementals. I figure that Fred keeps telling himself, and starts telling the air elementals, that _he_ wasn't the one who bound this elemental to the ship. It was The Brotherhood! And that jerk Edric really dicked _Fred_ over too. . .
				But! That does rather fall apart if he builds a _new_ ship and has them or new elementals bound for his new ship. So, it's probably time to renegotiate the deal with them now.
				Basically, I want Fred to sell them on a bit of a shared enemy/problem (Edric), a shared goal (freedom), and also play to their pride ("What is a wind without something to blow? And what could be cooler than blowing a sick fuckin' pirate ship through the skies?!? You could be _pirate_ elementals. . ."). His aim is to recruit them as crew, rather than bind them as an engine. He sympathizes with their plight ("Hey, you're kind of like me! I _love_me!") and also figures a free elementals are likely to do a better job with the ship (he knows all about doing the bare minimum you can get away with).
				To do that, though, we need to do some house ruling. Small Air Elementals intelligent creatures with two hit dice, but they don't have a printed level adjustment and probably deserve a point or two of it. As far as what followers I can have right now, you mentioned Squee  always counts as my highest level slot, so I can have 1 level 3 follower slot free and 3 level 2 ones that might work for the elementals. If I have at least the Great Renown bonus mentioned in the comment I replied to, then I could have an extra of each level.
				_Are_ the elementals powering the ship small? Is there one, or several?
			-6 small ones power the ship: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1190806279749378129
			-We'll treat their HD as their ECL: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1190807250554585279
			-So, Fred can only have 4 level 2 followers. . . but does have room for another 2 level
			 _3_ ones.
				-So, this can be made to work!
				-Can I give two of them _level_ then? Maybe personally train them as pirates?
				-Asked about it here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1191127164997861376
				-Yep! Talked about it in session! Giving two of them a rogue level.
					-Feat?
						-Dodge is what they'd get for more elemental HD, and probably wise otherwise too.
					-Oh! Cutlasses or scimitars are flavorful, but reach could be _amazing_ with 
					 Flyby Attack!
						-Oh, no scimitar proficiency for rogues. Not sure where to find a cutlass.
							-Looked up a cutlass and it's basically a shortsword.
					-Lets do a rapier, because of Finesse, and consider keeping longspears about.
					-5 skillpoints to spend.
						-Tumble! Profession(Sailor)!
			-Customize the new ship to suit them?
				-Comfort and the like, but also maybe a way to safely land it, so they can leave it?
				-Proposed it here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1194046884872999072
		-(DONE!) Asked if the cloak will be completed here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1027415547278794782/1189981568626868285
			-It's finished!
		-(DONE!) What about those gnome mimes? Are they level 1?
			-Yep, level 1!
			-If so, what class? Bard? Expert?
				-If bards, Gnome Bard varient is good: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/bard.html#gnome-bard
				-75% experts, 25% PC classes (bard will be my choice): https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1190809555085557770
			-Asked about them here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1190552221696405514
				-They indeed get the standard 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8 array discussed on DMG pg. 169. 
			-Attractive feats:
				-Extra Music (for the Bards): https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/eberron-campaign-setting--12/extra-music--1025/index.html
				-Jack of All Trades (for the Experts): https://dnd.arkalseif.info/feats/complete-adventurer--54/jack-of-all-trades--1695/index.html
		-Some of these followers potentially have interesting gear. . .
			-The gnomes have one or more wagons.
			-Then there's the goblin airship.
				-Shit, does it pose air elemental relations issues?
			-Probably need to start writing this kind of thing down in it's own spot.
				-"Gear Elsewhere" or the like, with standard location-name-and-contents format
				-In fact, should write down out main airship's attributes somewhere too, with it's 
				 20k value.
	-Talk to Jake about income gained during downtime:
		-Brief discussion of the subject here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1027415547278794782/1190043459864756395
		-We have a year of downtime, picking back up at next Founding Day.
		-Perform actually could produce a substantial amount of gold for you: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/perform.htm
			-Almost certainly more than profession.
	-Other downtime stuff?
		-Definitely spend lots of time promoting your own reputation, and helping the others bask
		 in your reflected glory.
		-Shopping?
			-Basic protective items?
		-Alchemy (beyond the smoke powder)?
			-Fire and acid?
			-In particular, for use by followers, aboard ship, etc.


1/10/23: A brief session, handling some of the details of our long downtime.
	-I helped Jade negotiate some deals for a magic shop she set up during our year in Sasserine.
		-She also did some humanitarian activities along the way, especially in the days following
		 the dragon attack, crafting magic items to help, like a decanter providing endless fresh
		 water.
		-She also put together a magic lute that builds stuff, which Maya put to good (and good
		 sounding) use.
		-And, of course, she put together our new ship, even making some improvements for
		 _cooperative_ elementals crewing it.
			-Fantasy Grounds now has some Airship maps, with a fancy interior.
	-Sarge left Sasserine for much of the year, in search of further arcane learning.
		-He came back with tales of not _too_ distant locales, like Glyphstone Keep, the city of
		 Wroat with it's many magical wonders, and the volcano he visited.
	-D'Roc, on the other hand, hung around Sasserine. Between his prodigious strength and,
	 apparently, some carpentry experience, he was a lot of help with rebuilding the city.
		-I also heard him and Maya discussing the mystery of his origins, with her helping him do
		 some research on the subject.
		-He did a bit of a field trip for that too, going off alone into the wilds outside the city.
			-He came back calm and confident.
	-Maya, meanwhile, busied herself with politics.
		-The Dawn Council's power, in the wake of this disaster, had really waned. She spent a lot
		 of time pushing for changes to the city's government, with an eye to more of a voice for
		 the city's common people.
	-As for myself. . .
		-The city's party scene was something of a disappointment for the first few months after
		 the attack.
		-Nonetheless, where no party is to be found, I can create one, and I set about doing (a lot
		 of) just that!
		-During the day, though, most of the city busied itself with rebuilding, a process I watched
		 a lot of when I was awake for it.
		-While roaming one of the construction sites, I spotted the one, the only Party Lizard,
		 carrying lumber.
			-"Party Lizard!" I called out. "How have you been?!?"
			 "Fred! I've been good. These elves I'm here with are really chill."
			 "You'll have to introduce me! Let me find some wine. . ."
			 "Ah," he replied, "What I could really go for is some of those sausages. . . Do you
			  remember?"
			 "Oh yeah! What was that bar. . . Oh! The Lusty Leper!"
			 "Yeah, that place was great! I wonder if it's still standing. . . Well, there's one fun
			  way to find out!"
		-We sought out our old stomping grounds and found the Lusty Leper still intact.
			-It had a picture of a cat on it's sign, though, for some reason. . .
			-Bursting through the front door, I found the place dead and depressing, but immediately
			 called out, "Look who I found! It's the party lizard!"
			 "Woah!" the barkeep exclaimed. "I love that guy!"
			-There was a bard in one corner playing a desultory tune, but I turned to Grimble,
			 saying, "Fetch your kin! We need some more entertainment!"
			-He returned less than a wine bottle, a dozen or so gnomes in tow. I spotted one
			 carrying a lute and I called to him, "Hey! Play something with a fast tempo! Dance
			 music!"
			-When the gnome complied, I turned to Party Lizard, saying, "Come on, lets get the
			 dancing started!"
			-Soon, the bar was crowded. There were gnomes swinging from the chandelier and Party
			 Lizard had one in each of his saddle-bag-like things he'd taken to wearing.
			-By the end, I'd had a great time, and even figured out a new trick (Harmonic Shot).
	-TODO: Skye? Lesley is indeed putting a new character together. . .


TODO:
	-(DONE!) Stat out elementals rogues and gnomes, from last set of todos above.
	-Fanaticize the party? Followers too?
		-Well, how does repeating this work? Possibly a Jake question.
		-Maybe a lavish Founders Day Party Party?
			-I put feelers out: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1190044737026134098/1198097668459733012
		-Invite the party lizard!


1/24/23:
	-In the lead up to Founders Day, and a party I planned to host for it, I heard a voice in my
	 head: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1199512833583493180
		-"A chosen of mystra said I should rendevous with all of you to return the piece of mt.
		  celestia's 6th layer from whence it came. I will meet you on your ship or in Jade's
		  emporium, what is your preference? Sorry if this is presumptive, I learned long ago not
		  to question the word of mystical oracles conveniently delivering quests... Oh, I'm Lucien.
		  You'll know me when you see me." 
		-Since it sounded like I could respond, I said aloud, "Disembodied voice, eh? No worries;
		 we get _tons_ of those. And, yeah, I _did_ once trade some river ham to someone claiming
		 Mystra chose her. For some magic eyeballs! Never been to any celestial mountain, and don't
		 much care for layers, but, fuck it, we're having a Founder's Day party. Swing by then and
		 we can talk about it! I'm still sorting the location, but, sure, Jade can collect you form
		 her shop Bring liquor!."
		-(We're introducing a new player, and it sounds like Lesley is bowing out.)
	-I rented the Lusty Leper for my party, and arranged food and booze through them.
		-It was a lavish banquet, attended by the the party lizard, the party, and our various
		 hangers-on, and I wasted no time getting it started the moment I arrived at the bar.
		-The rest trickled in over time, with Jade and D'Roc arriving with a stranger: a man with
		 white hair. . . and red horns.
			-Well, I suppose D'Roc has a pair too. . .
		-The stranger _did_ have welcome gifts: a bottle of black liquor and cupcakes.
		-The trio were greeted by another trio, this one of gnome mimes.
			-The gnomes, in their mismatched theatrical garb mimed astonishement at their arrival,
			 and then began to perform cartwheels around them.
			-They were no mere entertainment, though, but guests themselves, as one made clear by
			 grabbing the stranger's liquor bottle and running off with it.
			-The gnome uncorked it as he ran, then took a swig.
			-It was evidently strong, as the gnome near-instantly began to stumble. . . right into
			 one of the air elementals whose buffeting winds hurled the gnome across the room.
				-Fortunately one of his fellows was near at hand, caught the bottle, and ran off
				 while holding it high over his head.
			-I was busy stacking gnomes on the party lizard, but the flying gnome caught my
			 attention (and ruined my high score attempt in a gnomish avalanche).
			-Turning and seeing the new arrivals and, perhaps more importantly, the fancy looking
			 bottle of one of the mimes was holding overhead, Fred called out, yelling, "Buddy!
			 Bring me that bottle!"
			-The gnome delivered, and I started drinking (this, instead of the wine bottle in my
			 other hand).
				-The black liquor was. . . intense, and strong.
		-The horned man followed his bottle over, and began, "An oracle, chosen by Mystra said you
		 could. . ."
		 "Oh! You're the voice in my head!" I broke in.
		 ". . . I'm Lucien. I was asked to return a piece of Mount Celestia to where it came from,
		  and was told you'd seen something in the dwarven city of Sharaar Kol."
		  "Yeah. . . come to think of it. . . Sarge! When we found that river ham. . . I do recall
		  things went weird. We were suddenly on a mountainside. . ."
		-Jade then called for our attention, shouting, "Guys? Guys! It's gotten really quiet
		 outside. . ."
		 "You need more music, you're saying?" I slurred, but our horned stranger drew his blade.
		-Jade, Maya, and the stranger all went to the window next to the door, peering out through
		 it's curtains. Jade then turned back to the room, and simply said, "Demons."
		 "My family. . ." the stranger added.
		-Two imps then came crashing through the window, swiping at Jade, and things became chaotic.
		-Bruce conjured a snowstorm outside as the party rushed to the windows and began battling
		 the winged demons that were pouring in.
		-Soon, the little demons were joined by a winged woman, one who looked to be at least half
		 a demon herself.
		-"Oh dear Lucien. . ." the woman began.
		 "Oh. Hello," the horned stranger replied.
		 "Your friends don't seem to know how to welcome one such as I properly. . . 
		-His response was to stab her with his sword, eliciting a wince from her, and then an attack
		 with a blade of her own. Soon, the two of them were trading blows, with some punches from
		 Sarge in the mix (he having turned his fist to stone somehow).
			-One such stoney swing went wild, smashing a nearby door off it's hinges.
		-The party lizard, meanwhile was snapping at one of the imps, as it tried to stab him with
		 it's tail.
		-I loosed an arrow at one of the imps in a shattered window as I darted for cover behind
		 the bar.
		-Finally, things calmed down as the the party lizard got his imp (it was now hanging limp
		 from his jaws, much like a hunting dog with a bird) and Lucien diced the demon-woman to
		 bloody pieces.
		-"Good bye, sister," he said.
		-While I had another cupcake, Lucien (apparently) began kicking through the bloody remains
		 of what was apparently what was once his sister.
			-Jade eventually joined him in that, muttering something about auras as she looked
			 through her magic monocle.
			-Out of the bloody mess, they pulled a note and a large red gem.
			-While Jade muttered something about astral projection and the gems use therein, Lucien
			 simply said, "See you soon, sister." Sounds like the matter isn't settled. . .
		-With everyone standing around, surveying the mess, I felt my intervention was needed. I
		 clambered up onto the bar and called for the attention of those there.
		 "Friends!" I called out. "Are we going to let _this_ stop us? This city has been good to
		  us! It even loved me so well as to put up all those posters with my face on them! And this
		  day, this is Founders Day! A celebration of the city. . . So lets celebrate!"
			-(I rolled a 53 on Diplomacy. . .)
		-Soon, we were back to it, with gusto! I seemed to have really riled the crowd up.
			-With the bars doors smashed, the public was also streaming in, making it truely crowded.
		-The troupe of gnomes launched into a fast, heavy number, and Lucien even climbed up onto
		 the stage and began singing in a raspy voice as the crowd began to mosh.
		-The barkeep soon came downstairs, shouting, "What's going on here?"
		-In response, the crowd _roared_ back.
		-"Uh, sure, carry on. . ." the barkeep said. "Just, uh, fix those doors, maybe?"
		 "Get more booze!" I called to him. "I think we've got even more coming in!"
		 "It _is_ more crowded than it's been. . . ever. Uh, sure, let me see what I can do," the
		 barkeep said, as he continued past me to the cellar.
		-Maya did, though indulge his request and the spirit of the party both, pulling out her
		 Lute of Building, effecting repairs and adding to the music both!
		-As I stood on the bar, calling encouragement to the musicians, I overheard Jade strike up
		 a conversation with Lucien.
			-"You wouldn't happen to know of any diamond deposits, by any chance?" she asked.
			 "Diamonds? Why this in particular?" Lucien replied. "Does someone require
			  resurrection?"
			 "Well, that part's taken care of," Jade answered. "But we promised we'd help them
			  replace the diamonds."
			-Lucien looked thoughtful for a moment, and then said, "I've heard tales of a diamond
			  mine given over to the force of good, in a long ago pact. . ."
			-This rang an unwelcome bell for me. I'd heard such tales too. . . back in the creche.
			 Tales of _The Brotherhood's_ pact that secured a great diamond mine on a distant plane,
			 but also saw the opening of portals to The Hells, and a "Demiplane of Gloaming". . .
			-I felt I needed to break in, saying, "I've heard of the place, a place of hell and
			 gloaming. I'd suggest steering clear of The Brotherhood and its works. It's best. . .
			 for everyone."
			-Jade had not been taking my advice and, looking uncomfortable, she pulled out her orb,
			 saying, "Uh. . ."
				-Ugh. I'd half managed to forget the thing existed. . .
			-I grimaced, and looked back to the party and the stage, but Jade explained to Lucien
			 that the thing was tied to The Brotherhood, a circle of ascended gods, and that it
			 could work strange powers when keys to The Brotherhood's planes were inserted into
			 it.
			-I began drinking harder. . .
	-Eventually, it came time for sleep.
		-Most, perhaps all, of us took rooms above the bar.
		-When I awoke, there was still a good sized mob of people waiting for me, some immediately
 		 outside my door, and others downstairs. The moment I emerged from my room, one asked me,
		 "Where's the next party?" bringing a smile to my face, despite the hangover.
			-I'd clearly made quite the impression last night.
		-That smile clearly delighted several women among them, one of whome said, "Ohhh! Fred is
		 _so_ dreamy. . ."
		 "I know baby. I love me too," I replied
		-Making my way down to the bar below, I saw several of my fellows well into breakfast
		 already.
		-I poured myself a smallbeer and sat down with them, inquring with the staff about some
		 food.
		-Then, as I waited for some food, I turned to the fawning crowd around me and said, "I
		  think the next party is in Sharaar Kol! You wouldn't expect it, but those dwarves can
		  dance. Let's liven up those dwarven halls. . "
		 "Oh! Can you take us with you Fred?" someone in the crowd called out.
		 Another shouted, "Is there room?"
		-Lucien muttered something about having spent 40 gold on an airship passage, sparking a
		 discussion amongst the party.
		-I thought we could probably fit as many aboard the ship as fit in the bar, for at least
		 a little while.
		-Soon, we had paying passengers. 57 of them, in fact, each paying 100 gp. a head for the
		 party cruise!
	-Soon, we were leading an increasingly drunk (again) mob back to the airship.
		-There Rusty greeted us.
		-"Rusty! Buddy!" I said. "How's my ship?"
		 "All is well," he intoned. "It's a very fine ship. Though, I confess, I sometimes miss
		  the old one. . ."
		 "Naaaah. This is a much better ship," I said. "I like better where it came from."
		 "The old one was as gift, was it not?" Rusty asked.
		 "Gifts can be poisoned, buddy. . ."
		 "That I know."
	-During the voyage, Lucien called Sarge, D'Roc, and I over, offering a glass of "Abyssal
	 Temptation, as he named the remainder of his black liquor.
		-As we drank, he asked each of us about ourselves.
		-"Well," I began. "I came from a place far, far away. It's terrible. Never go there. But,
		  then I came to Sasserine, and quickly became it's most famous sometimes-denizen. They
		  love me! They were putting up pictures of me all over town, inviting me to all the best
		  funerals. . . It's been great!"
		-Sarge then began to talk of his origins in Stormreach, while I downed my glass all at once
		 and then interrupted, asking Lucien, "Got any more?"
		-That was the point, though, that I noticed the crystalline constructs on my shoulders, one
		 horror on each. . .
			-"Get them off!" I yelled, swatting at my shoulders and eliciting confused looks from
			 the others.
				-It did no good, though, as the ectoplasmic constructs grew _hooks_, and dug into
				 my shoulders.
			-Sarge finished his own drink as he stared. . . and was soon joining me in looking at
			 his shoulders in horror.
			-I eventually fumbled my rapier free of it's sheath, muttering, ". . . have to. . . cut
			  them out. . ."
			-That's when people started towards me, but not before I stabbed myself in the shoulder.
			-Someone took the rapier from me and Lucien approached me, trying to. . . mean-mug one
			 of the constructs?
			-I grabbed him by the shoulders, shouting, "You fool! Constructs don't know feeaaar!"
			-I then fell down.
			-After a bit, the constructs and whatever plagued Sarge, faded. I presume them to have
			 been the effects of this vile liquor.
			-Still, though. Even after the constructs were gone, I felt like I was being watched.
				-Ugh.
				-"Have any more of that?" I asked Lucien.
				 ". . . we can get more."


1/29/24:
	-The parties (adventuring and dance) continued on through the skies.
		-A. . . couple(?) days (the boundries between them were quite fuzzy) into the journey, we
		 crossed the coast and were over land. Soon, the mountains were in sight, and we'd be at
		 Sharaar Kol in a day and half.
		-That prompted a new Fred-suggestion: "See! We're almost there! So, new game! See a
		 new mountain? Drink!"
		-Shockingly, Jade sort-of listened, pulling out that bottle of Lucien's.
			-Apparently she held onto the dregs.
			-She eyed the bottle hesitently, then uncorked it and downed what was left.
			-Soon, she fell to the deck, mumbling about her godmother and. . . mob? Mab?
			-Lucien went to try and comfort her, while I laughed, shouted, "That's good stuff,
			 huh?!?" and then wandered off with my hangers-on, suggesting they throw empties over
			 the side of the ship while I try to shoot them out of the sky with my bow.
	-Eventually, we reached Sharaar Kol.
		-As we docked at the city's airdocks, a runner from the king whisked away Maya, with Sarge
		 accompanying her, for meetings concerning the kingdoms latest aid package for Sasserine
		 in the wake of the flooding. (Boring. . .)
			-(Mathias and Bram couldn't make this session.)
		-As our next order of business, I led the party and our crowd or revelers to the tavern
		 where Maya and I learned that dance.
			-I went straight to the bar, to discuss some ale and food.
			-With that order in, I turned to the new guy and asked, "So, Lucien. . . you were looking
			  for a rock? For that Mystra girl?"
			 "A rock? I don't know about a rock?" he replied.
			 "You said something about a piece of a mountain?" I clarified.
			 "It's a piece of a _plane_," he said, "It would have felt annoyingly good. . ."
				-That last prompted some debate between Jade and Lucien about if goodness could be
				 "annoying" or not.
			-The conversation eventually did circle back around to business: river ham business.
			-Those of that were there recounted our encounter with the ham, and described the way
			 we reached it, through the mines.
			-Sarge also mentioned something about "instability", though I got the impression he was
			 talking about something more arcane than a cave-in.
	-With some food and (more) drink in me and a general outline in mind, we ditched the partygoers
	 at the tavern to enjoy the dancing and left my followers stretched between there and the ship
	 to go in search of supplies.
		-With great approval from me, Lucien found two more bottles of that Abyssal booze, down in
		 the lower city.
		-Sarge also hit one of the dwarvern forges, to get some shiny new armor.
	-With that, we were off to the mines!
		-I _totally_ knew where we were going, though the rest of the party wasn't all that sure.
		-Lucien, at least, despite not having been there himself, did a good job of following my
		 excellent instructions, knowing immediately what I meant about going left "at the area
		 that smelled bad. . . eggs and. . . purple?".
		-Soon, we were well on the way to the site of our wild magic accident. . . 
		-. . . though we also seemed to soon be missing Sarge?!?
		-So, we did some backtracking. Lucien was pretty confident he could follow our own
		 footsteps, and soon we found Sarge, a short distance down a passage that forked from our
		 own.
		-From there, we continued on, following my (definitely perfect) recollections and
		 descriptions.
	-Eventually, we arrived at the carved stone walls that marked the site of our river ham
	 adventure.
		-There, in the first chamber of the ruin, we found our "Chosen" glow-in-the-dark lady.
		-She greeted all of us warmly, and then quickly launched into the technical details of the
		 mess on her hands.
		-"The transposed bit of Celestia," she said, "Has mixed with the river of chaotic magic
		  here, leading to a. . . small universe creation event."
		 "How small?" I asked, "Like, breadbox?"
		-She tried to explain, prompting a flury of questions from Jade.
		-I tuned back into the discussion when Jade mentioned something about that time crystal.
			-Apparently, what we have on our hands is basically a font of Chaotic Good, and Jade
			 had ideas about how she might duplicate that time crystal using its energies.
		-The Chosen went on, saying that there were portals opening in the area at random.
			-She said she'd sent in a magical scout, and from it learned that there now were four
			 minor primordial planes overlapping with the area.
			-"Each of them," she claimed, "Is tied to a champion. . . or, well, better: a beast.
			  Defeat the right ones and we can set things right."
			-She told us we needed to destroy the fire and air champions, leaving earth and water.
			-She also then began to explain that we could get _in_ via the portals. . . prompting
			 a flurry of questions from us about how we get _home_.
			-By way of response, she handed Lucien a strange, intricately carved. . . statuette?
			 "It contains a spell of Return," she said.
			-Lucien turned it over in his hands, looking at it, and then handed it to Jade.
			-Bruce then interjected, "If these beings are elementals, and so strongly tied to these
			 planes, they may be invincible on their own planes. . ."
			 "Yes," The Chosen replied. "You will need to bring them to another plane before they
			  may be struck down."
			-That, of course, prompted some consternation, but these random portals seemed likely
			 to provide some opportunities.
		-We then discussed the matter of motivation. "Lady," I said, "Last time you gave me some
		  magic eyes. Got any more? I could use a third. . ."
		 Nonplussed, she responded, "Yes, last time I granted you darkvision. What boon is it that
		  you now wish?"
			-We fell to discussing the matter, but Lucien was quickest to speak to her, saying that
			 he wished to increase his power, the power of his very soul.
			 After only a moments thought, she offered, "Well, there is a kind of enchanted tome
			  that can grant what you seek. I can provide you with such a thing."
			-Jade, then, asked for something a bit more material: materials. Ones with which she
			 could create the time crystal she envisioned, explaining her plan to the interested
			 (if seemingly slightly concerned) woman.
			 "Yes, I believe I can provide you with a suitable crystal," the nodding Chosen replied.
			-Finally, subdued (for me) and almost a bit reluctantly, I asked, "Can you. . . make me
			 immortal?"
			 "That. . . is forbidden," she said. "It is against the natural laws."
			 "Shit, I do _plenty_ of stuff that's against the law," I tried to reason with her. "Most
			  of the fun stuff _is_!"
			 ". . . I cannot do that to you. . . I cannot grant that request."
			 "Hmph. . . Fine. . . I'll take the self-improvement. . . Ugh, have to read a book. . ."
	-A minute or so later, a portal appeared.
		-Lucien and Bruce inspected the portal closely, and Lucien pronounced it as not one of our
		 targets, instead describing a "place of mazes".
		-Jade began to ask The Chosen if the portal could be stabilized, but it was gone before Jade
		 finished speaking. "Damn," she said. "I bet D'Roc would have been really interested in that
		 one. . ."
		-That repeated for quite some time, portals randomly appearing and disappearing every few
		 minutes until my companions pronounced a portal promising.
			-Bruce took some of that time to cast his Snowsight spell on myself and most of the rest
			 of the party.
	-We popped through the promising portal. . . into a flaming hellscape.
		-We were perched atop one of several rocky crags strewn around a sea of bubbling magma.
		-I stood close to Jade, whispering, "If it gets much hotter, we're getting the hell out of
		  here, right?"
			-That mostly earned me a frown.
		-Eventually, we got the impression that something was _in_ the sea of magma. From time to
		 time a. . . blob of flaming matter would leap from it and then dive back in, like a fish.
		-Lucien began yelling at it as menacingly as possible, growling, "Hey. _You_. . ."
			-I followed his cue, shouting, "Yeah! You don't want to mess with him. . ."
		-That got a definite response, as again a flaming mass lept from the magma, this time
		 landing on the rock in front of Lucien and staying still enough that we could see it was
		 some kind of vaguely wolf-shaped fire elemental.
		-It snapped at Lucien who danced back from it's flaming jaws just barely in time.
		-Bruce then conjured snow, presumably obscuring us (though his Snowsight countered it for
		 me) and _definitely_ pissing the fire-wolf off.
		-Though not so much as when Lucien, with his own Snowsight, began to hack away at the beast
		 with his blade, causing it to grow not just angrier but also substantially bigger. . .
		-Sarge then pelted it with some conjured ice of his own, briefly turning its eyes towards
		 him, but they were quickly back on Lucien as he smacked it with his sword again.
			-Neither attack, though, seemed to cause any real harm.
		-I then began some yelling of my own at it, shouting, "Bad puppy! See what happens when you
		  try to bite strangers?!? Bad dog!"
			-That earned me some sheepish puppy-dog eyes, but it quickly turned back to snarling at
			 Lucien.
		-I was beginning to see the futility of our situation, but Sarge then called out an idea,
		 yelling, "This plane! It's fire! Charge it with more of that energy and maybe we can force
		  another planar link!"
		 "So. . . lets burn this motherfucker down!" I shouted, looking to Grimble.
		-Sarge was quick to follow his own advice, though, muttering arcane syllables and conjuring
		 a burst of glame in the center of our rock, one that revealed a shining portal as it
		 dissipated.
		-"It's neutral!" Bruce called out, after quickly inspecting it. "That's what we need!"
		 "So, dive on through?!?" I asked.
		 "Yes!" Sarge responded.
		-I shrugged and did just that, with Grimble pumping his tiny legs behind me.
		-On the other side of the portal, we found ourselves ankle deep in a fountain, in the midst
		 of some kind of garden.
		-We wasted no time diving behind some nearby benches, which proved prudent as Lucien and the
		 fire elemental came through seconds after us.
		-The rest of the party followed them through and that devolved into a flurry of attacks from
		 both sides, with me popping up from behind my bench to add my shots.
		-The mess continued for some time until the firey beast fell to cinders under our assault.
	-Now free to look around a bit more, we found the garden we stood in to be a maze of hedges.
		-We could walk across the area in minutes, Bruce, from the air, assured us, and said that,
		 on the plane, the garden was seemingly all there was.
		-He also informed us that, in clearings, there stood four statues, each with the symbols 
		 of one of the four elements.
		-We naturally sought out the air one and, finding it, began to speculate about ways of
		 keeping a portal open.
		-No great option presented itself though, so, as Jade asked if anyone had air magic
		 available to them, Sarge volunteered that he had us covered.
		-Before stepping through, I suggested we perhaps try an alternate plan, and take a softer
		 approach.
			-"That way we don't have to use you as bait, Lucien," I offered.
			-They seemed willing to try it! And we could always _fall back_ to risking Lucien's
			 life. . .
		-Planning settled, Sarge conjured a wind that swirled about the statue, soon forming a
		 portal from its swirling and now glowing energies.
		-We then stepped through it one by one.
	-Through the portal, we found a clearly air-aligned plane plane: more rocky pillars, these
	 separated by cloudy voids and buffetted by wind and lightning.
		-I set about putting my plan into action, calling out (the Auran equivalent of), "Yoo hoo!
		  Anybody out there? We've got snacks. . .", putting all the call-a-puppy-over energy into
		 it that I could muster.
		-The response I got was. . . less than what I had hoped for, as a huge giant clambered up
		 one of the pillars some distance from ours, grabbed a rock the size of my head and hurled
		 it straight at me, hitting me square in the chest.
		-"Oof!" I said, clutching my chect. "You. . . bastard. . . I just. . . offered you snacks. . ."
			-Grimble rushed over and healed me with his magic belt, taking some of the sting away.
		-I, though, was still _pissed_. I _glared_ at the thing, as a buzzing built in my head, and
		 then in the heads of those around me. "Knock. . . that. . . shit. . . out!" I yelled at the
		 giant. . . and he did. In fact, he stopped moving at all.
		-"Alright, folks!" I called out a moment later. "Now we wait for a portal! He's not going
		  anywhere. . ."
		-We then fell to discussing options for reaching the giant on his somewhat distant pillar.
		-Jade provided Lucien and I the means to fly, so Grimble rendered himself tiny and I
		 strapped him to my chest, then the pair of us, Lucien, Bruce, and Sarge all flew over to
		 the giant's pillar.
			-I got a lightening strike for my trouble, and nearly lost control of the giant's mind,
			 but managed to hang onto my power through shear force of will.
		-There, Bruce volunteeered that he had a handy spell to trigger a portal but, before he
		 could cast it, one opened near Jade, across a chasm from us.
			-Sarge asserted we can't likely open a _second_ portal while that one is open, and Jade
			 called over to us that this one looked suitable for our purposes, so we began to debate
			 how to move the giant to the portal.
			-Ultimately, Sarge conjured some freaky black tentacles that were able to shuffle the
			 giant across the chasm, where we shoved the thing (with _a lot_ of force) through the
			 portal and followed it in.
	-We found ourselves on what I at first presumed to be an island. . . until I saw its head and
	 fins.
		-In fact, we stood on vegetation-clad back of an enormous turtle, as several others swam
		 in the water nearby.
		-Well, Lucien wasted little time, and began to hack away at the giant like the tree it was
		 the size of.
		-All of us joined in on that, though after some conjured flame and bow, I, with Grimble
		 strapped to me, dove into some turtle-bushes, to get out of sight.
		-That proved quickly prudent, as one of the smaller-but-still enormous turtles emerged from
		 the water, clambering up the back of it's bigger fellow and interposing itself between us
		 and the giant.
		-At that sight, Sarge took a few steps back, saying, "Guys. . . we should try talking this
		 out. . . I think it's a _good_ turtle."
		 "Well," mumbled Bruce, "I do think I might speak it's language. . ."
		 "Yeah! Talk him down from this ledge, Bruce!" I yelled out, from my bush. "Let him know
		  that getting rid of this thing should stop all the portals. He probably hates that! I
		  know I would, in my living room. . ."
		-Bruce, in a burbly, liquid-y language, began to speak to the turtle.
		-And, as it turned out, not a moment too soon, as I felt myself lose my control of the
		 giant's mind. It felt like the turtle had. . . intervened, somehow.
		-Bruce did, though, seem to get through to the beast. It nodded to him, than pushed itself
		 backward with its fins, back into the water.
		-The now-stirring giant was then immediately subjected more attacks from the party.
		-A hail of conjured rocks from Sarge saw particular succes, and he called out that, "It's
		  vulnerable to the element of Earth!"
		-"Alright, then," I whispered to Grimble. "On my signal. . . One. . . Two. . ."
		-I then popped up from the bushes, loosing several arrows at the giant, striking it twice
		 in the chest.
		-Grimble followed that by, from my chest, tossing a thimble-sized green vial. One that grew
		 as it flew forth from his hand and struck the giant, splattering all over it.
		-The giant sizzled, popped, and. . .dissolved into lightning.
			-A neat trick. . . if it weren't for the fact that I'm pretty sure he's dead now.
		-That lightening, though, dispersed into the turtle beneath us, and the water around it, and
		 the turtle began to shudder.
		-"You're welcome!" I called out, to the other turtle, and then scurried over to Jade, saying,
		 "Lets get the fuck out of here.
		-She complied and, after joining hands with all of us, she snapped the weird device The
		 Chosen had given us. Suddenly. . .
	-We were on The Material once more.
		-The Chosen of Mystra stood before us and, undisturbed by our sudden appearance, she said,
		 "You've succceeded, I see. You have my thanks."
		-Indeed, through the doorway, what once was chaotic swirls and a snow dusted rocky slope was
		 now, well, still a chaotic glowing river of. . . something, but different than it was a short
		 while ago!
		-"So," The Chosen continued, "We should then see to your rewards. . ."
		-As promised, she gave Lucien and I each a book, entitled the Tome of Experience.
			-I frowned a bit, but placed it in my pack. I am my best asset after all, so I suppose
			 I can stomach a self-help book.
		-To Sarge, she handed a staff made of brass and a bronze-colored wood, after a wave of her
		 hand summoned or called it into being.
			-That evidently delighted him.
		-And, to Jade, she similarly called for a beautiful piece of crystal, saying, "This should
		  suit your purposes. I shall also give you the time you need with the stream. Go, child,
		  and do your working."
			-Jade made some preparations, taking a seat beside the stream and drawing circles and
			 diagrams around herself with various magical reagents.
			-Then, slowly, she dipped one corner of the crystal into the stream. . . and went still.
			-We waited moments. . . then minutes, and still she did not withdraw the crystal from
			 the stream or otherwise move.
			-After a fair while of growing more agitated by the moment, Bruce approached and tried
			 to reach for the crystal. . . only to also go still when _he_ touched it.
			-Well, the rest of us looked at each other. . . but then sat down to wait a while
			 without attempting further interventions.
			-After what had to have been a couple of hours, Jade and Bruce both stirred.
			-Jade, in particular, looked somewhat shaken, but also reported success. She also said
			 she thought it will be a bit healthier than the other too. . .

TODO:
	-(DONE) Get that Eternal Wand of Undersong. See below for more details.

2/21/24:
	-Reality untangled, we made our way back out of the mines and to the dwarven city.
	-A 10 ft. tall bull-man proved easy to find in a city of dwarves, especially since they were at
	 my first stop, the bar I left my party-goers at.
		-(I wasn't even looking for them yet. Just wanted a drink. . .)
		-Greeting them, Jade inquired how Maya and D'Roc's hob-nobbing went.
		-Sounds like they met with success, and came back with some potential work.
			-Apparently there's some issues with bandits, and Maya came up with some plan to settle
			 them on some empty land to resolve the issue. The king was amenable and she got the job
			 of talking them into it, and getting them to a meeting about it.
			 "Sell them on it being more fun to hang with Fred than getting impaled?" I asked. "Seems
			  pretty easy."
		-Jade had also apparently had a dream recently, concerning some of Nikisi's followers in The
		 Morticians Guild.
			-She thought it meant they were still around, and wanted to go haring off after them.
			-Weirdly, Lucien was backing her on this, acting like he was _there_, in her dream. . .
				-Well, I've heard, seen, and done crazier. . .
			-Not sure I want anything further to do with followers of The Brotherhood, but I also
			 guess we'd probably be killing those corpsefuckers.
		-We debated the subject briefly, but Lucien took the. . . higher? wetter? ground, and poured
		 out two shots of his Abyssal liquor.
			-He passed one to D'Roc, saying, "I don't believe you've tried this yet. . ."
			-I never knew D'Roc to lack bravery (though I've also never much loved Wisdom), yet he
			 seemed reluctant to try the strange liquor, having seen it's effect on the rest of us,
			 resisting even as I began to chant, "Drink! Drink! Drink!"
			-Lucien shrugged, and then downed both shots, leading to much raving on Lucien's part.
				-Jade even pointed out that he seemed to suffer from some sinister spell effect,
				 though there was some disagreement about exactly what amount the arcanely inclined.
				-They bandied about sinister terms like "Power Word" or "Phantasmal Killer".
				-Whatever it was, it gave Lucien a hell of a nosebleed.
		-As Lucien came back around, we coalesced on the bandit task.
		-I felt no need to _hurry_ out into the wilderness, and said as much, suggesting we order a
		 round and some food, then make plans.
			-In particular, I suggested we talk about what supplies we need to stock up on.
			-On the walk back to the city, Jade and I had discussed options for helping me focus a
			 bit better, especially after I almost lost my grip on that lighting elemental/giant's
			 mind. She had actually had a great suggestion, some spell for the rythmically-inclined
			 which she could create a wand of for me, and even extend the wand's duration as she'd
			 been doing with other spells already. I was sold, and wanted to pick up the materials
			 for it.
	-Dinner(? Hard to tell when undergound. . .) done with, we did our shopping, then headed back
	 to the ship, chivvying some of my stray followers aboard as we ran into them.
		-Once back to the ship, I sent some of the followers on hand to round up the rest, and put
		 the others already there to loading the ship.
		-Soon, we were aloft.
	-The ship traveled through the night and, the next day, we were soon in the area we'd been told
	 the bandits were operating.
		-Jade, with some help from her magic crystal, was able to create that Undersong wand for me
		 while we traveled.
		-I suggested that, to find the bandits, we engage in some aerial reconnaissance (in no small
		 part because I got to sit aboard my comfortable ship while we did so).
		-The party all assented, and Lucien and Bruce climbed the mast to keep lookout in the crow's
		 nest.
		-A little while later, some commotion came from the top of the mast, with Bruce and Lucien
		 yelling.
		-I looked up just in time to see a bolt of lightening strike the mast.
		-Looking in the direction it came from, I saw a huge winged lizard and, casting my eyes
		 about, I spotted another nearby.
		-Grimble dived behind a gunwale and began casting a spell on himself while one of the winged
		 lizards swooped at the crows nest, attempting to claw at Lucien as Lucien ducked.
		-Battle was joined and, as the lizards swooped again and again at Lucien (he seemed to be
		 taking pains to draw attention to himself) while our party hurled spells back at them.
		-I focused on one of them and froze it's brain. It's outstretched wings kept it at a gentle
		 glide but it rapidly fell behind our speeding ship.
		-Meanwhile, D'Roc rushed to the front of the ship and brought one of our loaded cannons to
		 bear on the remaining lizards, shooting it out of the sky.
		-That left the brain locked lizard, which soon shook the effect off as the ship pulled me
		 out of the range of my power, after which it began flapping after us.
		-It was somewhat faster than the ship and was slowly closing the distance, so the whole
		 party joined me at the back of the ship, readying attacks for when it got back in range.
		-Noteably, D'Roc dragged the two remaining loaded cannons over, with seeming ease, which
		 he and Lucien quickly made good use of as the winged thing neared.
		-That was joined by a variety of spells and other projectiles.
		-Sarge flew forward, to get the thing in range of a spell, but that proved a pit unwise
		 when the thing swooped forward and grabbed Sarge with it's claws.
		-Maya took wing too, flying closer to the beast, and shot it straight in the face,
		 vaporizing its head with eldritch energy.
		-Sarge was then able to quickly free himself from the now limp claws, and I slowed the ship
		 while he and Maya flapped back over.
	-Some healing and reloading followed.
		-Lucien asked if we were ready to continue on or if we should rest, to which I replied, "I'm
		 ready for a toast! To our victory!" Lucien obligingly poured out some whiskey shots.
		-The warming whiskey was well welcome, as the sun had to dropped nearly to the horizon, the
		 temperature dropping with it.
		-The twilight was very welcome too, though, as it was essentially the perfect time to search
		 for bandits.
	-Before the sun had set, Lucien called out from the crows nest, saying, "A caravan! And it's in
	  trouble. . ."
		-Climbing down, he pointed out the caravan. . . and it's pursuers. "They're rather large. . ."
		 he added.
		-I changed the ship's heading and soon we were hovering above the caravan, perhaps 15 or 20
		 feet up.
		-Lucien wasted no time jumping down to the ground, landing with a graceful roll, and was
		 followed shortly by D'Roc, landing with a thud.
		-In response the bandits, now clearly _ogre_ bandits, took off running.
		-Lucien growled at them to halt, and they did, while Maya flew down and started talking to
		 them.
		-She asked them questions about how many of them there were, and eventually arranged to
		 meet with their leader, back at the cave in which their tribe of bandits resided.
		-The caravan, meanwhile, was guarded by a party of more junior adventurers.
			-We accepted their thanks, and Maya offered them the blessings of of Bahamut, a thing
			 that delighted all of them, save one dressed in black who grumbled in response.
			-Lucien offered one, a ranger, a swig of the Abyssal Temptation, which he took like a
			 champ.
			-(They're all level two, except the ranger, who leveled up from bravely facing The
			  Abyss.)
	-I instructed my followers to, after we left, bring the ship up higher until they caught sight
	 of us again, and admonished them to listen to Rusty. The rest of us, then, descended via ropes
	 and various other means, and followed the ogres back to their cave.
		-They led us back to a filthy cavernmouth, and inside.
		-Just inside the entrance, they halted. Looking from one to another, they then turned to us,
		 giggling, of all things, and asked, "Uh, do you like surprises?"
		-That understandably met with a chorus of no's from us, and rather spoiled the surprise when
		 an enormous ball of writhing black ooze dropped down onto us.
		-Sarge's reflexes were quick and he seared it with a blast of flame from his hands as it
		 fell, but fell it still did, right on Lucien.
		-That was like spitting a loogie into a blender, though, Lucien with his sword and all, and
		 we were all sprayed by bits of it. . . annoyingly damaging a lot of our equipment with the
		 acidic slime.
		-Lucien continued on, slaying one of the ogres too.
		-I called out to the remaining one, "Here's a surprise: I'd be surprised if you live through
		  this. Better cut this surprise shit _really_ fast. . ."
		-He cowered, in response, and Lucien demanded, "Now, who was your leader?"
		-Maya then stepped forward and chimed in, "My friends here _do not_ like surprises. Take us
		  to your leader without any more of them. . ."
		 "Bu. . . But, he said people _love_ survivors. . ." the ogre blubbered, as he turned and
		 walked off down the tunnel.
	-The remaining ogre led us a ways through the caves without further incident, and eventually to
	 a chamber bedecked in carved stone and featuring a man in dark furs, a statue behind him, and
	 a floor carpeted in a mix of treasure and bones.
		-"Did you get the caravan?" he began in response to the ogre's thudding footfalls. "It
		  should ha. . ."
		-As he trailed off at the sight of us behind the ogre, the ogre gestured to him, saying,
		 "This Ravenshroud. He good leader. . ."
		 ". . . What in the hells do you want?" Ravenshroud then said, addressing us. "I see I now
		  seem to be short an ogre. . ."
		-Maya launched into her spiel, saying she came with an offer from the king of Sharaar Kol,
		 an offer of peace, land, and alliance, if he would stop his depredations.
		-He nodded along, saying "Uh huh, I would be willing. . ."
		-I, though, detected a note in his voice. He sounded concerned and evasive, like he was
		 getting ready to bolt.
		-Indeed, following his arm down, I saw him reaching for a lever alongside his statue. . .
		-Acting quickly to forestall. . . whatever he was doing, I unleashed a blast of psionic
		 energy, stunning the bandit leader. . . along with most of my party, and the ogre.
		-D'Roc, though, was behind me, and outside the effect of the blast, while Lucien also
		 seemed to resist it.
		-I had both of them quickly help me, to drag Ravenshroud away from his lever, to snap off
		 the lever, and to pull Maya out from the space between the bandit and his ogre.
		-After only a few moments, the stunned folks began stirring.
		-Ravenshroud came to with Lucien and D'Roc standing over him. As the bandit unsteadily
		 clambered to his feet, Lucien growled, "That could have gone a lot worse. . ."
		 "Yeah," I added, "We could just as easily have slit your throat while you were on the
		  ground. . . Try listening this time. . . or we'll try that."
		-Clearly, he got the message, and he was much more receptive to _Maya's_ message.
			-She soon had him agreeing to meet with the king, and had even offered him a ride back
			 to Sharaar Kol with us, aboard our luxurious airship.
			-She _did_ note, though, that his ill-gotten plunder might need to be confiscated, a
			 thing the rest of us enthusiastically set about doing as she led him off down the
			 tunnel, towards the cave's entrance.


TODO:
	-(Done!) Make sure party is OK with how loot is alotted and sold. See spreadsheet.
	-(Done!) Subtract replacement cost of acid damaged stuff, roughly 600 for a high estimate.


3/6/24:
	-I spent the flight back to Sharaar Kol drinking with Lucien, D'Roc, and the bandit leader.
		-We all pushed the idea of taking the king's deal pretty hard.
			-"You can go legit!" I suggested. "Now, you 'confiscate' 'taxes' from caravans!"
		-He sampled some of Lucien's Abyssal liquor, followed by Lucien himself, and they both
		 began babbling about the contents of their shoulders.
			-Interestingly, they fell to discussing some past deal of the bandit's, mentioning a
			 drow named "Raith", who had set him up in his current deal, inducing him to attack
			 caravans in the area, and providing weapons and goons with which to do so.
			-It suggests there's another power in play here, and one that might work against our
			 bandit's change of heart and Sharaar Kol's interests.
			-"Well," I told the bandit, "Sounds like the dwarf king's got another problem, and us
			  an opportunity, problem solvers that we are."
		-We also explained to him that Maya is big in Sasserine. Being on her good side could mean
		 some backing from another power.
	-Once back at Sharaar Kol, Maya offered to take the bandit king to an inn to freshen up, and to
	 go find some nicer clothes for his meeting with the dwarven king.
		-So, we started talking about shopping!
		-Jade chimed in that she might have a way to fund some of that shopping: salt.
			-Apparently, she can conjure the stuff, and asked for our help selling it in bulk, here
			 and maybe other ports of call.
				-She demonstrated this talent by first conjuring some huge rock bins in the ship's
				 hold and then conjuring the salt itself, inside the bins and in vast quantity.
				-Supposedly, she said, 10's of _thousands_ of gold worth.
			-Interesting possibilities, here!
				-"Our problem, then," I said, "Is one of demand, not supply. But, we've got our ship,
				  and already visit plenty of ports of call. . ."
				-Maya even volunteered that one of the other noble families in Sasserine run the
				 city's fishing industry. . .
			-So, we got to selling, clearing 2700 gp. with a single bulk sale.
		-We then set about unloading our confiscated-from-the-bandits loot and replacing our acid
		 damaged stuff.
			-Maya bought some _elaborate_ clothes for herself, Jade, Sarge, and D'Roc.
	-Shopping handled, we then went to see the king, bringing the bandit along.
		-The bandit leader, hesitent and seemingly shy before the dwarf king, related the tale of
		 this drow Raith. Maya eventually had to help him along, offering some of the details
		 herself.
		-The king had little respect for the suddenly shy bandit, provoking him rather badly, but
		 the bandit remained meek and agreed to the king's terms.
			-In particular, given the revelation about this drown backer, the dwarf king doubted
			 (aloud) that the (former) bandit could really hold this land.
		-We, in turn, were paid a princely sum, 4,000 gp., for delivering and convincing the man.
		-We were also offered a new task: bringing to the king this drow.
			-After the way the last task paid, we were happy to accept.
	-When we were dismissed from the king's presence, we set about discussing our drow hunt, and
	 the supplies we'd need.
		-The now-former bandit interjected, "Well, you guys _broke_ the lever to The Underdark. . ."
		-That got us all staring at him, and he went on to explain that the lever had been the
		 start of the long, twisting path through The Underdark that he had been following to meet
		 his drow contact.
			-"I think it was such a long mess just because he liked torturing me. . ." he added.
			-This was so helpful we bothered to ask his name: Gevin.


TODO:
	-(DONE) Commission something from Jade, now that you've got tons of money. Maybe the Stone of Good Luck?
		-Talked about it in Discord here: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1027415547278794782/1215139511726645278
		-So, with just paid-for crafting time, through the magic crystal and Lesser Restoration,
		 it costs:
			-Wand charges: 20/50*562.5 = 225 gp. and 20/50*60 = 24 XP
			-Stone: 10k*.75 = 7.5k and 20k/25 = 800 XP
			-For a total of: 7,725 gp. and 824 XP
		-Worth the XP? Probably. . .
	-(VEST DONE) Maybe a vest or ring as well (or possibly even instead)?
		http://mcdt2-dungeon.wikidot.com/item:vest-of-resistance
		https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ring_of_Protection
	-Jade craft formula:
		Gold: COST_IN_GP/2*.75
		XP: COST_IN_GP/25
		Time: Floor(COST_IN_GP/1000)
				or
			  WAND_CHARGES_IN_GP = Floor(COST_IN_GP/1000)*1500/50
			  Crafting cost: WAND_CHARGES_IN_GP/2*.75 gp., WAND_CHARGES_IN_GP/25 in XP
				Lessor Restoration as a 1st lvl. paladin wand is 1500
				The crystal can provide 1 day worth of time per charge, as it removes Fatigued
				(or turns Exhausted to Fatigued) and the crystal does:
					"First 10 minutes = Fatigued, then Exhausted after another 10"
	-So a Vest of Resistance +3:
		9000/2*.75 = 3375 gp., 9000/25 = 360 XP
		Wand charges = 9000/1000 = 9
			WAND_CHARGES_IN_GP = 9*1500/50 = 270 gp.
			Crafting cost: 270/2*.75 = 101.25 gp. ; 270/25 = 10.8


3/20/24:
	-The drow hunting discussion continued, and we quickly addressed the light aspect: Maya has
	 a dozen or so sunrods that we'll tie to D'Roc's horn as needed (most of us can see in the dark
	 anyways).
	-Far _less_ quickly, though, we discussed Jade's wonderous enchanting talents, kicked off by my
	 bringing up a luck rock I want.
		-She was amenable, having that magic crystal now, and she even offered to cover the magical
		 energies if I would purchase the materials.
		-That inspired a flurry of further requests, from the others and even another for me: a
		 shiny magic vest!
		-She was frantically noting down the details of our shouted-over-each-other commissions,
		 looking a bit harried, while Bruce hovered (not, in this case, literally) at her side,
		 looking a bit worried.
		-She paused then, suddenly and, looking up, said, ". . . How old will I be after this?"
		-We looked at her quizically and she elaborated. "This. . . accelerated time. . . it has
		  real, physical impacts on the world. Even with the fatigue handled by other magic, I
		  think I'm at least growing older by the days it grants me. . ."
		 ". . . Huh," I replied. "Well. . . you were going to build all this stuff anyways, right?
		  It's basically a wash for you! It's just better for us! Faster!"
		 "Uh. . ."
		-That sparked lots of conversation.
			-Bruce was asking her if, "young lady", she really thought this was worth it.
			-She, meanwhile and looking to the rest of us, sounded almost be pleading, "If we do
			  this. . . We'll find a way to fix this, right?"
			-I felt her exactly. "Sure! We'll just figure out how to make ourselves immortal!"
			-Then, after a pause, I added, "If you've got something for that. . . get working,
			 Jade."
			 "Uh. . ."
			-Since she was starting to seem a bit reluctant with all this, I offered something a
			 bit more concrete.
				-"Look," I said, "If it comes to it, I now a way you can become immortal. It's not
				  the _best_ option, but, if we can't find something better, it's there."
				 "Uh. . . how?" she asked.
				 "I _promise_. Isn't that good enough?"
				 ". . . No."
				 ". . . OK. Fine," I said, giving in. "It's the big thing where I come from. . .
				  People turning into these. .  . Elans, they call themselves. Then, they live
				  forever!"
				 "Where. . . What is. . ."
				 "It's tied to Edric, the god that made me."
				 ". . . Why haven't you done it?"
				 "Can't. The bastard. . ."
				 "Why not?"
				 "It's. . . You know how I can kill you with my brain?" I said. "It's got something
				  to do with that. Ed tried it with. . . someone he knew, way back. . . . I think
				  I'm actually related to the guy. He was like me, anyways, and, after the
				  process. . . Well, what's left of him is some kind of. . . mold? It covers miles
				  and miles. . . but is definitely not how I want to end up."
			-The conversation awkwardly petered out after that. . . but she agreed to all the
			 crafting.
	-That settled, we did various bits of shopping.
		-There were the enchanting materials, of course.
		-Maya also wanted to get some make up, "To make her look like a drow."
			-This was. . . questionable.
			-But, I wasn't going to stop her! In fact, "Sure, Maya! Let's go shopping! We'll bring
			 Grimble! He's in the _entertainment_ industry!"
			-And we did exactly that, with Maya spending 50 gold on the various cosmetics she,
			 Grimble, and I pointed at in the shop we visited.
		-From there, Maya also wanted to visit the high priest of Moradin, the one we'd saved from
		 that vile kidnapper. . . Nkondi.
			-After all, she pointed out that a dwarven priest is likely well able to help guard us
			 against those perfidious drow and the nefarious poisons.
			-Her name was plenty to get _her_ taken back to see the priest, a thing I made no real
			 attempt to shoehorn my way into, I not being in the mood to be preached at.
			-Instead, when she collected us in the nearby square, reporting that the priest had
			 promised her that he'd have an assortment of potions available for us inside of an
			 hour or two, I suggested we find a tavern in which to wait.
		-We then found a nearby bar, labeled the The Endless Bar and built into a disused mineshaft
		 with the other end of the space ending in a collapsed tunnel.
			-The barkeep greeted us and I ordered an ale.
			-He also offered some welcome food, a chicken and mushroom soup or the chef's special,
			 a roast mole.
				-"Well, you caught my ears with the mushroom, figure a dwarf would know good
			      mushrooms," I said. "But dwarves would know _moles_ too! I'll have the special!"
				-Sarge added that he'd have, "What the captain's having." Soon, the barkeep was
				 calling me captain too.
				 "Always good to see a tavern that's in ship-shape!" I graciously riffed.
		-A few hours turned into three or four and then the raucous bunch of us went to go pick up
		 the potions at the temple, with Maya taking possession of them.
	-All that in hand, we grabbed our bandit king from the dwarf king's residence and headed for
	 the ship.
		-Between our previous visit and the bandit's landmarks, it was no trouble to find our way
		 back to his cave and, descending, we were soon back in his. . . audience chamber.
		-Jade examined the broken lever and, with a moment's fiddling, was able to trigger it's
		 connected mechanism, sliding away a counterweighted stone wall and opening a passageway.
		-We then discussed directions with the bandit.
			-He said the dark elf changed the location he held the meetings regularly, but all were
			 reached at the end of a long, winding series of caverns.
			-In particular, he also mentioned an old, ruined temple, in which grew glowing green
			 mushrooms, where he had held their most important meetings.
			-We seized on that and got detailed directions to it. Between that and several of our
			 group being skilled trackers, we figured we had it covered.
	-Following the bandit's directions, we wound through caves for what felt like many hours, though
	 time was quite hard to guage down here.
	-Eventually, though, we reached a cave where, as it opened up a bit and we walked forward, dark,
	 many-legged shapes skittered back from the light strapped to D'Roc's horn.
		-"Uh oh," I said. "I can see where this is going. . . Or, well, hang on. . . _Now_ I can,"
		 I continued, as I manifested Defensive Precognition.
		-"Fred. . ." Jade then called out.
		 "Huh?"
		 "When you did that. . Those glowing mushrooms over there started. . . waving, and changing
		  colors. . ."
			-Well that's not good either.
	
	
TODO:
	-I manifested Defensive Precognition at the first sight of the spiders, and have added it's +3
	 to my Misc AC and my saves. Remove that when done.
		-Ah, and Grimble has Mage Armor applied too, but improperly.
			-Removed that. . .


3/25/24:
	-Lucien began to creep forward, slowly, towards where the spider-y things skittered off to while
	 I turned to Grimble and whispered, "Might be time for your magic armor. . ."
		-He nodded in response and began casting.
		-Noteably, the mushrooms _also_ reacted to that, shifting to a different color than with my
		 power.
	-I then slunk off towards a likely looking niche in which to hide.
		-A bit _too_ likely, as it turned out. Bruce and Lucien began to shout something to me as
		 the rock wall before me dissolved in a spray of acid.
		-I was able to hop back and dodge the spray of acid, but not the immense paw of. . .
		 something, that reached out a grabbed me.
	-From there, I had my hands quite full with. . . whatever had it's hands full of me.
		-It couldn't escape my notice, though, when something metallic struck the stone around the
		 corner from me _very_ loudly.
		-It took me a moment more to see Lucien's blade embedded in the. . . thing that had grabbed
		 me, he having cleaved through the rock face separating him from it.
		-But then it dragged me beneath the earth, tunneling through the rock, and I lost track of
		 most of what was going on.
		-Instead, I focused on battering away at the beast. . . with my brain.
		-It's mind proved durable and my first attempt, at least, got nowhere.
		-Meanwhile, it was secreting some goop that _burned_. Like crazy.
		-I next tried something a bit more subtle, trying to implant an aversion to me, rather than
		 just hammering away at it's grey matter, but had no better luck.
		-To my confusion, the rock around me then dissolved into mud and fell in gobs around the
		 beast and I.
		-To my delight, that was quickly followed by D'Roc charging over to us and burying his axe
		 in the ugly lump's maybe-a-head protrusion, causing it to go limp.
			-And leaving me distinctly filthy, covered now in mud, that creature's secretions, and
			 whatever passes for it's blood. But, alive!
		-Before I could so much as find cover, the sounds of battle died down, and I looked up from
		 my filthy melt-wounds to see Lucien standing over a spider corpse, and a number of other
		 spider corpses and party members scattered about.
	-Grimble and I took turns healing my acid burns with our magic belts, then joined the others in
	 rummaging around.
		-Apparently, as they filled me in, some kind of druid had been controlling at least the
		 spiders.
		-They were already rifling through his pockets when I walked up, turning up a magic ring
		 and a carved bone sceptor.
			-The latter looked reasonably valuable, but I lost most interest once Jade said it
			 wasn't magical.
			-Jade and Maya continued to pour over it, though, talking about the symbols carved into
			 it.
				-Bruce mentioned they were tied to some kind of place of earth and evil, known as
				 "Earth's End", found somewhere in The Underdark.


4/3/24:
	-Well, that druid is mostly blood-colored now, but he sure doesn't look like a drow.
		-Maybe an orc, looking at him.
		-In any event, he didn't seem to be our target.
	-But, first, we did take a moment to further examine our surroundings. . . and the late druid's
	 possessions.
		-It had sunk in for me that Bruce had mentioned some connection _to the element of earth_,
		 so, with mixed feelings, I asked him about it, saying, "So. . . you said something about
		  an 'Earth's End'? That where this druid was from?"
			-That kicked off further discussion of the subject, from which I gleaned a few things:
				-Earth's End is something of a trading post, located in The Underdark.
				-There is a portal there, connected to The Elemental Plane of Earth.
				-The glyphs on that carved bone sceptor described a path to the place, glyphs that
				 Bruce could decipher and which gave landmarks D'Roc was confident he'd be able to
				 find.
			-So, we could find the place if we wanted. But, I raised the question of _should_ we.
				-"Is this where we're going to try and find the drow? That abandoned temple or what
				  not?" I asked.
				-D'Roc and Bruce both conferred, and also looked over a nearby ledge, down into a
				 darkened cavern ahead of us.
				-They claimed they could see, below, a field of large glowing crystals, one of the
				 landmarks on _both_ routes, but said that, from there, the paths diverge.
				-"Well," I said, "The abandoned temple, where this drow was hosting meetings, that's
				  our goal here. What do you say we check the place out and, if that trail is cold,
				  hit up this trading post next, and ask around? How about it?"
				-That met with a chorus of nods, so that's what we resolved to do.
		-I also then brought up the glowing fungus, saying, "Anyone interested in those mushrooms
 		 over there? The ones that lit up in response to magic and my brain powers?"
			-That, though, found no takers, and I certainly wasn't going to touch the things myself.
	-With us having resolved to continue on to the abandoned temple, we set about looking for a way
     down to the floor of the cavern over the ledge, the one with the crystals we could see far below
	 us, glowing.
		-We discussed various options for getting down what proved to be a 200' sheer descent.
			-Several people could fly, and we had various things we could cast, but getting everyone
			 down with magic would certainly impose some degree of cost.
			-"How do you think our kinda-shit bandit was getting down there?" I asked. "He seemed
			  like the lazy sort. . . think there's some kind of path somewhere?"
		-That prompted a search, which eventually turned up a secret door, some rock that could be
		 pushed inward like a door revealing a kind of hand-cranked elevator.
			-"Could be trapped. . ." I warned, ". . . Buuuttt, looks fine to me! Who wants to go
			  first?"
			-Jade, though, pointed out a trick to the operation of it's mechanism, one that required
			 it's crank to first be turned a half turn the _wrong_ way, before beginning to crank
			 the elevator, lest it trigger. . . something. Doubtlessly some nefarious consequence.
			-_After_ that, Lucien volunteered to go first. Sarge, Bruce, and Maya all flew down,
			 while Jade _lept over the edge_. . . only to gently float down, pointing to a ring on
			 her finger.
			-I crammed Grimble and myself into the elevator after Lucien's trip, and then D'Roc
			 followed us down after.
	-As Grimble and I emerged from the elevator, I saw Maya, who flew down, already conferring with
	 some kind of floating masses of tentacles, before the passage that led deeper into the glowing
	 crystals.
		-It actually seemed rather friendly, and spoke Common. It wanted to sell us it's polished
		 rocks and mushrooms.
		-Naturally, Maya was interested, and bought several of each, delighting the weird little
		 critters, and offered them some cupcakes, gratis.
		-They'd set up shop in front of of a bunch of big, glowing crystals, shedding a bright-as-
		 day light in the surrounding area.
		-We fell to discussing the area with the critters. They mentioned several things of interest:
			-We were nicer than the last one of our sort who came through, who further questioning
			 proved to have been our bandit.
			-After some prompting from us, they also said they were familiar with someone who sounded
			 like our drow.
				-They said he avoided their place of light, but that they'd seen him passing by.
				-Further, they'd always seen him in the company of his sister.
			-I asked them about the neighborhood and they said it was great, on account of the magic
			 light keeping the drow away, and on account of the regular traffic.
			-"Oh? Who all else comes through here?" I asked.
			 "Well, there's the. . . whatchou call it. . . big lizard thing?" one of them offered. "It
			  does something with it's eyes. . . Well, not to our kind. . . It's where we got these
			  rocks!"
			 "A basilisk?!?" Lucien growled. "Do you mean _a basilisk_?"
			 "Yes! That's the word!" the floater replied.
			 ". . . When did you last see it?" Lucien asked.
			 "Oh! Just a few moments ago, actually. . ."
	-That revelation kicked off quite the flurry of activity, with people variously throwing their
	 hands over their eyes or (unwisely) casting their eyes about, looking for the creature.
		-As I guess having seen that makes clear, I did the latter, before hurridly switching to
		 the former.
		-Not a moment too soon, either, it sounded like, as I soon heard a hissing noise, coming from
		 the direction I thought the glowing crystals were.
		-I began stumbling off in the opposite direction, looking for something to hide behind,
		 nearly tripping over Grimble in the process.
		-Finding my a suitable feeling lump of rock, I ducked behind it and began to activate my
		 precognition.
			-As I did so, I could hear a loud hum begin, coming from the direction of the crystals. . .
			-When the power took effect, it. . . was never like this before. I could catch _intense_
			 glimpses of many possible near-futures, the effect stronger than ever.
			-But, I _also_ felt the flash of memory, scenes of my home plane that were decidedly
			 unwelcome. I couldn't tell if something simply reminded me of home. . . or if something
			 more was going on in this suspiciously crystal-studded cavern.
		-Meanwhile, the sounds of battle had begun, behind the rock I leaned against.
		-As my attention returned (mostly) to the present, I called out, "Grimble! Help us out here:
		 we could use a distraction.
		-He grunted in response, and then began to chant arcane syllables. Stopping the chant, he
		 then began to scream with what sounded like (feigned?) fear, yelling, "Ahhh!!! I don't think
		  basilisks speak common! Ahhh!!! I'm making the ceiling appear to cave in! _Don't_ run for
		  your lives!"
			-Catching on, I chimed in, shouting, "Oh no! A rock _isn't_ crushing my leg! Aghhhh!"
			-It was quite the illusion! I could swear I even thought I felt small bits of rock fall
			 onto me, like the cave really _was_ crumbling a bit. . .
		-The sounds of battle died down at the same time, though I still dared not look over to see
		 exactly why.
		-Grimble, though, spoke up a moment later, saying, "Uh, Fred?"
		 "Yeah?"
		 "Time to open your eyes. . . and to start running."
		-Opening them, I could see the crystals had begun to glow still brighter, and in fact were
		 growing steadily brighter and pulsing erratically.
		-I did indeed start to run, diving around a corner to get a fair few feet of rock between
		 me and the crystals, just before the brightness reached a searing crescendo that left me,
		 even shadowed by the rock, very briefly blind.
		-As my vision cleared a second or two later, I could see Grimble, lying at my feet and
		 having not quite reached the shelter I had, turned. . . to crystal?
	-I fell to my knees and tried to shake what indeed proved to be something like a crystal copy
	 of my companion, calling his name.
		-"What happened. . ." someone behind me asked.
		-Jade then rushed forward, kneeling beside Grimble too, saying, "He's. . . been transformed.
		  I. . . don't think he's alive. . ."
		-That prompted a bit of shouting from me.
		-Eventually, though, I realized Jade was continuing to mumble, saying, ". . .and there's. . .
		  something here. . .  a connection. . ."
		-She touched Grimble's glassy form and something. . . emerged. . . from it, a forked black
		 crystal that floated up from his chest, and then hovered above him.
		-"Oh!" Jade exclaimed, as I began to shout at nearly the same time, "Oh no!"
		-Not heeding the warning I barely had begun to get out, Jade reached out and grabbed the
		 key and, after gazing on it only a moment, pulled that hells-damned orb of hers from her
		 pack and began attempting to slot the key into it.
		-"Of _course_ this was him!" I shouted. "That bastard! He can go fuck himself with his own
		  crystal cock!"
		 "Him?" Jade asked, not slowing her attempts to find the slot for the key. "Who do you mean?"
		 "That's a key to _his_ realm! Edric! The asshole god that made me! He's doing this to get
		  to me. . ."
		 "Oh. So that means. . ." she mumbled, turning the orb, inspecting a symbol, and finding,
		 this time, a slot which the key slid into.
		-At that point, I lost her, as she began to run her hands over the orb, inspecting various
		 parts of it, and mumbling to herself.
		-D'Roc, though, asked me, "Fred, why do you hate the god that made you?"
		 "Well, he's a dick," I began. "But, more importantly. . . Well, look, I know you _think_
		  I'm perfect. But. . . Well, I don't want to say I'm exactly _imperfect_. . . You know how
		  I can kill stuff with my brain?"
		 He nodded, so I continued, saying, "_He_ made me like that. And, well, it's cool and all. . .
		  _Really_ cool. But, if I wasn't like this? I'd be immortal! Live forever! He denied me
		  that!"
		-I'm not sure he really comprehended the magnitude of the crime committed against me, and
		 there were certainly other vile acts committed by Edric I didn't have the time to get into,
		 but he humored me with a nod.
	-At this point, I noticed Maya had been quiet for a while (which is quite unusual). Turning from
	 Grimble, and casting my eyes about, I saw her standing motionless, off to one side a short
	 distance away.
		-She was. . . quite the sight.
			-She was standing in an immaculate gown. Not what she'd had on earlier, and too clean
			 in any case to have been worn for our trek through The Underdark.
			-Her skin, though, where ever it wasn't covered by the gown. . . was _covered_ in blood.
			 Absolutely drenched.
			-She also held in her arms a shining metallic cloak, as clean as the gown.
		-"Uh, Maya. . ." I began.
		 "I asked my friend to help Grimble," she broke in, beginning herself.
		-Throughout the course of the conversation, it came out that:
			-Maya's not-imaginary-after-all friend is _clearly_ Bahamut.
				-Jade recognized symbols he was appearing to Maya with, something about yellow birds.
				-But, it's also not terribly surprising. "See!" I shouted in response, "You're
				 clearly magic! Shooting energy bursts from your hands is a dead give away. . ."
			-She'd asked him to save Grimble. . .
				-". . . Can he?" I asked, more subdued than my companions had ever seen me.
				 "He cannot bring him back to life. . ." Maya started.
				 "Yeah, figures. . ." I interjected.
				 "Edric has claimed his soul, paying a high price for it. . ."
				 "That crystal dick!"
				 ". . . But this cloak. . ." she continued, "He said it could grant him an appeal?
				  In some kind of court?"
				 "Wait. . ." I said. This having rung a bell for me, I turned to look at Jade and
				 Lucien and said, "Didn't I walk in on the two of you discussing. . . a dream? Of
				  some kind of court with lost souls and such? Is that. . . this?"
				 "It wasn't so much a court as an auction," Jade responded. "Lucien and I served as
				  advocates for some of the souls there, helping them reach suitable destinations."
				 "We did very well at it too!" Lucien added. "We made quite the team, Jade."
				 "Yes. We demonstrated that. . ." Jade continued.
				 "OK, yep, sounds like the thing," I interrupted. "Well, so, Maya, who do we wrap
				  in the cloak? Grimble? His advocate?"
				 "No, no. You have to wrap his _soul_ in the cloak," she clarified.
				 "Oh. Fuck. So. . . in other words we still have to follow him to Edric's realm. . ."
		-At the mention of Edric's realm, Jade perked up, and began strategizing, saying, "Ah. Well,
		  I think I can put together a planeshift scroll or two, and the key will let us get there.
		  We'd have to head back to town for the materials. . . How much cash does everyone have on
		  hand?"
		-Maya preempted that, though, saying, "Fred. This is just what he wants."
		 "Yeah, I know he wants me to come to him. Won't fucking leave me alone. . ."
		 "He wants you to _rush_ to him, emotional and without thinking," she clarified.
		 "Well. . . We can't just _leave_ Grimble in Edric's clutches. He _makes_ things, Maya.
		  Sometimes, he makes things _out of people_! If we don't get to him soon. . .  he might
		  be _changed_. . ."
		 "You can't help him by doing what Edric wants. But, with help. . ." she said. "If we return
		  this drow to the king of Sharaar Kol, he can have his priests pray for aid. If I then go
		  back to Sasserine. . . Grimble was one of the heroes that saved the people! Surely we can
		  rally the people of the city, and it's temples, to our side."
		-I could see some wisdom in that, the support of allies. . . and that I was going to be out
		 voted here.

4/15/24:
	-Jade and D'Roc began talking about how to carry Grimble, settling on D'Roc carrying the ten
	 times greater weight of his now-crystal form.
	-Buying some time, being not yet ready to move on, I asked Jade about the crystals here.
		-"Those crystals did something to my precognition, making it _way_ more powerful than it's
		  ever been. Saving. . . my. . . ass," I said. "Seems like maybe a you thing, Jade?"
		-Jade eyes indeed widened, and she began to babble a bit, mostly to herself.
		-I caught something about "redirecting" and "kinetic energy". Eventually, catching us
		 staring at her blankly, Jade slowed it down for us, explaining, "I could build a. . . way
		 to redirect an attack with sword. . . outward. Make a weapon, for the ship."
		-Well, that sounded good to me, and we talked a bit about how to haul more of this crystal
		 back, more than the crumbled bits of deep crystal we'd already gathered up.
			-Jade though she could manage some magic, but would need supplies and the like, having
			 to run to town and back.
			-I offered the ship's crew, who could certainly wield some picks, but we'd need to 
			 fetch _them_ too, and need to keep them alive down here.
		-Ultimately, we decided to put a pin in this and come back to it.
	-We then finished gathering everything up and went to leave.
		-To especially Maya's delight, our new tentacle-y buddies followed us. They were of the
		 opinion it was safer around us, and trailed along offering advice about which fungus we
		 passed was tasty or shouldn't be touched (though, given their radically different anatomy,
		 I wasn't putting much stock in it).
	-As we walked on, the enormous crystals proved a confusing reflective maze, but, despite some
	 brief uncertainty, D'Roc lead us out of it, and into some more traditionally-walled tunnels.
	-We walked for what seemed miles, eventually following the sound of water to an arch across
	 a crevasse.
		-"You know," I said, "Watering holes and bridges both tend to play host to predators, two
		  legs or four. Or, here, a thousand. . ."
		-The party indeed stopped a bit short, casting our eyes and ears about before continuing.
		-It was Bruce that pointed out that the noise of the water was something falling _into_ it,
		 and pointed out that the stone arch was already crumbling, even without, say, D'Roc on it.
		-We gathered up our various lengths of rope, passing an end of each to Maya, who flew them
		 across the cavern.
			-She tied her ends to a piton she hammered into the rock while I wrapped the others
			 around a handy rock formation.
			-Jade then I crossed the bridge's slippery footing, clinging tightly to the rope we'd
			 strung.
			-Sarge had to go get fancy spreading his wings and leaping out into the chasm, to glide
			 across. . . falling just a bit short of the other end.
				-As he drifted downward, Maya had to leap in to save him, relying on her glowing
				 wings and trying to catch him by the arm.
				-She had him for a brief moment, but his weight proved too much as he slipped 
				 through her fingers.
				-Sarge started to call out curses, and yelled, "There's something in the water!"
				-I rifled through my holstered wands, pulling out one of Summon Monster I. I called
				 a me-sized centipede into being, clinging to the wall below him, and called out,
				 "Sarge! Grab the bug!"
				-He did as instructed, and the creepy thing was able to scurry up the wall with
				 Sarge on his back, just barely reaching the chasm's edge in the seconds before the
				 insect disappeared.
			-Sarge then safe, I turned to Bruce, who had begun pushing rocks into the water.
				-He yelled something about tentacles, and Maya joined him at the chasm's edge. . .
				 throwing some playing cards into the water?
				-Her plan quickly became clear(ish) as two elves appeared in place of the cards. . .
				 and began thrashing in the water.
					-I guess maybe that at least distracted whatever is down there. I just hope
					 those aren't real people. . .
			-Lucien then darted nimbly across the rock bridge, but D'Roc, attempting to follow that
			 act, immediately fell from the slippery bridge.
				-He held tight to the ropes, but they began to snap one by one.
				-Sarge barked some arcane syllables, and called into being. . . yet more tentacles,
				 black ones emerging from the cliff-face.
				-The new tentacles quickly grabbed D'Roc and threw him upwards, back onto the
				 crumbling bridge.
				-He quickly got his feet beneath him, and _ran_ for us, the bridge now collapsing
				 beneath him, reaching us barely in time.
			-"Well, I'd say lets never do that again," I said, "But that _is_ our way back. . ."
	-We traveled on from the bridge, eventually reaching tunnels of _worked_ stone.
		-Maya and Jade examined the stonework and some inscriptions on it. Maya pronounced it an
		 ancient elven dialect, and described mentions of sacrifice and worship.
		-"Sounds like we're here," Jade said.
		-D'Roc also pointed at some nearby fungus, saying, "Someone's been harvesting that. Within
		  the week."
		-He began to search for tracks leading from them, and found a few sets of footprints, one
		 or more _light_ humanoids and some kind of paw prints.
	-We followed the tracks through these ruins, to a stone staircase, where D'Roc drew up short.
		-Looking back at us behind him, he said, "Do you think there are traps?"
		 "Good question!" I replied. "There was the one in the elevator after all. . . I'll keep
		  an eye out!"
		 "So you'll go first, then?" D'Roc asked.
		 "Fuck no!"
		-We _all_ kept a close watch, and moved cautiously, which was a good thing, as Jade pointed
		 out a trip wire.
		-She volunteered to disable it and, gingerly, cut the wire. . . at which point a dart flew
		 from a unnoticed hole in the wall and right into her side.
			-Weirdly, I then caught a flash of Jade falling to the ground, but only a blink later
			 she was standing as she was before, and drawing the dart from her stomach.
			-Casting my eyes about, I saw magic energies fading from about Bruce's hands, presumably
			 the cause of the weirdness, and maybe what saved Jade.
	-Continuing into the ruin, Maya remarked on a strange statue, pronouncing it some lost diety of
	 the drow, a predecessor to Lloth's hold on them.
	-_My_ eyes were instead drawn to some crates nearby, of a decidedly more recent vintage.
		-Rifling through them, they appeared to be more of the stolen goods the bandit had been
		 trafficking in.
		-"Well, in stolen property, two wrongs do make a right," I claimed. "Ours now!"
		-We grabbed from it some assorted jewelry and scrolls, plus a Wand of Fly that will surely
		 prove handy.
	-We paused a moment at a room filled with rusted spikes, some trap long since triggered, in which
	 D'Roc pointed out some alarming _bite_ marks, indenting the iron of the spikes, and recently. . .
	-Following D'Roc a bit further, he halted again.
		-Pointing ahead of him, he called our attention to some faint voices we could hear some
		 distance ahead of us. Voices, the sleeply snuffling of a beast. . .
	-In hushed whispers, we proposed an ambush, killing anyone but our target and, those of us with
	 appropriate magics, attempting to disable the target.
	-"Those of you feeling sneaky, with me," I said, and then began to creep forward with Lucien in
	 tow.
	-Rounding a corner, I saw two drow: a woman in heavy armor and a man, presumably our target.
		-Sleeping at their feet were two vaguely dog-like things, hideous and covered in spikes.
		-I took cover behind some handy crates while Lucien took a position a bit forward of me,
		 using the corner of a wall as cover.
		-I then waved to D'Roc who came thundering in, the rest of the party behind him and blasting
		 in various ways.
		-Meanwhile, peering around the crate, I mucked about in our target's brain, locking it up
		 so long as kept up my psychic "stirring".
		-A melee soon ensued a short distance ahead of me, Lucien, Jade, and D'Roc tangling with the
		 dog-things while the drow fell back, our target launching crossbow bolts and his sister
		 chanting the words of some spell.
		-Lucien cleaved a dog-thing while Sarge caught the other, and our target's sister, in a huge
		 blast of flame. The rocky skin of the beast weathered it, but the drow was left smoking and
		 motionless.
		-Maya aimed her eldritch blasts at our target, but seemed to be shooting to wound, not kill,
		 which should be a longer term solution than my power.
	-Lucien finished the remaining dog-thing, so we crept forward and debated what to do about the
	 target, while I held tight to his brain.
		-Jade eventually offered to take over, claiming she could exercise a somewhat more subtle
		 control.
		-She chanted some Draconic syllables, and then gave me a nod.
		-I let go, leaving us with a suddenly very cooperative elf.
		-"Well," Maya said, "Lets look around and see what we can find before we lead."
		 "Wait!" I broke in. "We can simple _ask_ our new friend here."
		-I was also similarly eager to volunteer his services as a guide back out of here, if we
		 wished to avoid that now-gone bridge.
		-Jade began to request what we discussed of our well and truely captured target.


4/29/24:
	-The enscrolled drow described to us a route back, through several hidden passages and other
	 ingeneous short cuts.
		-We took him at his (compelled) word and followed him to the surface.
		-The dark elf didn't seems to much enjoy the sunny day we emerged into, but the rest of us
		 sure did. . . and he didn't have any choice.
		-Sarge had a handy Wand of Message, and also essentially specialized in signal flares (being
		 some kind of pyromancer and all), so we had soon signaled our location to the ship and
		 got picked up.
		-Our newfound flump friends had followed us all the way to the surface and were happy to
		 join us aboard ship.
			-They were ooh-ing and ah-ing over, well, everything since we left The Underdark.
			-I wisely suggested leashing them to the ship before we got underway, lest a stray wind
			 sweep them off who knows where.
	-All aboard the ship, we headed back to Sharaar Kol.
	-A storm was blowing in, though, and soon the airship was tossing and shuddering in the winds.
		-The crew and I did what we could to keep the ship under control.
		-It was going well, until disaster, and lightning, struck one of the sails which was soon
		 alight.
		-I called out for help, shouting over the wind, "Shit's on fire! Who can conjure some water
		  or the like?"
		 "Do we have any water?" Maya shouted from the doorway to belowdecks.
		 "There's barrels in the hold!" I replied at the top of my lungs.
		-Maya soon returned with a bucket of water, splashing it all around, and was thankfully
		 followed by D'Roc carrying an entire barrel.
		-Maya took wing with the bucket, dousing part of the burning sail and then returning for
		 more water from D'Roc's bucket.
		-Her next load of water spilled uselessly into the air, though, and, D'Roc, in an effort
		 to help, hurled the barrel itself. . . which crashed through the rapidly disintegrating
		 sail.
		-"Cut the sail free!" I shouted. "We can limp back without it!"
		-The crew began to hack away at the sail's riggin and spars, with mixed success until D'Roc
		 joined with his axe, cutting easily through the spars.
		-As the burning sail fell free, I maneuvered the now-damaged ship out of the storm clouds
		 and into calmer air.
	-We had better weather for the remainder of the journey, and enough time to get some rest.
		-Before turning in, Jade made sure to do some careful maintenance on the spell holding the
		 drow in bondage.
		-After her nap, Maya emerged from her cabin with a tiny brass dragon in tow.
			-"Uh, where'd you find that, Maya?" I asked.
			 "He came to me in a dream while I was meditating," she replied.
			 "Shit. I wish more of _my_ dreams came true. . ."
			-Clearly, she's made another not-imaginary friend. Pretty on brand for her.
	-Soon, we were back in Sharaar Kol.
		-We were drawing even more stares than usual, us and our magically multiplying managerie of
		 various creatures, but particularly the drow.
		-Guards rushed to meet us, demanding an explanation.
			-"Relax, guys," I reassured them. "The king had us retrieve this prisoner for him to
			  interrogate. Jade here has him enscrolled."
		-They then offered us an escort to the king, which we happily accepted, and soon we were in
		 the king's audience chamber.
			-The flumps followed us there, ooh-ing and ah-ing over the city.
			-"Yeah, it's a solid place, guys," I said. "The dwarves know their drink!"
			-It was soon established that the flumps had no idea what booze was, and I had a mission.
		-The king was happy to see us returning successfully, and Jade began to ask about where we
		 could secure the prisoner so she could release his mind.
			-"Wait, release his mind?" I asked. "_Why_, Jade? Lets just get the answers we need
			  while he's compelled to answer!"
			-She looked rather uncomfortable at the idea, and proved unwilling, but the king was
			 fine with the matter and I didn't much care so long as we were going to get paid.
			-As such, they led him off to a cell.
		-Once in a cell, Jade released the drow's mind, leading to a sudden grimace on the prisoner's.
		 face, and we began the interrogation.
			-Lucien furnished us with copious threats, and soon we got through to our prisoner.
				-I remained less than convinced this was kinder than mind control. . .
			-The king demanded answers to why the drow was comissioning attacks on caravans in the
			 region and, after a couple of evasions, gave a name, Shadlock, claiming he'd employed
			 the drow in this matter.
			-Maya and Jade clearly recognized the name, as did the king, who was enraged.
			-The king began to call for the death of this Shadlock and the drow both, but Maya
			 counciled mercy, or at least caution, saying that the drow should be retained while
			 pursuing Shadlock, for information and testimony.
			-Maya was able to persuade the king, and the two of them fell to discussing what to do
			 to settle the region, given this Shadlock's plots.
				-The king asked first for Maya's help, and then her father's, but she pled other
				 commitments.
				-He settled on sending a cousin of his, by the wonderfully dwarven name of Lord
				 Alestone, to oversee the matter, and advise the newly minted bandit-turned-lord.
			-Maya also took a moment to introduce the king to our flump-y friends, and asked him to
			 help set them up in the city.
				-They settled on letting them hang around the local miner's school, an institution
				 dwarves apparently begin attending in childhood.
		-Taking our leave of the king, we led the flumps to the school and introduced them to some
		 of the staff there (they were at least as interested in the rocks strewn around).
			-Before daying our goodbyes, though, I insisted they join us for a celebratory drink.
			-We found a tavern and I called out the the barkeep, "These poor critters have never
			  had a proper drink! Help me fix that!"
			 "Sure! What'll they have?"
			 "Well, they sure love mushrooms. . . Got anything with mushrooms in it?"
			-The barkeep described a beer fermented in barrels covered in mushooms and I ordered
			 a round (and soon several more).
			-What we got was something like a cream of mushroom soup, with a bit of boozy bite.
			-Soon, two of the flumps were floating upside down and the third was on his third.
				-One of them brought up a new rock selling scheme: _tasty_ rocks.
				-That lit up Jade's eyes, and she began discussing the salt business with them. She
				 had apparently recruited her sales force.
					-And quite the talented one! They were brimming over with suggestions. We
					 particularly liked the idea of _colorful_ salt, and decided on blue as quite
					 striking.
				-Maya even helped them come up with a catchy jingle: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1234678503945801779
		-Those of of not so lightweight that we float then fell to discussing our plan for rescuing/
		 resurrecting Grimble.
			-We pooled what I and others knew about Edric's realm, with focus on how to get there
			 (and, perhaps more importantly, how to get back).
			-Maya thought Ed might have Grimble on the layer featuring Rovert's . . . remains.
				-Ugh. Not a place I want to visit.
				-Apparently she'd heard rumors of. . . transformations, conducted there.
			-Jade and Maya both pushed the idea of seeking the protection of some other god, to
			 protect us from Edric.
				-I was decidedly leery of that prospect, though came closest to comfort with Maya's
				 framing of it as _commerce_: doing a favor or the like for some god in return for
				 their protection against Edric.
				-The notion of seeking out other members of The Brotherhood came up, but I was
				 almost as deeply against that as just kowtowing to Edric. After all, their his
				 allies, and probably more inclined to help him than us.
				-The fact that gnomes have a god was also brought up and, knowing Grimble's people,
				 that sounded a bit more attractive to me. We resolved to talk with Grimble's kin,
				 back aboard the ship.
			-We also talked a lot about options for getting to Edric's realm.
				-Jade can make Planeshift scrolls, but Grimble would put us over the headcount
				 limit and each casting risks dumping us some random distance away from our target.
					-Maya had apparently heard of an extra-planar _copy_ of Xûl-Jarak, used as a
					 meeting place by The Brotherhood, something we could use to our advantage with
					 planeshift.
						-I actually visited there as a kid, with my creche!
						-It was no bigger than the fortress, and thus hard to get lost in with
						 Planeshift, but was linked to all the planes of The Brotherhood.
						-Maya even claimed that the key to Edric's plane would _also_ let us
						 Planeshift there!
				-There are also portals, famously the one at Xûl-Jarak where I myself arrived on The
				 Material Plane.


TODO:

5/24/24:
	-Sitting in the tavern, one flump upright and two floating upside down, we continued discussing
	 our plan to get Grimble back (and my traumatic childhood).
		-Jade zoned out for a bit, doing a bit of crystal-fueled crafting.
		-We debated a lot of ideas for leverage, with Edric or even other gods.
			-Gods came up a bunch.
				-We might be able to seek the help of Garl Glittergold. Grimble wasn't really a
				 worshipper, but he sure was an excellent _gnome_ nonetheless: a trickster and
				 master of illusions.
				-Sarge reminded us that I'd mentioned a late companion, Isaias, a cleric of Shawn,
				 who may have been a cleric of Enilias disguised.
					-That certainly speaks to some turmoil, now or when this is revealed, in The
					 Brotherhood, and maybe the possibility of seeking alliances there.
					-It was also on my list of "report back" material.
					-Jade chimed in, pointing out that it was on Isaias's body that we found her
					 orb, a thing he'd never mentioned before his death.
			-I spoke more about the kind of things Edric wants, which it's ostensibly my job to
			 find, but also about how what he almost certainly wants from this is me: information
			 about me and my capabilities, and doubtlessly to put me to some kind of test.
		-In service of exploring. . . services (?) from Garl Glittergold, we decided we should talk
		 talk with Grimble's kin about the subject.
			-"Lets go fetch them. They could probably use a stiff drink, after the news about
			  Grimble. . . Who can run there fastest?" I asked.
			-Lucien raised his hand, so I said to him, "Great! I'll race you there! I'll even give
			 you a head start! You take off and I'll follow when I finish this drink. . ."
				-I ordered another, after he left, and before finishing the one I had.
	-After some further discussion of our plans here, we noticed it had been quite a while that
	 Lucien had been gone. . . even if he strolled up to the docks.
		-We called for the check and were getting ready to follow him when he burst into the bar,
		 hand on his sword hilt.
		-Apparently there'd been yet _another_ kidnapping of my friends: my entire crew.
		-Lucien's devil-brother, Sangravos, was apparently waiting for him, and had taken my crew
		 hostage.
		-Apparently he wanted our help ingratiating himself with the king of Sharaar Kol.
			-A mass kidnapping is a funny way to get that. . .
			-I told him as much, claiming that I certainly can't convince the king to trust him 
			 while something like this is between us. I'm not a good liar. . .
				-He had to concede _both_ points.
		-Fortunately, Maya charmed (magically and regularly both, I think) the pants of off him
		 (thankfully not literally).
			-She convinced him that we could _never_ sell the king on such a thing while we were
			 frantically trying to rescue a friend, and now more friends. If he were to release
			 the crew and come back in a day. . .
			-He couldn't resist her and assented. He waved his hand, leading to some stirring in
			 the hold, and then teleported away.
		-Soon, the crew was emerging from below decks, all talking over one another about how a
		 devil tied them up.
	-With the crew restored to us, we took the opportunity to ask Grimble's kin about Garl
	 Glittergold.
		-"Dimble, Bimble, and Timble, what do you guys know about Garl Glittergold?"
		-They seemed to be about as religious as Grimble, and could really only speak about folksy
		 generalities, saying stuff like, "Uh. . . Well, he loves tricks. Oh! And he likes when
		 little gnomes clean their rooms!"
		 "It's alright guys," I told them. "I slept through religion class too. . ."
		 "You had religion classes?" D'Roc asked.
		 "I grew up in a place directly, and rigidly, run by the god who made me! Of course there
		  were religion classes. . ."
		-Timble _did_ volunteer that we could consult with a cleric of Glittergold.
			-Consulting with _him_, and the rest of his resident kin, we determined the location of
			 the gnome burrow nearest to Sharaar Kol, which he assured us would have one.
	-With a trip to visit some gnomes in mind, we went off in search of a shipwright, to fix our
	 burned and severed sail.
		-Forunately, the airdocks was unsurprisingly the place to find one, and we quickly made our
		 way inside such an establishment, Edgar's.
		-We were greeted warmly by it's owner, proprietor, and namesake, who was happy to do the
		 work, but who, upon hearing about our haste, regrettably informed us that he was closing
		 up for the night and that his employees were already off at a tavern.
			-We offered him additional money for speedy work, but he doubted he could convice his
			 workers to return this evening.
		-Maya, though, once more turned on her charm.
			-Just the regular kind, I think, given the less abrupt and more plausible effect it had
			 on him.
		-That had quite the impact, with Edgar soon enamored with her, saying that he'd
		 set about the work immediately, and work all through the night! He frantically gathered
		 up some tools and then ran out the door to our nearby ship.
		-He lept the gap between dock and ship, heedless of the great plunge between, and began to
		 assess the damage.
			-That rather alarmed Maya.
	-We shouted to the dwarf, asking where his crew could be found, so that we could try our own
	 luck at convincing them to come back to work. We then rushed off to that bar, though Maya
	 opted to stay back and keep an eye on Edgar, to catch him should he fall.
		-Inside the bar, we found a rowdy group of dwarves dressed in identical work uniforms and
		 deep into the booze _flights_ strewn about on the table before them.
		-We sat down with them and I called for another round of the same flights, for all of us,
		 making a proper introduction.
		-Confirming they worked for Edgar, we started to raise the issue of our damaged
		 sail, but were met with laughter as one said, "You should talk to the boss about that. . ."
		 "I did! I replied. "He was doubting you guys could do it. . ."
		 "Well, another replied, we are five rounds deep. . ."
		 "Exactly!" I said, cutting him off. "That's a mere appetizer to dwarves! He seemed to doubt
		  your fortitude. . . But, seeing you lot, I sure don't! Now, look, guys, I hate to delay
		  you reaching the main course, but we are willing to pay for the rush job. . ."
		-We were soon on the way back to the ship, with at least two of the dwarves having trouble
		 walking in a straight line.
		-As we reached the ship, the grinning Edgar told his employees he's joining our
		 crew, and I was of course on board, he being a skilled shipwright.
			-"Cedgar, my son, you're in charge now! You'll just have to add a letter on the sign. . ."
		-The crew then joined their boss in the work.
		-One dwarf, on the drunker end of the crowd, almost immediately fell to his seemingly certain
		 death, but Maya took (magic) wing, swooping down to grab him, and tossed a line back up to
		 D'Roc who hauled the two of them back up.
			-Gazing at D'Roc, that clumsy dwarf muttered, "You know, your remind me of something. . ."
			-The two of them, soon joined by Maya and Jade, discussed a place that D'Roc indeed
			 believed sounded like his long lost home, dwarven legends apparently telling of such a
			 maze.
				-Maya and Jade discussed some arcane quirk of cosmology where mazes are apparently
				 a part of the early formation of a plane.
	-With the repairs underway, our comrades and I spent the time discussing how to deal with the
	 devil.
		-I suggested murder, and Lucien enthusiastically agreed. . .which was good. Some people do
		 take offense to proposals to murder their siblings. . .
		-Jade volunteered that she could create a binding circle, for trapping outsiders, which
		 certainly interested us for the current problem!
			-To set that up, we picked the antechamber to the captain's quarters, and Jade began
			 painstakingly creating an elaborate diagram on the floor in powdered silver.
			-Jade thought she could summon him and bind him in the circle.
			-Lucien even volunteered his blood, the blood of our target's kin, and Jade agreed that
			 she could make use of that to strengthen the ward, solomnly accepting a cup full of his
			 donation.
			-As she worked, Jade warned all of us, "Breaking the circle will free him, as will
			 hostile actions towards him."
				-We conveyed that message to the crew too, telling them to stay out of the room,
				 under any and all circumstances.
	-Jade then commenced the summoning ritual.
		-Soon, the devil faded into view before us, and he greeted Maya warmly.
		-Through gritted teeth, and minding the warning about "hostile actions", Lucien growled,
		 "Nice to see you, brother. So. . . good, to have you back on The Material Plane. . ."
		 "Ah, Maya! I see you civilized him," the demon goaded Lucien. "He's a regular lap dog these
		  days!"
		-Lucien was instantly enraged, and stepped towards the circle.
		-Jade then grabbed his arm, talking to him in low quiet tones, and pulled him towards my
		 bedchamber.
			-I chimed in, "Yeah. . . Play it cool. No need to get _hostile_. . . yet."
		-That left me to play for time with the devil.
			-We talked of booze, The Material, and of how surprisingly similar our homes were.
				-"Huh. Awful, layers, and run by tyrannical jerks. That _does_ sound familiar. . ."
			-He could read a surprising amount about me, though whether is was simple sight, magic,
			 or foreknowledge, and apparently saw in that an opportunity.
				-"Where you come from. . . psionics are common, are they not? You yourself are
				  clearly so empowered. These jerks you speak of. . . I could offer you what every
				  captain dreams of: a treasure map. And one that leads to an artifact that would
				  shield your mind. . ."
				 ". . . Uh. . . Tell me more. . ."
				 "All you would need to do is release me. . ."
			-Jade, though, burst back into the room with a still fuming Lucien.
			-"Fred," she said. "We're going to leave him here for now. . . We need to further
			  discuss how we're going to. . . deal with our guest."
		-We headed out into the hall and down into the other end of the ship. There, discussed our
		 options.
			-Jade had apparently tried something involving a "Spectral Hand" while she was shut in
			 the bedroom, but without luck.
			-She thought she could try again until it worked, given enough time, maybe a week. . .
			-That isn't really time we have right now, but she said she'd be able to compell a
			 service from him, with these arcane tricks, and maybe some negotiation coaching from me.
			-That prompted it's own debate, but one of the most attractive options was a _dual_,
			 with Lucien, Lucien being confident he could take his brother if we set the terms such
			 that he could quickly close and stay close.
	

TODO:
	-(DONE) New shipwright (dwarven expert) crew member. Ask Jake for more details, and figure out if he's
	 a follower or what.
		-Ah, he's fixated on Maya, not me. She doesn't have leadership, but he'll at least be staying
		 aboard ship for the 9 days he's Fanatical towards her.
	-(DONE) Applied +3 Precognition. Remove it.


5/29/24:
	-Jade apparently had more curses up her sleeve, and plenty of time left on her magic binding,
	 so she requested another day to prepare something more, and we eventually assented.
		-"I mean, who knows what's happening to poor Grimble. . . wherever he is?" I complained.
		 "Grimble? He's on the ship!" Bram replied.
		 "Well, _crystal_ Grimble is. . ." I clarified, "But not his soul or whatever."
	-The next morning, Jade's preparations in place, she cursed him still further, from the other
	 room using various magic implements.
	-We then opened up the door to our unpleasantly occupied dining chamber, to reveal a glaring
	 and impatient devil.
		-Maya gave us all a little speech, talking to us about how great we were, and to the devil
		 about an honorable confrontation.
		-Indeed, we then proceeded to negotiate the terms of a duel between Lucien and his brother,
		 which both assented to.
			-I sent one of my gnomish crewmen, Timble, off to grab some snacks, for us in the
			 the audience.
		-The duel itself was almost anticlimactic. Lucien breached the circle with his toe and then,
		 almost before his brother could even brace himself, Lucien drew his blade and slashed the
		 devil in one smooth motion, then finished his reeling sibling with another as he brought
		 the blade, glowing with holy energies, back down.
			-Those energies probably have a lot to do with why the devil basically exploded.
			-I also had to call Timble back, on account of the brevity of the duel, and ask him to
			 fetch some rags instead.
	-That left the room _drenched_ in blood.
		-In fact, Lucien was really _staring_ at his handiwork. Even more strangely, he was soon
		 joined in that by Jade, who staring at blood was a bit less in character for.
		-That mystery was soon explained, though. They fell to discussing the nature of the planes,
		 and bandied about terms like "hemospicy", and eventually clued the rest of us in.
			-Apparently, something about a devil's passage between planes marks it, and they
			 believed they could divine where in The Hells the devil departed from, based on the
			 patterns formed from his bloody demise.
			-Jade then set to recording the splatters _on Lucien_, before the two set to arguing
			 about the patterns in the gore there and elsewhere, and their meanings.
			-They came to the conclusion that he'd left from the seventh level of The Nine Hells,
			 Maladomini, a place ruled by the infernal prince Baalzebul.
	-Well, with that bloody matter settled, we made the ship ready to depart and then sought out
 	 the gnome town my crew had told me about.
		-In the course of the trip from Sharaar Kol, we passed above the Shieldwall Mountains.
		-A short way past the mountains foothils, the air elementals grew restive. I could feel it
		 in the ships handling.
		-Seeking them out below decks, there had been a subtle change in their hue, a grayer tone.
		-Asking them what was wrong, they gave me only vague answers, about a "change in the wind".
		-They seemed to have little idea of what they were feeling themselves, but had instead
		 some instinctive connection to their element.
		-I warned everyone aboard to keep an eye out, and it was a short while later that Bruce
		 called out from the crow's nest (_bat's_ nest?).
		-He had sighted some kind of. . . floating platform? Even with my attention called to it,
		 I could barely make it out in the dark clouds. There was definitely _something_ there,
		 though.
		-We elected to give it a wide berth, and spent a tense dozen minutes on alert while we
		 passed.
		-Pass we did, though, and soon we were clear of the mountains, with the elementals back to
		 normal a short while later.
	-Soon thereafter, we were flying above The Shining Valley.
		-We sighted an elaborate, heavily mechanized dock at one end of the valley, one which my
		 crewman Himble confirmed was operated by the gnomes (and which he proceeded to go on at
		 length about it's many fine mechanical marvels).
		-We brought the ship into a berth on the airdock, and soon I was chatting with the
		 dockmaster.
		-After collecting his fee for the berth, he was _at least_ as enthusiastic about his docks.
		-After some pleasantries, I was soon steering him toward Jade, who was all too happy to
		 talk with him at length about mechanisms, particularly his pride and joy, the modulated
		 sprocket, a. . . thing he'd apparently invented.
			-I _did_ catch the dockmaster mentioning to Jade the many fine and exotic materials
			 available in this settlement, a thing she (and I, though her) might love to take
			 advantage of.
		-Eventually she brought the conversation back around to our need for a priest, and asked
		 for directions.
			-Apparently that was something of a faux pas. He informed us that only gnomes were
			 supposed to know the location of Garl Glittergold's temple.
			-After some wheedling on Maya's part, though, he gave in and revealed that the temple
			 was beneath the settlement.
			-However, to get in, there was an obstacle: admittance to the temple require that we
			 somehow prank one of it's secret guardians. No one knows who they are, but impressing
			 them in this way is what's required to earn their approval, and entry into the temple.
		-Coming up with an impressive prank stumped us for some time. . . so I suggested a bar.
			-Somewhere between my fourth and eighth whiskey, we settled on a scheme, mostly built
			 on a joke Maya suggested: asking for a priest to help my pony. . . because he's a
			 little horse.
			-That soon ballooned into a dragon battle and all sorts of (planned) chaos.
		-It required some spell preparation on Jade and Bruce's parts, though so we turned in for
		 the evening with a plan to execute our prank over the lunch hour tomorrow.
	-The next morning, some miserable gnomish contraption woke me. An "alarm clock" is what the
	 inn's proprietor named it, when I came down and complained.
	-Around lunchtime, we headed to a small public square, outside a popular restaurant.
		-While Jade conjured a pony, I made sure everyone knew their parts in the plan.
		-I then ran at the restaurant, waving my hands over my head, yelling, "Run for your lives!
		 The dragon! The beast! It's here!"
		-D'Roc and the pony were fast on my heels, with, shortly behind them, Maya's tiny dragon
		 and Lucien.
			-The last was cackling evilly in a way that played up his devilish heritage.
			-Sarge also contributed some gouts of flames for the the dragon, bursting in the air
			 overhead.
		-D'Roc picked up the pony and ran past me, but I halted, and shouted, "I'll scare them off!"
		-I then let out the cutest, _least_ intimidating roar I could manage, my best impression of
		 a squeaky kitten, which nonetheless caused Lucien to flee, though without deterring the
		 dragon.
		-Unfortunately, I was not the only one responding to the "attack".
			-Some form of automaton emerged from a nearby alleyway.
			-In an ominous mechanical voice, it demanded calm, and then began encasing nearby
			 gnomes in some kind of domes of force.
		-D'Roc then set the pony down and turned to face the dragon, drawing his axe.
		-They had a quick mock battle and then "struck down" the dragon, which began spurting comical
		 gouts of what I would swear was wine. . . or perhaps it's underage cousin, grape juice.
		-The dragon's "demise" thankfully quieted the construct.
		-I then ran to "my" poney and screamed, adding, "My pony! The dragon got her! I need a
		 priest!"
		-I kept repeating that last bit until I noticed a gnome waving and yelling, from beneath
		 one of the domes.
		-"I'm the priest!" he yelled as I got closer. "But I'm stuck!"
		-D'Roc then shattered the dome with his axe, and the priest stood up as it's shards
		 disintegrated around him.
		-"What's wrong with your pony?" he asked me.
		 "Oh! He's a little horse. . ." I replied, as the horse gave forth Jade's (terrible) singing
		 voice.
	-The gnomish priest groaned loudly, saying, "I see what this is. Fine. . ."
		-He then drew a door with his finger in the dirt of the square beneath him.
		-Grasping it's "knob", he pulled the apparently realer than it looked door open, revealing
		 a stair going downward into the earth.
		-The party gathered around and then descended, emerging into a carnival scene. . .


6/10/24:
	-The temple was filled with gnomes, conjuring illusions, practicing acrobatics, and telling
	 jokes, resulting in the carnival atmosphere.
		-There were though also artificers and engineers, practicing _their_ talents and trades to,
		 dedicating the works to their god.
		-I cast my eyes looking for someone in charge, ring master or high priest either, but it was
		 Maya who first spotted and pointed out that a considerable amount of what we were witnessing,
		 gnomes, furnishings, and even space, were in fact illusions covering a smaller temple and
		 somewhat less worshipers.
		-She also said that she felt there were two factions or schools in the temple, split along
		 the lines of their talents: jokers and artisans.
		-Well, the jokers are clearly Grimble's and my people, and I said as much, suggesting we
		 seek help there.
		-We followed the call of a carnival barker of sorts, which led us to an illusory play of
		 sorts, one telling some tale of a split between gnomes and kobolds.
			-There were also some bits about an eclipse and other astronomical phenomena.
			-I didn't really follow that, though. . . maybe because where I come from doesn't have
			 a sky.
		-We also observed a variety of other displays, shows, and shrines.
			-Another series of illusions showed Garl Glittergold pranking other gods.
				-The pranks were good natured, save where kobolds were concerned.
			-There was also a lavish statue of a gnome with gemstone eyes.
		-Eventually Maya pointed out a particularly unobtrusive gnome, one seemingly repeating lines
		 to himself in one corner.
			-"In this place where little is what it seems, the leader won't be flashy and obvious,"
			 she added.
			-Shrugging in response, I approached the gnome and asked, "What are you working on? Need
			 a stand-in for whatever you're practicing?" I asked.
			 "The tree. . ." he said, "Should it disappear or turn into a T-Rex?"
			 "Uh. . ."
			 "Oh, sorry! You need the context. . ." the gnome added. "I need to impart a moral
			  lesson. Someone stole sacred jewelry, a very grave crime."
			 "What's a T-Rex?" Jade broke in.
			 "Ah, it's a, well, a kind of lizard. . . a very large one," the priest explained.
			 "Oh! Like a dragon?" Maya asked.
			 "Uh, yeah, kind of! But with really short arms. . " the priest replied.
			 "Ah. I think something like that killed a buddy of mine. . ." I said, killing the mood
			 a little bit.
			 "I'm sorry. . ." the priest said. "What happened?"
			 "Well," I explained, "We _did_ learn a moral lesson, one about rushing in without a
			  plan. . ."
				-Adding that last bit, I glared briefly at Maya.
			 "But!" I continued, perking up. "_That's_ why I vote T-Rex. They teach a _mean_ lesson."
			-I then took the opportuninty to steer the conversation around to our own agenda, saying,
			 "Actually, we've need to teach something of a moral lesson of our own. . ."
			-I then told him about my lost friend, Grimble: how he was a paragon of gnomishness,
			 with his great talent for illusions and great sense of humor, and the story of Grimble's
			 mistreatment by Edric.
			-The priest knew of Edric for his industrial pursuits, and generally respected him for
			 them.
			-"The problem is," I explained, "He treats _people_ like _things_. . . and doesn't
			  hesitate to make things out of them."
			-He soon saw the issue, and agreed it was a grave misdeed by someone who clearly needs
			 to lighten up.
			-Seeing the nobility of our cause, and the stick up Ed's ass, he agreed to offer us aid.
			-In particular, he handed us each a small, fragile-seeming gemstone, explaining that, if
			 we break them against a creature, the creature will disappear and be replaced with an
			 illusory double.
				-A handy thing, given Edric's unpleasant interest in yours truely.
				-Bruce even handed his to me, saying his vow of poverty forbids his use of such
				 things.
			-Jade also asked the priest, "What else do you know of The Brotherhood?"
				-He mentioned, in reply, rumors of some kind of falling out, with the various gods
				 of The Brotherhood retreating to their own realms and agendas. "Their shared realm
				 is. . . sort of in disrepair?" he added.
				-He also said that Nikisi had pissed off Myrkul, but that the church of Garl
				 Glittergold actually regarded Enelias rather fondly, for his talents for trickery.
				-The priest also shared that Shawn's adventuring academy is going strong, but
				 concerns itself with the broader cosmic balance more than the rest of The
				 Brotherhood.
				-Beyond the gods, he also mentioned an artificer that had been associated with The
				 Brotherhood, one "2d6", who it's said left enchanted items behind hoping that one
				 day someone would take them up to help The Brotherhood.
					-Jade started fidgeting a bit at that.
					-"Do you think he's still around?" she asked the gnome.
					 "Don't see why not, given that he's a warforged."
			-Given that the priest clearly knew a lot about The Brotherhood, I also asked him about
			 the statue of a gnome with (alarming, to me) crystal eyes.
				-"That's Garl Glittergold himself!" the gnome explained. "It's said that every
				  thousand years or so he even inhabits the statue. Gets up to all sorts of things!"
	-That matter settled, we adjourned to a tavern and returned to discussing our planned approach
	 to The Brotherhood.
		-We talked a bit about The Brotherhood's shared realm, their otherworldly fortress of
		 Xûl-Jarak.
		-Jade also brought up the card game she's been dreaming of for some time, wondering if
		 Edric would be interested in such things.
			-It actually sounded like _very_ much his kind of thing, and I told Jade as much.
			-She rapidly got excited, talking quickly about properties, odds, and the appeal of her
			 cards-and-illusions game.
			-I was eventually able to get a word in edgewise, and cautioned her, saying, "Remember
			 what this is really about, Jade: we need to get Grimble back. . . not find you an
			 investor."
			-She nodded solomnly, in response.
			-Well, it's at least another bargaining chip. . .
		-Sarge also raised aid from others of The Brotherhood, a thing I'm more amenable to than I
		 was before we learned The Brotherhood wasn't exactly in the perfect harmony the teachers
		 described to me back in the creche.
			-Jade ran with that too, talking of where she might be able to find more keys for her
			 orb.
			-She also suggested that she and Maya could both reach out, via their magic books, to
			 their people in Sasserine, asking them to (discretely) inquire with any churches of
			 the gods of The Brotherhood in Sasserine, about their gods' interests and agendas.
				-They indeed spent some time scribbling to their correspondents, and conferring
				 with one another about what instructions to give.
		-Jade also continued to have an unhealthy interest in her orbs and the keys that fit within
		 it. She kept insisting that more keys. . . would somehow help, but couldn't seem to say
		 exactly what they would do.
			-Drawing on the gnome priest's story about 2d6, and some claims of a "harmonious"
			 purpose for the artifact, Jade made the case for her study of it. . . Well, she figured
			 that harmony can't be bad, right?
			-I was quick to correct her, "It's for the harmony _of The Brotherhood_! That's not what
			 _we_ want. We're sitting here debating if we can use divisions in The Brotherhood to
			 our advantage here. . ."
			-She did insist, though, that the orb and it's purpose might be something Edric would
			 be willing to bargain for. Which, fair enough.


8/5/24:
	-We talked a few last details over, but even I had run out of excuses to avoid going home.
		-The only additional thing we prepared was another plane shift scroll, crafted by Jade as
		 we were worried that bringing Grimble back with us would push us over the limit of the
		 spell.
	-So, we finally performed the plane shift, all of us grasping hands in a circle as Jade recited
	 the incantation from the scroll, to take us to the (far smaller) demiplane on which The
	 Brotherhood had constructed it's planar nexus, and Xûl-Jarak clone.
	-The world shifted and twisted and, as it melted back into intelligible shapes, we found ourselves
	 standing before a forboding fortress: all sharp angles and made from a black metal.
		-"Ugh," I said. "That did not play nice with the red wine I had for breakfast. . . Next
		  time, I'm sticking to white before plane shifting."
		-Forboding though it was, it was hardly devoid of life: there were various groups of all
		 sorts of creatures, scattered across it's ramparts and battlements.
		-I approached a nearby group of halfling-sized rat people, saying, "Hello, there my fuzzy
		  friend! Do you think you could help us with some directions!
			-He was well-mannered and helpful both, and more than happy to show us around.
			-I explained to him that I was from Edric's Enlightened Spheres, and looking to head
			 home, but he was also very proud of the copy-fort, eagerly pointing out various
			 landmarks.
				-He was a big fan of Shawn's adventuring academy, suggesting we consider classes
				 there, and pointing it out to us.
				-He also showed us the tavern, which, were Grimble's fate less urgent, _I_ would be
				 a very big fan of.
					-Actually, D'Roc was quite interested too, after our ratman guide mentioned Dog.
					-Apparently, some of the trophies on the wall were _his_, brought back from the
					 god's hunting grounds.
					-D'Roc was very interested in reaching his god's promised land, and, indeed, the
					 ratman explained they could be reached from here, _if_ the petitioner proved
					 himself a worthy hunter (at which he gestured to some of the trophies).
						-There was even a bounty board of sorts: posted reports of great beasts,
						 whose slaying would bring the favor of Dog.
						-Most prominent among them was a Nightmare, a black horse wreathed in flames
						 that had been sighted in the frontier nation of Q'barra, 
				-He also showed us a space he referred to as the throne room, but said it was mostly
				 used to host a regular market, though we'd come on the wrong day.
			-Intriguing as all that was, I had to press the matter of my route. . . home.
			-"Oh!" he said. "If you have the key, there's a portal you can activate with it, in the
			  throne room. Or. . . there are open portals in the basement, but it's been infested
			  for a millennia."
			 "There rats down there?" D'Roc asked, insensitively.
				-I, standing behind the ratman, waved my hands, trying to mime that D'Roc should
				 knock it off, and pointing at our guide.
			 "Hmph. . . No. Undead," he replied.
			-Another of his kind then called out, waving to him, saying, "Beauregard!"
			 "Oh! That's my wife," our guide explained. "Well, best of luck to you all! Coming, my
			  dear!"
			-"Well, Jade. . . Do we have the right key?" I asked.
				-She nodded, and got to fishing about in her orb.
				-Withdrawing a black adamantine one, Jade wandered to the far end of the throne room
				 and, indeed finding a keyhole on the wall opposite the main entrance, she inserted
				 and turned the key.
				-That transformed the wall into a rippling portal, and we all stepped through.
	-This time, we found ourselves in a desert scattered with wreckage: The Borderlands.
		-"D'Roc, we need to find a hole, to descend to a lower layer. There's probably a lot of
		  traffic in and out so. . . see any tracks?"
		-He nodded and got to looking.
		-Something caught his eye near the rusty hulk of some enormous. . . airship, maybe?
			-It was half embedded in the sand in any case.
			-He followed some trail over to a great rent in the old hulk.
			-As he approached the dark opening, though, he halted, shaking his head as if to clear
			 it.
			-"Uh, D'Roc?" I called out. "Don't go listening to any voices!"
			-He babbled something about a "chittering". . . and soon we could hear it too.
		-The source was soon revealed, as a band of thri-kreen appeared from the rent in the wreck,
		 some of them aboard a strange, rumbling machine.
			-They had their weapons at the ready and Sarge was already reaching for his spell
			 component pouch, but I tried to de-escelate things.
			-Raising my hands away from my swordbelt, I called out, to bug and buddy both, "Be cool!
			  We're here because Edric called for us. You don't want to piss off _god_ do you?"
			-The thri-kreen seemed to follow at least _some_ Common, as they took a step or two back,
			 lowering their weapons.
			-We began some linguistically-impaired negotiation, mostly consisting of Maya and I
			 dancing.
			-Dance proved to be a rather universal language, and Maya, in particular, seemed to get
			 across that. . . I was the son of god and needed to go see my father.
			-Well, it got the job done, as one of them began to draw a map in the sand.
			-It indeed featured a hole, but also. . . what I thought, at first, was a thri-kreen,
			 but which the one drawing seemed to be taking pains to make. . . ant-like?
				-In any event, it was depicted between us and the hole.
			-That sparked a recollection from my childhood. In one of the rare, exciting bits of
			 creche classes that actually held my attention, I rembered learning about the thri-kreen
			 that roved The Borderlands _and their formian rivals_.
			-Well, grasping the problem, I proposed a solution: I danced forward, recoiled from the
			 drawing of the ant man, and then danced back forward and stomped the ant man.
			-The thri-kreen seemed to take my meaning, excitedly chittering amongst themselves before
			 one of the ones on the strange machine made a clear "hop on" gesture, which we happily
			 obliged.
	-We rode the bug men's strange sand ship quite a ways through the desert until it seemed to run
	 (more?) aground, the sands having grown rockier.
		-The Thri-kreen managed to indicate to us that we should now get out and walk, gesturing to
		 a rocky ridge that was visible in the distance.
		-Some of the insect band also gestured back and forth between the ridge and their weapons,
		 and it was clear to me they meant to fight alongside us.
	-We approached the rocky ridge and could soon see that portions of the stone had been worked
	 into a kind of fortress, with taller constructions inside.
		-We discussed scouting the place in some way, and eventually settled on the three of us that
		 could fly taking a look from above.
		-When they glided back down, they reported a bustling hive of activity, with numerous antmen
		 digging away at the rock, overseen by larger members of their race.
		-They also mentioned other, very different insects, possessed of wings, up on the ridge.
			-They were much larger, perhaps 10' long.
			-Bruce termed them "spider-eaters", and said one of them was doing just that, chowing
			 down on a giant spider.
		-We debated our options at length and settled on. . . another frontal assault, like the one
		 that killed my last bug buddy.
			-But, this time, we would send _summoned creatures_ in first, Jade having volunteered
			 the newly learned ability to summon giants.
	-We crept forward to the opening in the ridge that clearly served as a front gate to the
	 fortress and, once we were 20 or so feet away, Jade barked some arcane symbols, summoning a
	 pair of stone giants that then charged forward through the gap.
		-They were met by some of the larger formians, the ones that had been directing the workers.
		-One stared intently at one of the giants, in a way that felt awfully familiar to me, but
		 the giant appeared unphased.
		-D'Roc loosed some arrows at one of the ant people, to no avail as the shot went wide.
		-Far more effective was boulder one of the giants grabbed and hurled at the formian
		 taskmaster, which cracked it's exoskeleton horribly, letting flow a disgusting goo, though
		 the formian kept his feet.
		-Our thri-kreen allies then lept (literally) into the fray, as the formians formed up into
		 organized ranks and things devolved into a general melee.
		-I also began to feel an ominous rumbling, coming from the earth beneath me. . .
		-I took a shot with my bow at some kind of rock monster that emerged from one of the
		 buildings, and then darted behind a rock to use it for cover.
		-Moments later, another (or the same?) rock monster emerged from the sand near my rocky
		 cover, casting about it's eyeless face, clearly looking for me, but to no avail.
		-I stabbed it with my rapier, which merely scratched it's rocky carapace, and I tumbled
		 backwards out of it's reach.
		-The rumbling reached it's crescendo, then, as a huge rock monster emerged from the sand
		 just inside the gate and began smashing our thri-kreen allies.
			-Why always my bug buddies?!?
		-I tried to lock the huge rock man's mind, to prevent further bug smashing, but it managed
		 to resist me.
		-Thankfully, it couldn't resist D'Roc's axe, with which he cleaved it in twain.
		-As the rock monster crumbled, so to did the earth beneath him, eventually forming a hole
		 15' across, through the layer.
	-The party and I dashed towards the hole and dived in.
		-I gave a wave to our remaining bug buddies as I did so. They were now driving the remaining,
		 demoralized formians back into a retreat.
		-As we fell through the hole, the still shifting sides of the hole expelled numerous
		 gemstones, which we grasped at greedily as the tumbled in the air around us.
		-The gravity (and stomach) flip that I knew was coming seemed to quite bother the others
		 and it was the first thing they brought up when we were flung out on the topside of the
		 next layer, rather than our shiny windfall.
			-"Why is it _like_ that?!?" Jade asked.
			 "Eh, you get used to it. Plus, the elans here often don't bother eating, so it probably
			  doesn't hit them as hard," I explained.
		-We then fell to sorting through the gems, and I found I'd managed to snag the most precious
		 of them, a blue star sapphire.
			-"I got the best one!" I exclaimed. "Hey. I caught a _star_! You all saw it!"

	-(DONE!) Applied Precognition. Remove it!
	-(DONE!) Update Jump for Haste +12 from speed.


8/19/24:
	-This new layer featured more industrial scenery: titanic metal structures and great machines.
	-There was, however, rather little activity. We didn't see any people about, and most of the
	 machinery was idle.
	-_Most_, but not all. Some short distance away, we could hear the hiss of steam coming from a
	 clanking conveyor belt that kept starting and then haulting.
		-We walked that way, following what we hoped were signs of life.
		-Approaching the machinery, we could see scorched spots on the belt, outlining, in each
		 case, a pair of footprints?
		-There were also more literal signs, ones warning about wearing safety helmets, to avoid. . .
		 implantation?
	-As we followed the stalled belt onward, the are got progressively. . . slimier, a wet green-ish
	 muck covering any and, soon, most surfaces
		-Maya spotted it _moving_.
		-"Oh, I think I remember what this is. . ." I said. "It's my great, great, great, great. . .
		  you get the idea, uncle. He had the same inborn psionics as I do, and Edric tried to turn
		  him into an elan. This was the thing that resulted. . . They say it still shows evidence
		  of _thinking_. . ."
		-I bent to scrape some of it off my boot, and got quite a bit more than evidence: it began
		 _talking_.
		-"Remember what I said about listening to voices!" I shouted to the rest.
		-The voice in my head, though, which the others seemed to also hear as soon as they touched
		 the slime, was staying instead, "Come to the center. . ."
		-I reacted by backing away slowly.
		-"Don't go!" it "said". "I'm Rovert. Who are you?"
		 "Ah. . . Uh, I'm Fred."
		 "You're Fred! Oh! It's good to meet you," the slime "said".
		 "You've heard of me?"
		 "You're the new PR guy that was supposed to be coming," it explained.
		 "Uh. . . "
		 "You know, spread the message to the Material Plane and all that! Recruit followers."
		 "Ohhh. Not a resident position, then. Well. . . do you know know who I need to talk to
		  about that?"
		 "Well, there's a tribe of kobolds?"
		 "Are they. . . like, HR, then?"
		 "Kind of! They're a bit less. . . changed, then a lot of Edric's thralls."
		-Maya then broke in asking, "Is that why you're slime?"
		 "Well, that was the result of an experiment," the slime said. "Someone pulled the wrong
		  lever. Then there was slime everywhere. . . and I _was_ the slime. It was my penance."
		 "Wait," I then said, "It was just a mistake?"
		 "Well," the voice-of-the-slime replied, "Edric said it was a cautionary tale. If you fail,
		  you're slime."
		 "Look," it continued, "Can you do me a favor? Scoop up a ball of the slime and bring it to
		  Edric. I'd really like to talk to Edric, and ask him if my penance is done."
		 "Uh. . . Jade?" I asked. "Go ahead and scoop that up. . . She's my go-to for magical stuff
		  that. . . I don't want to touch."
		-We briefly debated containers, and it turned out Jade had a rum bottle.
		 "Rum!" Rovert exclaimed. "I remember rum. . ."
		 "Can you still. . . drink rum?" Maya asked.
		 "I can feed on all _kinds_ of things these days," it replied.
		-Well, I grabbed the bottle from Jade, took a swig from it, and poured the rest into the
		 slime.
		-It seemed to appreciate the rum, making approving "noises", and Jade scooped some into the
		 emptied bottle I handed back to her.
		-"So, where to with this, Rov?" I asked.
		 "The nearest column is over there," it replied, illustrating it's point by forming a vague
		  psuedopod from the slime in the jar, pointing at a metal structure reaching all the way
		  up to the surface above us. ". . .but you'll have to get past the rest of me."
		 "Uh, what?"
		-It went on to explain that it's not so. . . unified, as once it was, and it doesn't all
		 agree with itself. We'd need to confront some dissenting opinions at the column.
	-Well, we walked over to the column.
		-There, we found the column's interior was heavily coated in slime.
		-As we approached the mass of slime, many mouths formed on it, all gibbering a discordant
		 cacophony of competing voices.
		-It. . . was almost like the chatter. . . back in school. . . I'd struggled to ignore that
		 too.
		-Then, I _was_ back in school. I'd forgotten my homework. . .
		-"No more homework. . ." I protested, futily, over and over again.
	-Eventually, I realized most of the babbling I could still hear was me. . . and that I could
	 also hear. . . singing?
		-As I regained my sense, I found Maya had coaxed the mouths into a chorus.
			-A bit flat, but better than the babbling!
		-With the babbling stopped, Bruce flew up with a rope, and we climbed it to follow.
	-Reaching the next surface, we found far more activity than the abandoned area given over to
	 Rovert.
		-There were tiny constructs swarming all over the place, building things from metal.
		-Noticing us, several, then many more, approached us, and lights on their bodies began to
		 blink.
		-Lucien then. . . showed them his sword? Well, actually, he caused it to repeatedly wreath
		 itself in flames and then extinguish. . . blinking back.
		-That actually got somewhere. One of the otherwise silent constructs spoke up, repeating,
		 "Boxes. Safe in boxes."
		-The party fell to arguing with them, there being lots of back and forth along those lines
		 and none of us being to keen to be placed into any kind of box.
		-The construct _did_ mention being "safe from implantation", which called something to mind.
		-"Ohhh," I said. "Can you guys make _small_ boxes? Something we could put on top of our
		  heads?"
		-They proved eager to help and soon we had helmets for those of us that lacked them.
			-I even talked them into making a fashionably red one for me.
		-With the constructs in so good a mood, I figured it was an opportune time to ask them, 
		 "How do we get down to the next layer from here?"
		-The construct said a lot about a "permanent box". Eventually, I worked out it meant a
		 large building a little bit away.
	-We said our goodbyes and approached the building, which was also surrounded by a fair bit of
	 activity: humanoid creatures, marching in uncanny unison.
		-We tried a variety increasingly strident methods for getting their attention, culminating
		 in Maya and Lucien slapping a couple of them, but we got no response from the blank faced
		 people.
		-D'Roc could almost reach the windows of the factory, though, and boosted Lucien up.
		-Lucien reported that, inside, a scorpion was stabbing the heads of golems. . . and also
		 that the window opened.
		-"Well, helmets everyone!" I called out.
		-We clambered through the window, and onto the factory's catwalks, which proved to hang
		 above many levels of conveyor belts, stretching far below the level we'd reached up to the
		 window from.
			-Those conveyors indeed featured many humanoid golems, that some kind of crystalline
			 scorpians were indeed doing. . . something to the heads of.
		-There, we caught sight of someone who was perhaps some kind of supervisor, dressed in
		 coveralls and seemingly patroling the catwalks.
		-Naturally, we hid.
		-Maya attempted some kind of distraction with her illusion cards, calling into being the
		 illusion of a humanoid woman in furs.
		-That seemed to just result in the supervisor turning and jogging off, pulling something
		 from his clothes. Lucien said he could hear the supervisor saying something about needing
		 backup. . .
		-Well, I knew that was likely to mean more, angrier constructs, so I suggested we get the
		 hells out of there.
	-We needed to descend to the next layer, so we opted to use a rope to climb down to one of the
	 conveyer belts we could see, roughly 40' below us.
	-Unfortunately, as the last of us descended, a huge astral construct smashed through the wall
	 near one end of the belt, striding ominously forward.
		-Lucien wasted no time and ran forward to meet it. It swung for him, but he ducked low and
		 then slashed at it repeatedly with his sword to. . . some effect.
		-I being less confident in the impact of arrows on that tower of ectoplasm, I ran at it
		 too. . . and dived between it's legs and through the rent in the wall it came from.
		-I found myself in a shaft, lined with more conveyer belts, that sloped steeply up and down.
		-"I think I found our way down, guys!" I called out.
		-Meanwhile, D'Roc joined Lucien at hacking away at the construct, while Sarge blasted it
		 with flames.
		-For it's part, it struggled to connect with Lucien, though that didn't dissuade it from
		 swinging at him again and again in a flurry of blows.
		-It continued to get the worse of the exchange with the party until it was shattered to
		 slowly dissipating globs of ectoplasm.
	-We followed the shaft downward, emerging into a seemingly endless field of crystalline tubes,
	 many housing various humanoids.
		-There was also an announcement blaring from. . . somewhere, and repeating in various
		 languages instructions to retreat to safety while the emergency is "addressed".
		-Not caring for the sound of that last, we briefly discussed options for a distraction, to
		 cover our escape.
		-I asked Maya if she'd like to play a game of cards and, saying that she'd love to, she
		 drew forth a card and called into being the image of a huge (and distracting) iron golem.
		-She sent it running off down a throughfare, while we hastily headed the opposite direction,
		 losing ourselves in the field of tubes.
	-Soon the sound of pursuit and alarms faded, and we were free to explore the area, to find our
	 way futher into Edric's realm.
	-It was Bruce that identified a tube that differed from the others.
		-Rather than a solid floor, it's base opened into a shaft descending deeper into the plane.
		-However, it was barely big enough for Bruce, and far too small for the rest of us.
		-Sarge saw to fixing that with a spell he named Shatter, crumbling both the tube and the
		 rock of the shaft it sat above, widening the opening.
	-The widened passage led to a layer over which a great cathedral-like structure sprawled,
	 seemingly encompassing the whole plane.
		-On one side of the cloistered courtyard we'd emerged into, there stood a great door, which
		 opened at our arrival, welcoming us inside (though I felt chilled at the sight).
		-Maya, though, drew us up short, and gave a speech. She spoke of our great accomplisments
		 thus far, and the majestic fates that awaited us in the future, and we all took heart.
		-As we walked through the doors, though, we felt a powerful compulsion to kneel.
		-I was intent on dealing from position of strength, though, and, drawing on how Maya's
		 speech left me feeling, I stood tall.
		-We found ourselves before a great adamantine throne, on which was seated Edric.
			-He'd long ago twisted himself far from mortal form, and now was a great, gleaming
			 crystalline figure, strange and alien.
		-My attention, though, was drawn to what stood beside it: a crystal tube with Grimble in it.
		-I didn't hesitate to harangue, yelling, "Hey! That's _my_ righthand gnome!"
		-Edric then spoke, demanding of me, "Did you spread my good word to The Material Plane?"
		 "I thought I was bringing information _back_," I replied.
		 "It flows both ways. . ." the god said. "And what of my ship?"
		 "I. . . replaced it. Why, Jade here is quite the shipwright! Her craftsmanship. . ."
		 "And what of it's crew? Those who set out with you?"
		 "Eh, they didn't last ten minutes. . . But! The crew I've found has done so much. . .
		  It's why I need Grimble back! He's essential to the operation! And, I've brought _your_
		  right hand back to you. . . Jade, where's that rum bottle?"
		 "Ah, Rovert. . . Such a disappointment, what happened. . ."
		-Seeing the god reminisce, Maya spoke up, saying, "Is this really what you wanted, when
		 you were mortal?"
		-That pissed him right off, and he did. . . something. She fell to the ground, facedown.
		-She quickly stirred, though, thankfully, and, seemingly groggy, regained her feet. She then
		 shook her head, as if to clear it, and spoke again, saying, "Lord Edric, what _we_ want
		 is Grimble back. No less and no more. . ."
		 "I bought him," the god replied.
		 "Stole him!" I was quick to correct.
		 "Bought. And let us speak then of what I want. . ." the god began. "Business has slowed.
		  During the last war, anyone would offer up any treasure in exchange for ships and
		  material. I want such markets again."
		 "Well, OK," I replied. "I've got information on that front, angles on offer. Take Maya, for
		  example. She clearly means to be queen of Sasserine, and certainly wouldn't mind an
		  armada. . ."
		-Maya saw no need to deny that, and was, I think, rather intrigued by the notion of a fleet.
		-In any event, she and Edric fell to haggling.
			-He was pushing her for more than simply buying a fleet. He wanted a _war_, something to
			 drive sales to all sides.
			-She, meanwhile, was very insistent that Grimble be returned to us, now and unchanged.
			-For my part, if she was willing to burn her world to give me Grimble back, I guess I
			 wasn't going to stop her. . .
		-It seemed they'd come to terms. A crystal collar formed around Grimble's neck, the tube
		 opened, and then Edric pushed Grimble towards us.
		-"Grimble!" I shouted, stepping towards him. "Long time, no see! . . . are you OK?"
		-But Maya spoke up again before Grimble did. "I said he would be unmolested," she stated,
		 gravely.
		 "He is himself," the god replied. "The collar will simply return him to me, should you not
		  hold to your end of the bargain and sell the fleets."
		-It then became clear that Maya was trying to do _exactly_ what I told her not too, as she
		 inisted, "I said I would _consider_ doing so. And I have. . ."
			-Maya was trying to trick a god. A god of the mind.
			-I think she may have tried going even further, as some of her words seemed freighted
			 with the arcana granted her by her patron wyrm. If so, it would seem to have failed.
			-I cannot say that I can recall for sure what exact words she or the god spoke and
			 agreed to, preoccupied as I was while watching a young girl argue with my worst
			 nightmare over the fate of my friend's soul. . .
			-The two began to argue, but it was clear that Edric was not going to meekly let us
			 claim Grimble through wordplay.
		-As Edric was about to pull Grimble back, Maya drew out the platinum cloak she'd been given
		 by her dragon god and, wrapping it around him, said, "Grimble, at least take your cloak!"
	-In a sudden flash, we were then elsewhere. We stood before a desk, behind which sat a silvery-
	 scaled dragonborn.

9/16/24: The Trial, and the After. . . party
	-This was clearly not where I'd parked my airship. . . a sentiment I gave voice to.
	-"Oh, traffic is down the hall," the dragonborn responded to that.
	-". . . wait. _You're_ the ones here about that gnome," he added.
	 "Oh! Yeah! What do you know about Grimble?" I asked.
	-He went on to explain what we'd asked for by wrapping Grimble in Bahamut's cloak: the judgement
	 of gods.
		-There would be a panel of three gods.
		-"Edric has already chosen a kobold. . . kind-of. . . god?" the scaly functionary said to
		 us. "He's called Kurtulmak. You'll need to pick one judge as well, another lawful god."
			-"Who paid attention that day of class?" I asked. "Maya?"
			-That led to some debate, with Maya listing various lawfully aligned gods.
			-I seized on her mention of Moradin, breaking in and saying, "Oh! Yeah, Moradin would
			  work. Dwarves love gnomes! And gnomes love dwarves. . . and the dwarves we've met like
			  us well, enough. . . Yeah, that'll do!"
		-"There will also be a third, neutral diety on the tribunal, to arbitrate. . ." the
		 dragonborn added.
	-Within seconds, and with another sudden flash, we were in a new room, though one of a common
	 style with the functionary's room.
		-At one table sat Edric, along with a scholarly-looking kobold and several constructs
		 flipping through paperwork.
		-We stood before a table of our own, and there were three empty podiums on a platform before
		 us.
		-In the center of the chamber, there was Grimble, contained within a crystal column.
			-I tentatively waved to him, and received a wave back, but it was slow and. . .
			 multifluous? His arm seemed to blur into many arms, all waving out of sync and at
			 slightly different angles. . .
		-"All rise!" called out a winged, angelic  baliff to our left.
		-The baliff then heralded each god in turn, as they materialized before their podiums. There
		 were:
			-"The Soul Forger, Moradin!"
			-"Death's Guardian, Wee Jas!"
			-"And The Gnomesmasher, Kurtulmak!"
	-Their eyes all turned to us, then, Edric's accusers, as they waited expectantly.
		-"I am no enemy to Edric," I began. "I am a creation of Edric's myself, but one mistreated
		  every step along the way.
		  Grimble, though, was no part of my relationship with Edric, and had his soul claimed just
		  to send me a _message_. 
		  And we would have sought his resurrection! Edric denied life _and_ proper after life to
		  him, over a dispute he was no part of."
		-Edric then droned through his response, saying, "I did not mistreat Fredrick. Everything
		  of his life was as it needed to be, as best served the realms material and divine. Perfect.
		  Grimble died when one of his own companions' own rage was reflected back by a natural
		  formation of crystals. I simply purchased his soul, which no god laid claim do, following
		  the proper procedure."
	-Edric was first to present evidence.
		-He drew forth a string of crystals, in which tiny moving images and, concentrating a moment
		 while holding one, he conjured forth the image of a scene. . . the scene of Grimble's death.
			-I got to witness again his destruction by a burst of terrible energy.
		-Jade called out to the tribunal, though, saying, "This scene has been manipulated, stripped
		 of it's emotional context! It is meant to mislead."
		-Moradin at least was persuaded, and called to see the _whole_ of the context.
			-Mostly, that meant seeing my grieving over poor Grimble. . .
	-Seizing the initiative, Maya then asked to speak on my behalf and, when I gestured that she
	 should go ahead, she proceeded to speech-ify.
		-It was long on tenets of divine law, principals of divine interference, and, perhaps most
		 importantly, flattery of our divine judges.
		-To be honest, it was a bit much to my ears, but also seemed exactly the kind of lengthy
		 polite rambling that our divine judges would want to hear.
		-"Well said!" I shouted out at the end.
	-Following that, Moradin asked to see the crystal containing the scene of Grimble's death, and
	 was duely obliged.
		-The Dwarfather performed some magic, conjuring visions of Grimble's soul going to
		 Glittergold, and then pronounced the crystal a forgery!
			-"The gnome's soul _would_ have been delivered to Garl Glittergold," he said, "But it
			  was snatched away!"
		-"Of course he belonged to Glittergold," I agreed. "He was a paragon of gnomishness, in his
		  illusions and his humor both. Though he seldom thought of the gods, he was Glittergold's
		  through and through."
		-The kobold god was unsurprisingly unpersuaded and yelled out, "It was purchased! Glittergold
		  will not have him!"
	-Wee Jas meanwhile looked stern. . . but skeptical of Kurtulmak, at least.
	-Maya took the opportunity to suggest a remedy, saying, "If I could propose a solution? Grimble's
	  soul could be remanded to _my_ care, and him returned to life? Then, the matter of his soul's
	  destination can be settled by Grimble himself?"
		-That prompted sputtering from Kurtulmak. . . and glaring at Maya from me. _Her_ care?
	-Wee Jas then spoke, saying, "No, not life. . . Something between. Pulled between mortal and god,
	  he will be pulled between life and death, as they fe are."
	-With that the crystal column surrounding Grimble disolved, Grimble spouted butterfly wings, and
	 he began to flutter around the chamber.
	-He only had a few seconds to do so, though, as, in a blink, we found ourselves in a temple of
	 Moradin that. . . wait, this was _Sharaar Kol!_
	-I simply stared at Grimble, hardly having believed he would ever be returned to me. . .
	-That revery was broken by an apology from Maya, who said, "Fred, my request that Grimble be
	  given over to me. . . I only meant to see him returned to life and released.
	 "I. . . I'm sure you meant well," I replied. "I'm just a bit sensitive about gnome-theft right
	  now. . ."
	-"This. . . this deserves a party! The _biggest_ party!" I began to ramble. "We'll get ahold of
	  the party lizard. . . Grimble! We're in Sharaar Kol. . . Lets go to that bar with the dancing!"
	-The two of us began to walk out of the temple and into the corridor, but then I turned around,
	 saying, "Oh, yeah! Jade! I've got a Wand of Sending with a charge left, but can you do anything
	 similar? We should send a message to The Party Lizard!"
		-It turned out she could in fact add some temporary charges to the wand, so we fell to
		 discussing who we should send invites out to.
		-Folks that came to my mind:
			Party Lizard
			"Those deep gnomes we rescued are fun! The ones that think we're gods?"
			"The High Priest of Moradin is cool, and probably right around here somewhere."
			"Who else survived one of my parties. . . Well, you guys. . ."
	-Soon we were at the bar, and all sorts of people were turning up, probably helped by me shouting
	 invites to everyone we passed.
		-As things at the bar began to get rolling, though, Maya was standing off by herself,
		 looking a little shell-shocked, so I walked up to her and thrust a full glass of wine into
		 her hand.
			-"I know that look. . . that's the look of someone who needs to drink something away,"
			 I said to her.
			-"I. . . never met a god before. . ." she began, than chugged the whole glass, proving
			 me right.
		-Soon, some music started up, with a shirtless half-orc on stage yelling, "We are The
		 Bardvarians!" before launching into something loud.
		-A short bit later, several dwarven defenders marched into the bar, shouting, "Make way for
		 his highness!"
			-They were soon followed by the king himself, shouting, "Make way. . . to the bar!
			  We're doing shots!"
			-I insisted the bartender pour a couple into my bottle of Rov-slime, which was met with
			 a suitable thumbs up gesture from the slime.
		-Maya still seemed a bit out of sorts, though, rather than her usual bubbly self.
			-She began to debate aloud what she should do with herself next after. . . all this.
			-She seemed unsure what she wanted now. . . but seized upon Sarge, who had mentioned
			 a long while back wishing to see his homeland again.
				-A chance to focus on another's needs seemed to focus _her_. . . and Sarge certainly
				 _did_ deserve a vacation. Can't say I'd ever been before either, which is a mark in
				 it's favor.
		-After he performed some acrobatics, we also briefly tried to encourage Lucien to become
		 what I billed as "The World's Scariest Devil-Mime".
			-He was not on board. . . though used it to make a horrifying joke, proving the concept
			 had legs.
			-After he started dipping into his Abyssal liqour, he also started mumbling, "Maybe I
			  should go see my family. . . the _good_ ones. . . "
		-Lucien also took a moment to pour some Abyssal Temptation into the Rov-bottle.
			-That resulted in (visible to everyone!) tiny Ed and tiny Fred on it's. . . "shoulders".
			-"Woo! Go slime-Fred!" I called out, as a familiar struggle ensued.
			-My victory was clear, and the slime turned from green to red. . .
		-Grimble, for his part, turned summersaults in the air, until his alcohol content rendered
		 that unwise, and then began to conjure illusory scenes from his weird adventures beyond
		 death.


TODO:
	-(DONE!) Figure out Grimble XP implications.
		-Fred just got 600, which needs to be added to Grimble's total after applying the formula.
		-But, also look into what this means longterm, if it might render Grimble permanently many
		 levels behind.
			-Well, looks like he's already level 6, so it'd be pretty hard to argue that anything
			 he lost in return for his new sort-of-fey properties was an unfair trade.
	-(DONE!) Note down Grimble's new properties:
		-fey-like; butterfly wings; 5/cold iron; must be completely truthful; fly 2x normal speed (good maneuverability)
		-Wrote it down in his Spells spreadsheet, but see what fits in Fantasy Grounds too.
			-Done!


9/30/24:
	-During the party, I led a very drunk Squee over to Jade, to ask her if if she'd ever heard
	 of "The End of Infinity".
		-(With Squee being unable to die, I saw no reason not to egg him onto terrible feats of
		  liqour consumption.)
		-Jade thought that _did_ sound like something, a term she'd heard to describe the space
		 _between_ planes. A place that still harbored. . . creatures.
		-". . . end? . . . or 'nother gruesome. . . " Squee mumbled.
		 ". . . yeah!" I cut in. "This one of those tentacle monster situations, Jade?"
			-That was just met with a shrug from Jade.
		-"I guess if you were to visit the Negative or Positive energy planes. . ." Jade began.
		 "Trrrriiied," Squee slurred in response.
		-That met with some incredulity from my . . . friends, and D'Roc to ask, "How long have you
		  been around, Squee?"
			-By way of response, he pulled out a small, tattered book, and began leafing drunkenly
			 through it.
			-It was filled with crude tallies, which he dragged his finger along haphazardly while
			 muttering various numbers before blurting, "Lost count. *Hic*"
			-After some further questions from various people, they eventually concluded it had been
			 _at least_ a millenia.
				-That's a hell of a long time. I wonder if he can trade his "curse" to me. . .
	-The dwarvern bar actually managed to _run out of beer_, to much jeering from all around.
		-"Well get some more!" I demanded of the bartender.
		 "You don't understand!" he shouted back. "The whole damned _city_ is out now!"
		 "I thought you dwarves were supposed to be industrious! Running out of beer. . . Who can
		  conjure us some more!" I walked off shouting.
		-Jade saved the day by conjuring up more kegs.
	-Eventually, the party did wind down. I woke the next morning, still in the bar and thoroughly
	 hung over, surrounded by scattered deep gnomes.
		-It was the breakfast rush that woke me, an assortment of dwarves digging into food and ale
		 before shifts in the mines.
	-Rather than endure any more of their noise or their joking(?) offers to pick up a mining shift,
	 we gathered ourselves up and got to leaving.
		-On the way out of the bar, D'Roc pointed out the glint of. . . glass? In a nearby alley?
		-Bruce saw it too, and I was quick to ask, "The glint of gems maybe? Treasure?!?"
		 "No. . ." D'Roc said. "It moved?"
		 "Moved?!? Some construct or the like? Which way was it?!? I'm going the other!" I rambled.
		-I began to hurry off in a random direction, but then a voice called out saying, "Wait!
		  Stay in the frame!"
		-A trio of odd looking humanoids then emerged from the alley, one of them bearing a crystal
		 studded device.
		-That last still had me quite alarmed, but they eventually got it across that they wanted an
		 interview, for some kind of interplanar newspaper.
		-Hearing that, I said, "Ah! Adoring fans! I get those _all_ the time, and hardly _ever_ get
		 them killed!"
		-They looked a bit alarmed at the last bit, but pressed on, asking for the story of my
		 recent court case.
		-I began to regale them with the tragic story of my childhood in Edric's realm.
		-After several minutes of that, one broke in with a question, saying, "Do you have any
		  family? Someone who could corroborate your story?"
		 "Sure! I replied, pulling out a half full bottle. "This is my great, great, great, great,
		  great, Uncle Rov!"
		-That bottle proved to contain rum, though, so, after a swig, I spent another moment digging
		 the bottle of slime out of my haversack.
		-"Uncle Rov! My adoring fans want to interview us!" I said, addressing the bottle.
		-By way of response, the slime formed a head and the approximation of some hair, and then
		 smoothed the "hair" back with a psuedopod.
		-"Why are you in a bottle?" one of the reporters then asked. "Seems like a story there?"
		 "Well, your conciousness gets fractured, manifests as slime, gets scooped up by your
		  nephew. You know how it goes!"
		 ". . . sure. Bit played out, though, don't you think? What of your time with Edric? Any
		  lovers? What about adventures?"
		 "Lovers. . . aren't really Edric's thing. But, adventures? Sure! Why, early after his
		  ascension, he and his Brotherhood fought another god, destroying him with a Sphere of
		  Annihilation!"
		-They spent some time writing that down, then turned back to me, asking if I had any
		 adventures of my own to report.
		-"Tons! We've fought dinosaurs, undead dinosaurs, octopuses, octopus demons. . . all sorts
		  of stuff!" I replied. "How much time do you have?"
		-One of them consulted a _very_ elaborate watch, muttering something about time getting
 		 awfully complicated when you travel the planes, before calling out, "6 points."
		 "Perfect!" I replied, without missing a beat. "Then you have time for my greatest triumph,
		  at least: the recent court case!"
		-I then went into how I was terribly wronged, how Maya's friendship with Bahamut enabled our
		 appeal to the court, and how my many cunning strategems won the day.
		-Eventually, the one with the watch cut me off saying, "I think that's enough for now"
		-"Here's my card," another said, handing it to me, and than all three of them disappeared
		 in a flash of light.
		-"Let me see that card," Jade said, taking it form my hands.
			-After examining it a moment, she pronounced it a plane shift scroll, targeted to a
			 specific plane, a place she said was a kind of news room?
			 "Ah! So I'm set up for whenever I want to retire to a career of punditry, then?
			  Excellent!" I said.
		     Then, after a pause, I added, "Lots of aging pirates retire to be come news anchors.
		      Happens all the time."
	-After that, we returned to our ongoing discussion of what to do next, a thing I was rather
	 sanguine about, having just gotten the thing that I wanted.
		-We talked again about Squee's problem, inspiring me to ask, "Oh! That Sphere of Annihilation
		  The Brotherhood used. . . I wonder if that is still around, and would work?"
		-Ultimately, though, we settled on the treasure map. It sounded lot less dangerous than
		 Annihilation and such. . .  and, because, _treasure map_.
	-The one landmark on the map was the city of Graywall, a few days flight Northeast of Sharaar Kol.
	-So, we set about taking on supplies and rounding up our hung over crew members. Soon, we were
	 aloft again.
		-We opted to take more or less the shortest route. . . across the turbulent and dangerous
		 skies over the Graywall mountains.
		-That was because it was over those very same mountains, on the trip to The Shining Valley
		 and it's gnomish village, we had spied that floating platform, and Jade was still quite
		 keen on investigating it.
	-The journey was wracked by stormy weather.
		-At one point, a gnomish crewman almost went overboard, but I lassoed him with a handy line,
		 and hauled him back across the deck with help from D'Roc
	-We had a decent sense of where the platform was and, as we neared where we saw it, D'Roc
	 claimed he could _smell_ it, or at least the way it disturbed the air currents we were sailing
	 through.
		-Well, his nose didn't lead us astray, and instead _did_ lead us to the platform, sitting in
		 a volume of air the rain mysteriously did not touch.
		-On top of that, the platform was also weirder than it was before, with a series of flickering
		 images playing out across it's surface.
		-Sarge suspected an illusion, a conclusion Jade and Grimble nodded sagely in agreement with.
		-He said such things had been common in his war, as a way of concealing ships and other
		 large objects, to disguise them as wild magic.
		-We discussed poking at it in various ways: throwing something at it or shooting it with a
		 cannon, but ultimately settled on a conjured gust of wind from Sarge, as our gentlest option.
		-That may not have been our _best_ option, though, as, once Sarge finished the innvocation,
		 we all began to float, and scrambled to grab ahold of some bit of the ship.
		-Jade shouted something about it functioning as a magic inverter, rebounding magical energies
		 back at us, and we all had to wait a moment for the effect to end.
		-D'Roc then _did_ throw a rock at the. . . thing, confirming, yep, it's an illusion, but
		 Jade also claimed that it was _reacting_ to us, intelligently, and perhaps was being
		 actively controlled.
		-There was no thump or anything like that, though, that anyone heard from the rock.
		-"Well," I asked, "Who wants to go see what's inside there? Folks with wings?"
		-I got a healthy number of volunteers (well, unhealthy, given the danger involved), and
		 Bruce and Sarge were soon getting ready to fly into the illusion. Jade broke in and
		 suggested that she could make D'Roc fly with a minute's prep, and soon she was riding a
		 flying minotaur off with them as I saluted (a thing I'm not sure I _can_ do not
		 sarcastically).
	-After they were gone for roughly an hour, the illusion began to slowly move towards our ship.
		-When the lookout in the pointed that out, I sprang into action, calling out to the crew,
		 "Full speed in reverse! It's coming at us!"
		-A few minutes later though, Bruce, in the bigger-bat-thing form he often shifted into,
		 came flapping out of the illusion towards us.
		-I called out to him as he neared, saying, "What's going on? What's in there?"
		 "A ship! And it's mad captain!" Bruce shouted in reply. "He stopped time and took us
		  captive! You need to negotiate for the others' release! Slow down!"
		 "Huh. . . Sarge was right, it was hiding a ship. . . Well, trim the sails! Bring us into
		  the illusion at docking speed!" I called out to the crew.
	-As our ship passed within the illusion, I could suddenly see a gigantic ship before us.
		-It was painted with a name, The Storm's Ascent.
		-We pulled alongside it and the crew got a gangplank into position.
		-What greeted us was a warforged with eight arms, bedecked in a splendid, if tattered,
		 miltary uniform. Behind him, the away party sat in chains, all save Jade who had been
		 apparently allowed her freedom.
		-The captain greeted me and said, "Call me Red," a name his cloak indeed matched.
		 "Oh ho! Good taste!" I replied. "I'm _Fred_ the Red! Well met!"
		 Opening with an accusation, my opposite number said, "So you're the pirate."
		 "Well, don't think I've ever captured a ship. . . not that I'd turn another one down mind
		  you. But I'm forever getting called all sorts of names. . ."
		 "They called _me_ a traitor," the warforged mumbled darkly. "Couldn't in good conscious do
		  what they asked me too. . ."
		 "I know a thing or two about that!" I commiserated. "The god that sent me out on a scouting
		  mission with my first ship, he's a dick! Why he kidnapped my gnome and dared to. . . But,
		  trauma stories are best told over drinks!
		 "Grimble!" I called to my fairly fey friend. "I still haven't seen Lucien for a bit. . .
		  but do you think he's got a bottle of that Abyssal Temptation below decks? See if you can
		  find one!"
		 Turning back to the captain, I said, "You'll love the stuff! It's imported!"
		-The captain then went back to babbling about the assassins that doubtlessly had been sent
		 after him and other such ancient history while Grimble went off in search of a bottle.
		-A short while later, Grimble returned with one of the distinctive bottles and handed it to
		 the captain.
		-He uncorked it and then paused. Perhaps thinking of those assasins, he turned to Sarge and
		 said, "You first."
		-Sarge nodded and, taking the bottle in one manacled hand, took a swig and, with a look of
		 concentration on his face, managed to show no outward signs of the liquors more unusual
		 effects.
		-Satisfied, the captain took his own drink, and soon was yelling at tiny figures on his
		 shoulders. . . a thing actually rather in keeping with the rest of his behavior thus far.
		-I took the opportunity to quickly draw my rapier and stab the captain in the gap between
		 two of the plates that made up his outer carapace.
		-D'Roc and Sarge were quick to join my attack, with Sarge blasting the madman with a magic
		 shout while D'Roc wrapped his chains around the captain's neck and tried to strangle him.
		-Soon, the captain dropped lifeless to the deck. . . but, as he did, a steady beeping began
		 to come from somewhere within the ship.
		-Jade looked alarmed. Well, we all did, but her especially, and she ran off in the direction
		 of the ship's helm.
		-I began to edge my way over to the gangplank and when, after a minute or so, the beeping
		 stopped and the ship began to instead list sharply to one side, I ran across, back to my
		 ship.
		-I was joined in that by most of the party, save D'Roc who went running after Jade.
		-I grabbed a line, tossing one end after them, and then began tying the other to my ship's
		 rail.
		-Soon, D'Roc was running back, Jade slung over one shoulder, and grabbed for the line as
		 the deck tilted faster and faster under him.
		-The crew hauled them back aboard as the other ship fell from beneath them, to a spectacular
		 crash in the mountains below.
		-We all looked over the rail at the wreckage below, most seemingly as wistful as I at the
		 loss of that beautiful warship.
		-Jade immediately began to talk of salvaging the thing, and Sarge had apparently been wise
		 enough to do some salvaging on the way out, presenting her with a wand he'd taken from the
		 fallen mad-captain.
		-After some extensive study, and consulting with Sarge, Jade pronounced it the warship's
		 control rod, and also a Wand of Command in it's own right.
		-She remained very much intent on salvaging what we could form the ship, despite the
		 mountainous terrain it's wreckage was spread across, and I was all for it, thinking of
		 how it's artifice could be repurposed for our own ship.


10/28/24:
	-Intent on that salvage, we brought the ship down lower, over the crashsite.
		-The winds grew stronger and more turbulent nearer the mountains, so I was busy barking
		 orders as the crew rushed all over the place, trying to keep the ship under control.
		-The wreckage was. . . flickering. Strangely.
			-Jade deemed it some kind of arcane energy, suggesting it was perhaps coming from the
			 warship's engines.
		-There was no surface suitable for actually _landing_ our ship, so, once we neared the
		 crashsite, we lowered ropes and climbed down.
	-Once on the mountainside, we sought a way up the sharp slope.
		-We pooled our ropes and climbing gear, giving charge of them to Sarge, who apparently
		 wore dragon-themed boots with a climbing effect.
		-He scurried up the snowy slope, and _attempted_ to anchor the ropes to the mountainside,
		 for the rest of us to climb up, but they came undone with the slightest tug.
			-Can't _believe_ he used to serve aboard ships. . .
		-Jade solved the issue, though, by granting a similar spell effect to D'Roc, who then
		 _carried_ most of us up the steep slope, his feet (Hooves? What's inside those boots?)
		 glued to the mountain by magic.
		-Part way up, though, Lucien called out from where he hung from D'Roc's back, saying, "Look!
		  There's something moving in the snow!"
		-We followed his pointing, seeing large, shadowy figures approaching through the snow
		 flurries.
		-Any illusion that they came in peace was quickly shattered by the howling of wolves.
		-Moments later, as they approached through the snow, the figures revealed themselves to be
		 a band of various giants, preceded by several large, white wolves. . . 
		-. . . and Lucien, with haste-enhanced speed, rushed towards them himself, cutting down the
		 leading wolf.
		-With that, the battle was joined, with us hurling spells down the slope while the giants
		 hurled rocks upward.
		-For our part, Grimble conjured an illusory white dragon, bursting from "beneath" the snow,
		 roaring and snapping, while I stared down the biggest frost giant, their apparent leader,
		 and locked his brain.
			-The wolves, and a couple of the giants, ran in fear of the gargantuan dragon while
			 their leader stared blankly ahead.
			-With that accomplished, the two of us wisely sought some cover to hide behind.
		-Sarge's conjured bursts of flames proved devestatingly effective, but one of the frost
		 giants managed to tackle Lucien, and he fell in the snow, wrestling with his enormous
		 opponent.
		-D'Roc, nearly the size of the giant, came to Lucien's rescue, running at them and slamming
		 into the giant, pushing the giant off Lucien and goring the huge humanoid with his horns.
		-One of the giants hit Maya with a thrown boulder, staggering her and nearly knocking her
		 off her feet.
			-In response she turned to the giant and stared him down. I think she may have been
			 casting some spell but, if so, I did not see what it did. The giant, in any event
			 seemed unphased.
		-Eventually, the series of spells hurled at his vicinity incinerated the stupified leader
		 of the giants (along with any pretense Grimble's dragon was real), freeing Grimble and I
		 to focus on other things.
			-I used that opportunity to take careful aim at the nearest giant and, popping up from
			 my cover, lodged an arrow between his ribs, before ducking back down.
			-Grimble made to follow my example, holding his crossbow and beginning to stand up, but
			 I yanked him back down, saying, "Hey. You already basically died once. Don't be so
			  eager for a repeat performance."
		-The fight wore on and, though mostly one sided, even formidble D'Roc fell for a bit beneath
		 a giant's fierce blows, but he was soon back on his feet, some of his wounds healed by a
		 potion flown over by Maya's familiar.
		-Eventually, the remaining couple of giants turned to flee, though that didn't stop me from
		 loosing more arrows after them.
			-I'm not above shooting a man in the back.
	-After the fight, we searched through the bodies of the giants.
		-More salvage. . .
		-Sadly, the weapons of the frost giants turned out to be made of ice, pretty much ruling
		 out any resale value.
		-Their leader had a sweet magic belt, though, and they had a fair amount of coin between
		 them.
	-Returning to the climb, we reached the wreckage of the warship a short while later.
		-Peering through a rent in the ship's mangled hull, we could see the ship's engines. . .
		 which were surrounded by a continuous lightshow of arcing energies.
		-At our urging, Jade stepped forward to examine the matter more closely, but jumped back as
		 an arc of energy caught her foot.
			-The wound, rather than the burn we expected, was more of a. . . blackening, necrotic
			 affair, suggesting the energy was not simply lightning.
		-Maya, ever the historian, was excited that the aft of the ship was most intact.
			-She mentioned she hoped there might be log books and the like, discussing the ship's
			 service and travels.
			-Well, I _was_ rather fond of the color of the captain's wardrobe. . .
			-Maya then clarified her intentions, suggesting that the log books may disclose the
			 location of old _armories_, from the war, thing perhaps stocked with ship parts and
			 the like.
			-_That_ had me rubbing my hands. . .
		-"Oh!" I then blurted out. "Maya's mention of the captain reminds me of something! Didn't
		  Sarge grab some kind of control device for the ship? That wand-like thing? Maybe it can
		  be used to control the engines?
		-My suggestion unsurprisingly proved brilliant and, drawing out the wand, Jade fiddled with
		 if for a bit and was eventually able to stop the arcing energies.

		-So, get it done!


11/11/24:
	-"Is that thing safe to approach now, Jade?" I asked.
	 "Uh. . . I think so?"
	 "Great! We've got a rescue to do! The air elementals that powered this ship, they've been
	  trapped, what, decades?"
		-I then called out in Auran, "Hello?"
		-But, if I got any reply, well, we were on a windswept mountainside and the language sounds
		 like wind in the first place.
	-It seemed like we needed to get closer, so Jade and Maya discussed some options and settled on
	 what turned out to be a _quite_ impressive Lute (of Building) solo, substantially repairing the
	 damaged, and previously shakey, wreckage.
	-In response, though, flashing arcs of lightning again began to dance over the ship's hull and
	 engines.
		-In fact, the patterns. . . seemed less than random.
		-Our arcanists fell to discussing the matter.
			-They concluded that these _were_ the elementals that had been powering the ship, but
			 that they were also somehow supercharged.
			-They discussed a plane of origin that had greater levels of elemental energy, as well
			 some arcane transformation process, one related to dragons, and perhaps the process
			 that _made_ Sarge something dragon-like.
			-In any event, the lute's magic seemed to have pacified them somewhat.
		-"So, these are the elementals then?" I asked and, seeing more nods than shrugs, I called
		 again to the dancing arcs in Auran, saying, "Hey there!"
		-The lightening arcs continued their dance, but it _changed_. It was a response.
		-Maya's a dancer to rival even I, and is perhaps somewhat bolder than me (probably due to
		 her gentler upbringing), so she was quick to follow their lead and engage in a kind of
		 _interpretive_ dance, questioning them, after a fashion, about their nature.
		-They responded with images of dragons imbuing something (them?) with lightning energy,
		 only for that all to be stuffed into some kind of device.
			-We also got a scene of warforged marching off to, well, war.
			-Maya recognized the banner in that scene, that of House Deneith, one of the ruling
			 houses of Khorvaire, people known to consort with The Cult of the Dragon Below.
				-Their banner bore a lion, a dragon, and a minotaur.
		-"These Deneith pricks are the ones who bound you to this engine, huh?" I asked the
		 arcing elementals.
			-By way of response, the arcs formed a giant face, which then nodded.
		-"Jerk move," I sympathized. "But, how did you like the sailing life?"
			-This time, we got a whole saga.
			-Their arcs formed a globe, featuring a supercontinent one that, as we watched, was
			 shattered by a great hammer, with the pieces drifting into the shapes of continents
			 we know today.
			-Then, we got to watch a series of battles, nations rising and falling, and great
			 catastophes, all playing out in miniature across the globes surface.
				-I actually learned quite a lot. This electric play was a lot more exciting than
				 history class (everyone got a +5 to Knowledge(History)).
			-With that, they managed to also convey that they had been around for a _long_ time,
			 involved with airships for much of it.
		-"OK, so, _dedicated_ sailors, huh? Me too! You know, we're always looking for experienced
		  crew. . . Our elementals serve freely too. None of this bound to the engines shit. . .
		  You'll love Patches and Peggy! Just watch out when Peggy starts swinging that wooden leg
		  around. At least I _think_ it's a leg. . ."
			-That triggered another show, the globe shrinking, or us receding from it, and then up,
			 past other globes, until all that was contained in one great crystal sphere which was,
			 in turn, soon one tiny crystal sphere among many, pouring through a great hour glass.
			-The more studious among us mumbled about a multi-verse, planes upon planes separated
			 into different spheres.
			-The elementals clearly yearned for other spheres, conveying a desire to leave this one
			 that they'd resided for so long within.
			-Jade even thought that travel between such things was one of the capabilities of this
			 ships wonderous engine, though the damage to it prevented that until substantial
			 repairs were done.
				-"Well, the ability to run _even farther_ away from some folks in my life would be
				  pretty welcome. . ." I responded.
	-Well, with all this interest in a "spelljammer drive", we fell to discussing how we could
	 continue our efforts to salvage the ship.
		-The engine was _immense_. It alone would never fit in our hold.
			-It's 125' x 25' x 15'.
		-So, we started talking about whether we could build some kind of frame we could lift with
		 our ship, perhaps from the warship's remains.
		-Or perhaps we should fortify _this_ area, and create some shelter from the elements, to
		 undertake some serious work on site?
	-With the salvage details still under debate, we figured we should also search through the
	 rest of the before making an final decisions.
		-We turned up some coins and some expensive-looking artworks.
		-It was the captain's quarters that proved especially interesting.
			-There, Maya's eyes alighted upon an especially fine pair of boots, but, when she
			 reached out to touch them, they teleported across the room. . . and began to talk.
			-In the tones of an old sailor, the boots inquired after their captain, and we had to
			 break the news about the long isolation and undeniable madness of the warforged skipper
			 that I stabbed, and his scuttling of the warship.
				-(I glossed over the stabbing bit.)
				-It took some doing, but the boots were eventually persuaded of the captain's
				 madness, especially after they got a sense of how long it had been.
					-They seemed especially hurt that the captain hadn't called on his "first mate"
					 in that time.
				-I saw no reason to mention the stabbing bit.
				-They introduced themselves as Jaspar.
					-"Ah! On account of the brown leather, eh?" I responded. "I like a good
					  wardrobe-and-name theme. . ."
				-When the boots proposed a drinking contest to determine who was the captain now,
				 I knew they were my kind of people. . . er, footwear.
				-I eagerly accepted, and the boots designated D'Roc the referee.
				-"3, 2, GO!" I called out, hoisting the rum bottle I was given to my lips.
				-The boots laces pulled their own bottle over, tipping it into one of the shoes.
				-D'Roc soon called the boots out, for the splashing of liquid he could hear on the
				 other side of the cabin door.
					-"What? It's no different than it going down his stomach. . ." the boots groused
					 as I seized the distraction to keep drinking and try to pull ahead.
					-That shit stopped soon enough anyways, the boots perhaps out of charges, and
					 the voice emanating from the boot without a bottle stuck in it began to slur.
				-I had to lean on my mental powers to push myself to keep rushing towards alcohol
				 poisoning, but also noticed my bottle was not emptying it as it should, it being
				 seemingly endless, and perhaps another trick.
				-I'm fuzzy on what happened from there, but clearly I won by disqualification,
				 having at least cheated far less _visibly_ (if my inborn powers are even cheating).
	-The rest of what I remember from the night was trying to sleep beneath a moth-eaten blanket
	 (which smelled of vomit for some reason) while the sounds of music and construction _both_ JUST
	 WOULD NOT KNOCK IT OFF!


TODO:
	-(Done!) Remove Mage Armor from Grimble!
	-(Done!) See who those boots would like to travel with, or where else they'd go?
		-Given that their intelligent, you don't feel any better about treating them like property
		 than with the elementals.


12/16/24:
	-When I could no longer manage more of anything resembling sleep, I got up, wiped off some mess,
	 and stumbled forth, pulling on my new friend Jaspar as I did so.
		-I did _ask_ first:
			"So, Jaspar. . . that rum last night, that felt like the origin of a friendship to me,
			 right? In light of that, mind if I, uh. . . put my feet inside you?"
			". . . I've never been asked quite like that before. . . Well, what's the hygiene
			 situation? Do you powder?"
			"Hmm. . . the inside of you sure smells like rum at the moment. . . and so do I. Guess
			 we can't make it worse?"
	-My crew had been busy in my absence (of consciousness), and I found the wreckage surrounded by
	 a formidable stone wall, the wall itself camouflaged with snow piled against it.
	-I didn't have much time to admire the work, though, as Lucien reported seeing, down the
	 mountain, the glint of what he thought might be a spyglass.
		-Peering down the mountain some more, Lucien thought he might have seen something he termed
		 a "githyanki", some kind of humanoid from the Astral Plane.
			-Well, maybe not originally, Jade clarified. She infact had heard rumors of them being
			 sited around crash sites and natural disasters lately too. . .
		-We talked about talking it out, but, if they're interested in crash sites, well, this one
		 is ours and I sure as the hells ain't giving it up.
		-So, that left intimidation and worse.
		-With them not attacking quite _yet_, we had options to prepare.
			-Maya through out enlisiting gravity to our cause, causing an avalanche or the like.
			-I also asked Jade, "Jade, is any of the ship's artillery still in shape? Or easily
			  repaired? That'd offer the possibility of an avalanche _or_ more direct action. . ."
				-She and Sarge fell to discussing the matter, and seemed confident they could get
				 something working.
		-While we prepped, Lucien pointed out something else alarming: the sun seemed to be getting
		 _dramatically_ brighter, to a degree that, now that he pointed it out, must clearly be
		 unnatural.
			-There goes our snow cover, then, and maybe more badness besides.
		-We debated more prep, but then Lucien blurted out, ". . . someone just tried to banish me."
			-"Jade," I asked, "What's the range on that? Are they already here?"
			 ". . . It's close," she confirmed.
			 "Shit. They're here!"
		-We began to cast our eyes about, Lucien spotted a humanoid creeping up, brandishing a holy
		 symbol.
		-Lucien _also_ put together the sun, the holy symbol, and, now that he mentioned it, the
		 feint whiff of garlic and ran after the humanoid (who turned and fled) yelling, "I'm not a
		 vampire, damn it!"
			-Lucien easily caught up, and started a discussion I was a bit far to hear.
		-After a short conversation, the humanoid disappeared, and Lucien returned.
			-He summarized the conversation saying, yeah, it thought he was a vampire, and was
			 worried about the "planar technology" of the wreckage falling into the hands of. . .
			 someone, and their airship armada.
		-Well, while I was still in favor of our artillery as the solution, but there _was_ more we
		 could learn here.
			-I checked with Jaspar, and, indeed, as he had demonstrated when cheating during our
			 rum drinking contest, he could teleport stuff, and said his limit would be three of us.
			-So, we put together an away party of Lucien, Grimble, and myself.
			-We made no effort to conceal ourselves, since this was a parlay, but _did_ do the most
			 intimidating walk we could manage, which was quite scary, between Lucien and I.
			-As we neared the camp, we hailed them, and a representative came out to talk.
				-"You walk like warriors, not just treasure hunters as we'd expected," the gleaming-
				 armored and green-skinned humanoid said to us by way of greeting. "We did not wish
				  the ship's technology to fall into the wrong hands."
				 "It _is_ quite the treasure," I replied, "But not something we're going to treat
				  lightly. . . or give up lightly. You seem worried about some third party, though.
				  I'd like to learn more about that. . ."
				 "Do any of you have magic in your blood?" the creature then asked.
				-We had looked one to another, the wizard, the planar half-breed, and the whatever
				 I am, and then asked a bunch of clarifying questions.
					-Ultimately, it seemed like his main concern was _sorcerors_. At least Lucien
					 _kind of_ counted, but was less _refined_ than what he said his foe sought.
					-We pointedly _did not_ mention Sarge. . . but should warn him.
				-The githyanki then recommended that, if we employed the ship we were salvaging, we
				 would need protection, and offered that of the Githyanki Empire, but would be said
				 that we would then besubject to the Lich Queen's orders.
				-Changing the subject, I then asked, "Well, can you put a name to this blood
				  drinking nightmare you're concerned about?"
					-"I'm not sure it can be translated. . ." he warned and, indeed the Astral
					 gibberish he then uttered was unintelligible to the three of us.
					-He did, though, speak of entire planes stripped of their blood, saying they
					 seem to be collecting it. . .
				-"Well. . . we're normally freebooters," I began, returning to his offer, "But, if
				  we do seek protection, how do we get in contact?"
					-"Who is your communications officer?" he asked, and we eventually clarified
					 that we would need someone to cast Sending.
					-I said that was well within our abilities and asked his name, which he gave as
					 "R'san".
				-We then took our leave and returned to the ship (on foot, since it wasn't an
				 emergency, tempted though I was to do otherwise, given the slope).
	-By the time we got back to the ship, Maya's Lyre strumming had essentially all the non-magical
	 portions of the warship repaired.


TODO:
	-(Done!) Remove Mage Armor from Grimble!

1/6/25:
	-Despite the new revelations about the hazards of traveling between multiverses / crystal
	 spheres / whatever, we were still intent on it after some discussion.
		-Jade _did_ warn us, though, that we had no navigation system for this.
	-So, our course decided, we set about salvaging that engine.
		-D'Roc began hacking away at the structure of the ship, to free the engine.
		-Meanwhile, Maya, with her lyre, played and built a frame to lift the engine with our own
		 shift.
		-Despite my expert guidance, our ship strained to lift the salvaged equipment from the
		 warship's wreckage.
		-Sarge volunteered overcharging the elementals of our own ship's engine again, but,
		 remembering the damage that did to our last ship, I suggested instead the help of our new
		 dragon-lightning elemental friends, invested as they are in the project of getting this
		 engine back together.
		-Consulting Jade, yeah, she thought they might be able to provide some additional oomph for
		 our engine, so they joined our existing air elementals in their labor.
	-But, of course, something went wrong. . .
		-Those lightning elementals added their effort by manipulating the _salvaged_ engine, now
		 at least tied to our existing ship. . . 
		-. . . and, in a flash, we, our ship, and all found ourselves in a vast, gray expanse.
		-That caused some alarm, but thankfully Jade recognized it as The Astral Plane.
		-"Well," I said, "I guess that's more or less what these new engines are supposed to do. . .
		  So, I guess this is kind of a step in the right direction. Jade! What do you need to
		  fully repair these things?"
		-"Time," she replied, but also apparently some supplies, so despite that crystal's mostly
		 endless supply of time, we needed to find something that wasn't gray nothingness.
			-"Well, can you at least get us back to The Material Plane?" I asked her.
			 "I can get _us_ back. . . but not the ship," she replied.
			 "Ah. It _is_ rather dear to me," I said. "The engines are _supposed_ to do that for
			  us. What do you need to get that working, Jade?"
			 "This is the plane of transit. . . Maybe something native to The Astral can help?"
		-So, we set about searching for. . . well, anything, in this vast expanse.
			-Jade offered the intriguing observation that Bag of Holding are actually backed by
			 small, folded pockets of The Astral Plane.
				-". . . does that mean we can _pick_ those pockets?" I asked.
				 "Well. . . maybe?" she replied. "First you'd have to _find_ them and, well, The
				  Astral is _infinite_."
			-Maya volunteered that dragons can (probably) smell gold, and consulted her familiar.
				-Sniffing about, Paziameira the tiny dragon said, "Huh. . . I do detect a faint
				  whiff of silver?"
		-That was good enough for me, so Paziameira pointed us in the direction and away the ship
		 sailed.
	-After we traveled. . . some(?) distance, we could see a gray, smokey fog, on the horizon.
		-As we got nearer, several of us took a look at it through the spyglass, and Maya noted
		 that it appeared to have a humanoid shape, and wore two silver bracelets that were
		 presumably what Paziameira had smelled.
		-"Well, I know Auran and, smoke-man, so I figure Auran or Ignan are both good bets," I
		 volunteered.
		-So I hailed the. . . whatever, calling out, "Ho there! We're a bit lost. . . Mind if we
		  ask for directions?"
		-In response, the smoke-thing disappeared, and suddenly appeared aboard our ship, towering
		 over even D'Roc.
		-I quickly stepped forward to great the. . . whatever, saying, "Hi! Fred the Red here! It's
		  a pleasure to meet you! We wanted to. . . Wait where are my manners?!? Would you like
		  something to drink?"
		-"Well, of course!" the fog bank answered, and conjured a pair of whiskey glasses
		 "Nice trick!" I complemented the cloud. "I've got a trick of my own: endless rum! Good
		  thing too, as you're a big one! Tell me when!"
		-The necessary addressed and drinks in hand, the foggy figure introduced himself as "The
		 Great Wizard Martek" and, as we got to small talk, he asked, "What year is it?"
		 "That depends on where you're from," Maya chimed in.
		 "That it does!" the being replied. "Where are you from?"
		 "We're recently arrived from The Material!" I supplied. "We were messing about with a
		  magical artifact, one thing led to another, and suddenly we're on The Astral Plane. You
		  know how it is, seeing as you're a wizard and all. . .
		 "Indeed I do!" Martek agreed. "Well, it's been some time since last I was there. . . Tell
		  me, do the giants still rule the place?"
		-Not as far as we were aware, so we informed him as much, to his apparent delight, as
		 apparently it was the giants that exiled him to The Astral, long ago.
		-He then asked if we wouldn't happen to have a giant skull by any chance.
			-Maya offered a giant dragon skull (apparently we kept one), proposing exchanging it
			 for his bracelets.
			-Though he commented that such things have power, he wasn't much interested.
			-As he explained, he needed the skull of a giant descended from those that banished him
			 to be able to return to The Material Plane.
			-Nonetheless, Maya tried to sell him on the skull anyways, offering to throw in the
			 celebrated Flumph's Blue Salt ("Great wizard already, it'll make you a great _chef_
			 too!" I added) and, when that was not enough, some soup.
				-"Can I try the soup?" the wizard asked, leading to some cooking on Maya's part,
				 with flumph-provided mushrooms, flame from Paziameira, vegetable slicing from
				 Lucien, and, of course the blue salt.
				-Tasting it, Martek pronounced it good. . . but still wasn't going to be parting
				 with those bracelets.
			-Well, if it's a particular flavor of giant skull he's dead set on, we could certainly
			 keep our eyes out once we found our way back to The Material.
				-Maya thought to inquire, "If we _can_ obtain one, how would we find you?"
				-By way of answer, he gave us a _different_ bracelet, from which dangled four
				 charms. He touched one, which turned a smokey gray, and said that it could be used
				 to call him to us from any point on The Astral Plane.
		-Maya then suggested pancakes, to follow the soup, which we all enthusiastically agreed to.
			-That enthusiasm was somewhat dampered when she suggested that they'd be mushroom
			 pancakes, but we didn't let that entirely deter us.
			-"Grimble!" I called out. "You're an alchemist! Think you could make a syrup from rum?"
				-He did indeed, to much delight.
		-Through out most of this, with only the occasional pancake break, Jade worked on the
		 engines, using that time crystal.
			-Ducking down to where she was doing so, we saw. . . multi-Jade: a flurry of Jades
			 rushing about and working on various portions of the project.
			-Maya tried to touch one, but it was like trying to grasp one of Grimble's illusions,
			 despite the physical progress she was making.
		-Well, leaving Jade to that, we returned to the deck, where Martek was still (somewhat
		 confusingly, given his semi-substantial form) eating pancakes.
		-Eventually, we discussed seeking the aid of the Githyanki, there being a standing offer
		 there, they being (sort of) native to the plane, and they being familiar with the engine
		 technology.
		-Martek knew the way to their Lich Queen and, with some arcane gestures, conjured some form
		 of navigation system for us, with only one set of coordinates within.
	-Saying our goodbyes to Martek, we sailed there and found a floating city of many towers.
		-As we neared the the ring of airships circling structure, I was subjected to a horrid voice
		 ringing in my mind, barking, "Surrender and prepare to be boarded!"
			-"Well, they're hailing us, folks," I relayed to my crew. "Stand down and prepare to
			  greet the welcomong party.
		-One of their ship pulled alongside us and a githyanki sailor called over, "If you come to
		  do hommage to our queen, those pathetic iron tubes you call weaponry disgrace you!"
		 "I have weapons," Maya replied, pointing to D'Roc and Sarge.
		-Lucien looked terribly insulted to not be included and, puffing up his chest, yelled, "Send
		  your fiercest warrior over and I'll show you what I can do! Face me in a duel!"
	-The githyanki took up Lucien's challenge, and sent over their champion.
		-What ensued alternated between a blur of swords and shouted insults.
		-Lucien drew first blood, though, and made the impression we were looking for.
		-Their champion _did_ go out of his way to insult my ship, though. . .
	-We were directed to a dock low on the structure and, as we disembarked, we found ourselves at
	 the base of a _looong_ staircase.
		-Another insult. . .
		-The short trip to the dock, we were also shadowed by a colossal red dragon.
			-So, hooray, a show of power too. I like these jackasses about as well as I do Edric.
	-Well, after an interminable climb, we were led to the Lich Queen's throne room.
		-Her intimidating decore and wardrobe made quite the impression. Enough of an impression,
		 in fact that D'Roc spun on his hooves and ran back down the stairs, with Maya quickly joining
		 him.
		-I myself was struck (nearly) speechless.
		-The queen was big on oaths of service, a thing she was eager to push on the lot of us.
			-Lucien especially.
		-Fortunately, Lucien had thoughts. . .
			-He and our wrinkly queen here had an overlap of interests: an enimity with Lucien's
			 angelic kin.
			-There was a lot of wrangling, but he managed to sell her on the head of one of his more
			 famous kin in return for her aid getting back to The Material.
				-Definitely a win-win, as Lucien later explained that, though she's his grandmother,
				 she also orchestrated the deaths of his parents.
			-The Lich Queen _did_ set a deadline, though: within a week.
	-So, we returned to the ship and delivered the news to the others, with a decidedly mixed
	 reception.
		-Apparently some of the others are a bit more tolerant of self-righteous celestials than I.


2/10/25:
	-"What do you lot drink around here?" I asked the first githyanki I encountered outside the
	 throneroom.
	 "Well, that depends. Are you drinking to get drunk, or before battle?" he replied.
	 "Yes! . . . you know how it is: one thing tends to lead to another. . ."
		-The gith took us to a bar within their astral city, and introduced me to something called
		 "Starforged Mead".
		-Taking a swig from the bottle of sparkling liquid, it was deliciously sweet and, weirdly,
		 left me feeling. . . focused?
		-"See! I told them I should be able to drink in class. . ." I exclaimed. "Shit, my shoes
		  have to try this," I added, as I poured some down my ankle.
		-It seemed for a moment I'd offended our host, until my boots spoke up saying, "Yeah, that
		 is damned good!"
		-"Do you still have your uncle around here somewhere?" D'Roc asked.
		 "Oh! Yeah, Uncle Rov would definitely enjoy some too. . ." I replied, and then began
		 rifling through my pack. "Bottle of rum. . . empty bottle of rum. . . Ah! Bottle of uncle!"
		-The Rov-slime too got a pour, and briefly developed a set of star-like white dots. He then
		 pronounced his approval by shaping his slime-self into a thumbs up.
	-Impressed thus far, I asked the bartender what else was on the menu.
		-He asked me whether I was looking for something basic or more exotic and I claimed
		 "cosmopolitan tastes", so he offered me a silver, swirling liquid that he claimed had been
		 distilled from the essence of the Astral Plane itself.
		-I downed a dram of the quicksilver concoction and. . . found myself elsewhere.
			-I sat in something like the classrooms of my childhood in the creche, but decorated
			 with illustrations of happy animals and the like, rather than the gray, utilitarian
			 spaces I recalled.
			-It was like I drank to forget my childhood, and instead found a better one. . .
		-"Shit, guys! You've got to try this!" I said, as I bought a round for the rest.
		-I watched most of my fellows have a glass each, then each zone out for a minute or two.
	-That eventually led to some philosophical discussions with our gith guide.
		-Talking about how long we'd had our ship led to our dragon encounters, which led to the
		 githyanki alliance with the dragon god Tiamat (and some choking, then heming and hawing
		 from Maya).
		-Eventually, though, we seem to have managed to thoroughly weird out our host, who took his
		 leave of us.
	-That then left us to discuss our next move.
		-We settled on learning a bit more about Lucien's grandmother. He himself had peeled off at
		 some point on the way to the bar, so we eventually caroused our way back to the ship.
		-Lucien had beaten us there apparently, and we could hear him in his cabin sharpening his
		 sword and muttering. . . We opted to leave him be for the moment.
		-After some discussion, we decided to visit her homeplane, Aborea, and do some homework.
			-Jade claimed the Celestials operate some form of Internal Affairs service, and, if
			 Lucien's grandmother is as dirty as he says, they probably have some dirt on her.
			-Through some mix of planar knowledge and our ship's new navigation equipment, the
			 scholars and arcanists among us were able to identify a city on Aborea that we could
			 travel to, one large enough that it should offer us opportunities to investigate.
			-We did decide it would be better to arrive outsided the city and make a subtle approach,
			 as opposed to appearing in the air above it in the airship.
	-We returned to our ship, and soon shifted to Aborea.
		-We appeared hovering alongside a cliff some distance from the city, with a dense canopy
		 of trees far below us, startling some deer as we emerged from our ship.
		-That actually prompted Grimble to offer a suggestion, and soon he was fluttering after the
		 deer, aloft on his butterfly wings.
		-They seeemed rather less alarmed by him flying than us stomping, and soon he was conversing
		 with them in a simple language known to his forest-dwelling people, one with which they
		 could communicate with creatures of the forest. In short order, he had them eating bits of
		 rations from his hand.
		-They informed him of both ways down to the forest below, and also dangers.
			-To the North, a winding slope led downward, but they'd also seen a lion?
			-A nearby cave led down more quickly, and had tasty food, but also smelled of a nest?
		-We opted for the Northern route, and set out.
	-As we walked on through the wilderness (a weirdly diverse wilderness, with different
	 environments abutting one another, desert next to jungle, far more abruptly than we'd see on
	 The Material Plane), Bruce called attention to the fact that we were being hunted.
		-After a whispered conference, D'Roc, with my advice, attempted to lead us to a place that
		 would trick our pursuer into revealing himself.
		-That. . . did not work. We did a fancy loop around a big tree at the center of a clearing,
		 but instead of revealing our pursuer, that led to a bolas flying out of some nearby
		 vegetation.
		-That led to a short scuffle with some sort of lion man.
			-We spotted him where the bolas came from, and Grimble blasted the great tree, causing
			 it to crash down between the us and him, before darting behind some rocks.
				-Or, as it turned out (and we saw once he dispelled it), created the illusion of
				 all that happening!
			-I darted for cover myself as I cast my mind forward in the future to anticipate the
			 threat.
			-The others similarly took up defensive positions as a lion-man hybrid emerged from
			 the vegetation. . . and let loose a painful, deafening roar.
			-Bruce conjured a ramp of stone up to the embankment on which the lion man stood and
			 D'Roc ran up it shouting threats.
			-The lion man then dived back into the vegetation, but Sarge drove him back out by
			 blasting the area with a ball of fire.
			-I'd been waiting for his reappearance, though, and, catching sight of him again,
			 focused my mind on him and soft-locked his brain, leaving him at our mercy for as long
			 as we wanted.
		-My mental powers left the creature helpless, but also me less than helpful and him unable
		 to speak, so our next order of business was to secure him in a different manner.
		-Ultimately we settled on encasing him in salt, conjured by Bruce, and having D'Roc standby
		 with his axe.
		-I then released his mind and, after some momentary disorientation, he (the mane made it
		 plenty clear) was demanding his release.
			-We eventually calmed him down a bit and he explained that he'd been hunting the deer
			 when our airship's arrival scared them off, so he decided to hunt us instead. . . though
			 he swore he only wanted to talk. . .
			-"You're supposed to open with a 'Hello' or 'How are you doing?'. Not a bolas from the
			  bushes!" I repremanded him. "I should know! I'm an expert diplomat!"
			-Well, I did go on to admit I understood being hangry and that, though my rations were
			 mostly hardtack and similarly awful shit, I did have some rum!
				-He seemed unfamiliar with the concept!
				-He asked if this beverage came from a stream or pool or. . .
				 "It come from sugar cane!" I explained.
				 "And this 'sugar cane' was defeated in glorious combat?"
				 "Well, I do think there's some beating of the cane involved. . ." I said. "And
				  distilling! Here. . . let me pour you a glass."
				-He gulped down his dram and, coughing and sputtering, shouted, "Gods! The stuff is
				  awful!"
				 "Well, it _does_ fight back. . ." I offered.
				 "Still. . ." he went on. "It does seem to have a rather pleasing effect on
				  oneself. . ."
				 "That it does! Here, have another. . ."
			-Soon, we were on much friendlier terms, and had learned his name was Kaelith.
			-We explained were were here seeking the nearby city, come to visit some kin of a friend
			 of ours.
				-"Oh! So he's a Celestial?" Kaelith asked.
				 "His ancestry comes from all over the place," I allowed.
				 "Where is this friend?"
				 "Back at our ship," D'Roc offered. "Preparing. . . a gift for his grandmother."
				 "So. . . you're some kind of scouting party?" the lion man asked.
				 "You could say that," I said. "Sometimes you have to flush out your quarry after
				  all. . ."
			-He offered to lead us to the city, which he named Canopy's Reach, though his finger
			 wouldn't hold quite steady when he tried to point in it's direction.
	-His intoxication aside, we followed our erstwhile pursuer to where he said the city lay.
		-Eventually, the sunlight dimmed and we made camp for the evening, Kaelith, D'Roc, and Bruce
		 constructing a campsite and improvised shelters for us all.


2/24/25:
	-Lucien caught up with us as we were drinking around the campfire, to some alarm on Kaelith's
	 part at our horned companion emerging from the darkness.
		-We calmed him down, though, letting him know Lucien was another of our companions.
		-More drinking ensued. . .
	-Come morning, we continued on to the city.
		-Conversationally, Kaelith asked us if we thought they'd let us through the city's walls.
		 "Well, I did until now," I responded.
		-Nonetheless, we continued on, until the city's enormous stone walls were in sight.
		-At which point, Kaelith said he'd made good on his word, as indeed he had, and asked for
		 a parting gift of rum, brandishing an empty waterskin.
		 "Just say when!" I happily replied, filling the bottle to overflowing, luxuriating in my
		 infinite rum, until he actually did.
	-No one greeted us at the gate, but D'Roc banging away at the thing sorted that.
		-After an exchange of "Who goes there?!?" and what not, we got to explaining that we were
		 here in search of our friend's long lost kin.
		-The gate guard was quite skeptical of us, particularly eyeing Lucien's horns (and giving
		 D'Roc a great deal of offense when he said as much).
		-But, I was able to convince the guard of our good intentions, and he eventually let us
		 through the gates.
		-He _did_ though insist we check our weapons as the gate, leading to some frantic scrambling
		 to conceal blades and the like.
			-I myself happily handed over my (cheap) weapons, though I "explained" that my wands
			 were wands of, "Cure Light Wounds, Cure Moderate Scabies, Heal Some Other Stuff. . .
			 I'm a healer you see!"
	-We needed information to get more information, so we started by asking around the market.
		-"Such nice people here. . . How do you keep them so?" and similar, angling for that
		 "Internal Affairs" service we'd heard the celestials maintained.
		-Ultimately, we ended up bribing a merchant who was clearly fishing for it, and also liquored
		 him up (naturally).
		-With Lucien mentioning his grandmother's name (which I promptly forgot), the merchant was
		 indeed aware of rumors of a scandal involving a grandson. . . and also some kind of super
		 soldier program: warriors trained by air elementals or something like that, whirlwinds of
		 blades.
	-Taking our leave of our notably corrupt corruption expert, we found a bit of privacy to discuss
	 our next move.
		-Lucien was immediately thinking about how to sneak into the temple in which his grandmother
		 worked or resided or whatever.
		-I, though, proposed trying to lure her away from it somehow, some of us (here I was eying
		 D'Roc) not being the sneakiest folks in the world. . .
		-Lucien then proposed announcing his "capture", and trying to lure her back to the boat to
		 come take possession of the "prisoner".
		-I had an alternative in mind, though: quinceanera!
			-This required explaining. . .
			-Essentially, I proposed throwing some kind of party in Lucien's honor, in an effort to
			 both lure his grandmother there and provoke her.
	-Weirdly, the quinceanera thing kept snowballing. . .
		-We visited a party shop in a tree, run by fairies, to purchase streamers, cupcakes, banners
		 for confusing assortment of conflicting events, and a bunch of self-playing kazoos.
			-Sadly, Maya was not with us, as this totally would have been her kind of thing. I think
			 she was sulking a bit, due to this whole hunting angels and allying with Tiamat's allies
			 thing. . .
		-We then debated a location and, even more weirdly, I convinced myself, then the others, that
		 the ominous cave the deer were telling us about was a great location.
			-I mean, it _was_ near to both the city _and_ our ship, it was outside the city. . . and
			 it made me giggle.
		-On our way to scout the location, we also took some time to spread rumors about the upcoming
		 party:
			"It's going to be the event of the millenia. . ."
			"The Material Plane's famed Party Lizard might even make an appearance. . ."
			"You probably haven't heard about it yet. . . it's really underground."
	-So, we had D'Roc look for the end of the cave system nearest the city, a thing he did with
	 obvious ease.
		-The opening he lead us too required some sqeezing from his large form, but nonetheless he
		 lead the way. . . and called a halt just inside.
		-He and Lucien explained that the loose sand ahead of us. . . with skeletal hands poking
		 out of it. . . posed a hazard to us.
			-Duh.
		-Thankfully Grimble and Sarge were easily able to sort that, glassing the sand with a
		 judicious application of conjured flame.
		-Soon, we had a neat glass floor for the entrance, complete with spooky skeleton hands
		 underneath!
		-I found myself curious if that had drawn any attention to us and, sure enough, cocking his
		 head, D'Roc said he could hear some. . . squawking, coming from deeper in the cave.
		-Hearing that, Lucien scouted forward while Grimble and I took up defensive positions, hiding
		 behind a rock outcropping.
		-The rest of the party crept forward too, and, apparently seeing something down a hole,
		 Lucien raised his blade, ready to attack it, while Sarge blasted the ceiling above the hole,
		 dropping rocks down it to much further squawking.
		-Soon, some kind of bird-horse emerged from a different hole.
		-Grimble blasted it with a ball of fire while I loosed some arrows at it, then Lucien ran
		 forward and cut it in twain.
			-"It's cooked! . . . And smells pretty good," I added.
			 "Party appetizers!" D'Roc suggested.
			 "Yeah! . . . Anyone know if it's unethical to eat. . . whatever that is?" I ssked.
		-There were still plenty of bird noises echoing through the cave so Sarge and D'Roc rushed
		 forward to join Lucien while I asked Grimble for some invisibility and crept forward myself.
		-Soon, another of the creatures soared out from the same hole in the cavern floor.
		-I loosed another arrow at it as it swooped at Lucien, the arrow hitting but it thankfully
		 missing Lucien, continuing past him as the devil-angel-man-whatever swiped at the
		 horse-bird-whatever with his blade.
			-(I'm not trying to give offense! Fuck knows whatever _I_ am. . .)
		-Lucien ran after the creature and lept onto it's back, sinking his blade into it's flank.
		-It fell to the earth, dead and bleeding, but unfortunately slipping into one of the nearby
		 cracks in the cavern floor. . . with Lucien sliding in after.
		-Fortunately, Jade's artifice meant I was hasted, so I rushed forward and tossed him a
		 rope. . . though my effort to wind it around a nearby root just ended up breaking the root,
		 and with me sliding toward the pit myself.
		-Thankfully, Grimble rushed forward to take hold of the rope too and we were soone joined
		 by Sarge as well, and the three of us were able to haul Lucien back up.
	-After that, we took some time to survey the cave, collecting various trinkets from the
	 hippogriffs' victims, while Lucien victimized one of the beasts in turn, butchering and cooking
	 it.
		-(Someone informed me what they were. I also learned they are delicious. Celestial animals
		  taste _good_!)


TODO:
	-Party prep!
		-Upper left is the exit nearest the airship, and a useful looking stage-like area.
		-Serve roast hippogriff?


3/10/25:
	-So, we proceeded to discuss the party plans. . .
		-My main priority was locating a suitably large depression in which to create a punch pool,
		 using my infinite rum bottle and whatever other flavors were on hand.
			-Lucien sagely suggested pouring some Abyssal Temptation in, to which I enthusiastically
			 agreed. Twice-spiked punch!
			-I located a suitable depression near the entrance, so people could fill their glasses,
			 buckets, or whatever as they came in, and began pouring. . . which continued for 45
			 minutes or so.
			-Lucien indeed poured in two bottles of Abyssal Temptation too.
		-D'Roc saw to roasting those hippogriffs, fashioning a fire and spit and carefully tending
		 the roasting horse-bird meat.
			-Grimble contributed his alchemical skill to creating an assortment of sauces.
		-Maya and Jade finally joined us from the ship when we ran back to it for supplies.
			-Jade mentioned a suitable occasion celebrated on the plane, some night of revels, that
			 we could also use as a party excuse.
			-Maya, getting into the spirit of things too, started directing bits of the prep and
			 decor to suit our noble elven-ish guests.
		-We were even joined by Kaelith and some of his lionel brethren, having heard the rumors
		 and smelled the meat cooking.
			-We talked them into playing security for the party (though reassured them that
			 definitely didn't preclude partaking of the punch).
				-"I like my bouncers like I like myself," I said. "Pretty drunk."
		-We also opted to make the party a masquerade too.
			-For my own costume, I decided to pour Uncle Rov onto my face, asking him to take
			 advantage of his slime-self-shaping abilities as suited him, for my mask.
		-We even spent a bit of time actually planning the murder, deciding to make our stand, and
		 introduce our guest of honor, on a raised bit of the cave floor near the tunnel leading
		 back to our ship.
			-Lucien mentioned his grandmother would probably bite at rumors about both her shameful
			 kin _and_ the resulting murdering of her daughter, and suggested spreading them around
			 the party.
	-We settled on tomorrow for the date of the party, and began distributing invites with the help
	 of the lionel.
	-We spent the intervening time resting in the cave system while D'Roc tended to his meat.
	-By midmorning the next day, people were already lining up outside and soon filtering inside.
		-I pressed our guests to indulge themselves at the punch pool, set up a quartet of gnomish
		 bards for music, and took some pixie powder (or whatever it was) from a pouch one of our
		 guests had.
		-Soon the party was in full swing, and I was too.
		-Busied myself spreading slanderous rumors about Lucien's grandmother, Leansia, and her
		 family. Some of them were even true!
	-Eventually there was some commotion at the entrance, some haughty elf-like lady pushing her
	 way in past the bouncers, but D'Roc went to address the matter.
		-The problem person, an elf-looking lady who, though scantily clad and apparently unarmed,
		 clearly moved like a warrior.
		-She and Lucien got to arguing. . . which soon turned into an especially aggresive dance
		 battle.
			-This party was amazing!
		-Lucien seemed to get the better of the dance-battle. . . but, then again, the walls seemed
		 to be melting.
		-Either way, the lady stormed off in a huff, with Lucien following a few steps behind
		 growling arguments and accusations at her.
		-Arguing turned into fighting, and thankfully the lady was unarmed as she was fast as fuck.
			-Faster, even, than the thankfully _armed_ Lucien.
		-I employed my precognition (which said shit's about to go down at this party) and ducked
		 behind a rock.
		-Maya tried to calm things down, but our fast foe proved immune even to her considerable
		 charm.
		-D'Roc though stepped between the pair and demanded she calm the fuck down, which at least
		 got her to turn around and begin storm out, yelling a "Your grandmother will hear of
		 this!" as she did.
		-Not content with that, Bruce, Lucien, and Maya all called out arguments concerning how
		 Lucien was clearly wronged by his grandmother.
		-Shockingly, the force of all that _did_ seem to calm things down, and the lady even paused
		 for another drink.
		-Shit, I think Lucien even began trying to chat her up.
			-Maya was naturally all about this, and even commissioned an illusory "Kiss the birthday
			 boy!" tunic from Grimble.
		-Yep, pretty soon they were making out. Well, OK, fine, a kiss on the cheek.
		-She did agree to go fetch his grandma, and took off shortly thereafter.
	-That confrontation seemed to sour the mood of some of the party goers, who started heading home.
		-Many of those that remained seemed _excited_ by the confrontation, though, if anything.
	-An hour or so later, we got word from the bouncers: Leansia had been sighted at the door.
		-Lucien walked forward to the town-side entrance, and confronted her.
		-The two of them began talking in heated tones, though I maintained a respectful (and safe
		 distance), not hearing much of it.
			-Though that didn't stop me from shouting "You tell her!" and the like. . .
		-The debate went on for some time. . . and even managed to shake Maya's faith in the
		 goodness of the multiverse. :(
		-Maya clearly didn't _entirely_ lose her faith in goodness and justice, though, as she
		 shuffled over to me and showed me some shining silver fabric in her pack: the cloak Bahamut
		 had given her to take Edric to court.
			-"Fred, it sounds like Leansia needs to face justice. . ." May began.
			 "Say no more!" I slurred, taking the cloak from her. "Grimble! Hide me!"
		-Grimble scurried over to me and, with a gesture, some arcane syllables, and a tap from the
		 gnome, I was soon invisible and creeping towards Leansia.
		-Well, I may have had more rum than was adviseable for creeping, and kept bumping into
		 things and tripping over the uneven cavern floors as I approached, but Maya attempted to
		 distract the celestial grandmother while I attempted to pretend to be a drunk pixie.
			-The former didn't work. . . but, shockingly, the latter did! Well, I guess it's
			 honestly not that far off who I am. . . especially after all that pixie dust.
		-Once close to Leansia, I lunged forward and wrapped her in the cloak.
		-In the blink of an eye, we were elsewhere, standing before an enormous silver dragon
		 sitting at an enormous desk.

4/7/25:
	-Bahamut's paralegal greeted us, saying, "Oh! You're back! What's happened now?"
		-I proceeded to explain that, "Well, mixed interplanar family, grandmother murders mother. . .
		  A whole sordid story, crying out for justice, and, well, we naturally thought of you lot!"
		-Well, the clerk made some noises about paperwork he'd need to attend to, and left us to
		 wait in a featureless void.
			-"So, drinks, then? I've got some rum!" I offered, to wide assent.
			-Jade was all business, though, and turned to some papers of her own, some designs she
			 was working on.
				-Asking her about the subject, she said it was her air-elemental-cruelty-free
				 airship engines she'd proposed, a project I enthusiastically commended her on.
		-In three drinks or so, the clerk returned. . . seeming a bit flustered.
			-Apparently, expert filer though our scaley bureaucrat claimed to be, the paper work
			 was all chaos.
			-"In fact," he elaborated, "The plane itself is. . . a bit wonky. You see, Bahamut is. . .
			  not here at the moment. The plane, then, is tightly linked to it's god."
		-He eventually admitted we could perhaps help him with that matter, help him to find his god.
			-Apparently Bahamut was known to wander, and had gone to visit an outdoor market North
			 of Vanguard Keep that he was fond of, but had been gone unusually long.
			-We agreed to help and, after a brief discussion of transit and the safety of our ship,
			 he shifted us back to The Material Plane, just outside the market.
				-My crew was with the ship, and the lion men were thankfully about as well. I figured
				 they had good reason to regard us fondly, as did many of the other partygoers.
		-Before he took his leave of us, I asked him about how we should get back.
			-"Don't worry. Bahamut can easily return you to his plane," the dragon-clerk said.
			 "What about a way back, or to get in touch, if the situation is. . . more complicated," I
			 clarified.
			 "Well, you still have the cloak. . . that can take you back there," he replied.
		-That was good enough for me, and soon the dragon was gone.
	-"Well, if you look over yonder," I began, "That looks to be a bar. Shall we start there?"
		-I greeted the bartender and asked what she was pouring.
		-When she replied mostly wine, I asked for the house red, saying I had a theme going, while
		 gesturing to my clothes.
			-What I received was a _very_ oaky red wine, near brandy-strong. Bit abrasive, but good!
		-Eventually, we got around to asking about our quarry, inquiring about an elderly man
		 accompanied by his birds.
		-She'd indeed seen an old man with seven yellow birds. He'd been touring the market's
		 various venders of magic trinkets.
	-Our next stop then was a nearby wagon with an array of items marked in draconic runes and the
	 like.
		-Our old man had indeed been there, and purchased a number of items, paying all in platinum,
		 but seemed particularly interested in a lantern.
			-It was no ordinary lantern, he clarified (of course not), but a one-of-a-kind work of
			 magic which is said to show the bearer the path to his heart's desire.
			-Well, that potentially complicates things, as who knows where that would lead a dragon
			 god. . .
		-Fortunately, Jade provided a very reasonable suggestion, that boiled down to, have you tried
		 magic?
			-She fell to leafing through tomes she drew forth from her pack, muttering, "Perhaps a
			 sending. . . Or divine communion?"
		-While Jade debated her options, Maya addressed her little dragon familiar, asking if he
		 perhaps had a way of seeking out his divine draconic forebearer.
			-The critter at least suggest he could try tracking him, picking up his sent and such,
			 a project D'Roc quickly joined him in.
			-They were indeed able to follow some footprints and the scent of an elderly man, leading
			 off from the magic vendor's wagon and into the woods.
	-We followed the tiny dragon and the enormous bull-man into the woods, until they called a halt
	 well out of sight of the market.
		-They pointed out where the footsteps stopped, becoming instead scuffed earth and crushed
		 vegetation, as if our quarry fell to the earth.
		-"Shit! How deep do you think the old-man shape goes?" I asked in alarm. "D'you think he
		 broke a hip or something?!?"
		-That was met with shrugs, but D'Roc at least had a theory of what led to the fall: a snare.
		-Several of us then looked about, including up, for evidence of our trap, and noticed
		 something funny about a large tree looming over the site of our scuffle.
			-A section of it was dead and warped, as if it had been caught on the edge of some magic
			 effect.
			-"Shit! You're saying the tree was involved?!? I know the leafy motherfuckers couldn't
			 be trusted. Don't have 'em where I'm from and I've been nervous around 'em since
			 getting here! Could fall on you any moment!" I rambled.
			-I was a bit put out that no one appeared to be paying much attention to my ranting,
			 but their discussion of the nature of the tree's damage and anti-magic fields bore
			 fruit: they were pretty sure such a field had damaged the tree and been used to trap
			 our dragon god in the form he'd shapeshifted into.
				-". . . Aren't several of _us_ magic? Is this shit unhealthy?" I asked. "Jaspar!
				 How are you doing?"
				-To my great dismay, my shoes did not respond. . .
				-Perhaps even more concerning, when I consoled myself with a swig of my rum bottle,
				 it didn't refill!
		-With that element of the trap in mind, I suggested, "Can't those of you arcanely-inclined
		 examine magic traces and the like? There something you can learn from this?"
			-Indeed, it turned out, they could!
			-A combination of Jade and Maya were able to follow traces of magic away from the scene
			 of the kidnapping, which lead up into the air, something about it's motions saying to
			 Jade "airship".
			-Thankfully too, Jaspar began to respond once we were some distance away, though he
			 described a terrifying experience of blankness.
			-Checking my rum bottle, it had also refilled, though another swig tasted. . . harsher?
			 Less well-aged perhaps. . .
				-"Those motherfuckers! They'll pay for this! They've made an enemy for life!" I
				 shouted.
	-We followed the aerial trail some distance overland, until it reached a cliff face.
		-With Maya possessed of both wings and Detect Magic, she was able to fly up and see that
		 the trail led to a cave in the cliff, high above.
		-With some short debate, we all found ways to either fly or climb up the mountainside,
		 reaching the cave.
		-Looking inside, we could see it was in fact a concealed airdock inside the cave, with
		 tunnels leading deeper into the mountain, an airship sitting there at rest.
			-A _rather nice_ ship, with a fancy-looking dragon figurehead on the front. . .
			-It _does_ help to have a back up ship, as we've established several times, and,
			 well, I _am_ a pirate. . .
	-Perched at the mouth of the cave, D'Roc warned us that he could hear a guard or the like,
	 partroling a regular path within, somewhere past the airships bulk.
		-After some whispered debate, Grimble rendered everyong within ten feet of D'Roc invisible,
		 and we stumbled forward as a ball of lunatics, clanking rather loudly in our armor and such.
		-That. . . did not fool the guard, who rushed forward to investigate and turned out to be a
		 githyanki.
		-Maya attempted to address the matter through charm, foresaking the invisibility for some
		 arcane syllables, and soon she and the guard were good friends.
		-That, though, simply lead to the guard pulling her aside and shouting, "Look out! Something
		 is creeping up behind you!"
		-He hurled a vial of what turned out to be alchemist's fire at our feet, as we all rolled
		 away from D'Roc, trying to dodge with varying degrees of success and losing our invisibility.
		-Maya was quick to explain that we were in fact her body guards, resulting some apologies
		 from the guard.
		-She was quick to interrogate her new friend, learning that nine of his fellows were deeper
		 inside the mountain, and had indeed captured an old man. He was even willing to sketch us
		 a quick map to them.
		-We thanked him for his help and promised to put in a good word with his superiors on his
		 behalf, then followed his map into the tunnels.
	-We were no more successful trying to silence our clammor as we moved through the tunnels, so it
	 was no surprise when we were soon met by another two githyanki guards, brandishing greatswords
	 and shouting warcries.
		-Thankfully, axe and spell made short work of that all.
	-Following our map, we eventually felt our various bits of magic fail us, we having found the
	 anti-magic effect.
		-But, interestingly, my psionic precognition _did not_ fail, though things got a bit. . .
		 static-y.
	-Shortly thereafter, we emerged into a chamber in which an elderly man sat in an iron cage of
	 fine meshwork, chatting with seven yellow birds.
		-D'Roc had no trouble wrenching the cage's door open, despite it's lock, and soon the man
		 was free, and greeting Maya.
		-I asked if the lamp had led him to what he wanted, and he replied that it was instead cursed.
			-"I figured," I replied, "But figured I should check. I don't judge, and who knows what
			 you're into."
		-We quickly made to leave, and as soon as we were past the anti-magic field, old man Bahamut
		 whisked us off the plane and back to his court.


4/21/25:
	-We found ourselves waiting before Bahamut's paralegal (something that sounded like Susan?),
	 Bahamut nowhere in sight now.
		-The courts back in order, Susan now asked us what god we wished empaneled to hear our case,
		 triggering much debating and recapping among our party.
			-I pointed out that we were looking for _harsh_ justice, given both Lucien's _very_
			 personal interest in the matter and that deal we made with that lich queen.
			-Maya said Bahamut was known for his mercy and such, rather not what we were aiming for
			 here, but that Cuthbert was the god of retribution.
			-We decided to defer to Lucien here (again, given the personal nature of the case), and
			 he called for Cuthbert.
		-Susan then raised the matter of witnesses we might like to call, leading to yet more debate.
			-Apparently this is the kind of court that accepts the testimony of ghosts, leading to
			 some kind of fun divination ritual in which Lucien got to experience the death of his
			 mother firsthand.
				-". . . Need a drink after that, Lucien?" I said, offering the rum bottle.
				 "I. . . will save my getting plastered until after the trial," he replied.
				 "Well, suit yourself!" I said, taking a long swig.
			-I also suggested that Gramma Lucien also made a confession of a kind at the party,
			 proposing that we call someone who witnessed that.
				-"While I myself _never_ lie. . ." I began, only to be drowned out by guffaws.
				-"Ahem. You, hit it off with that scary lady, right, Lucien?" I tried again. "She
				  seemed a kind of credible. . ."
	-Our preparations made, we suddenly found ourselves standing in a courtroom, three gods
	 presiding.
		-Two appeared as elderly men, though, armored and with his trademark cudgel, Cuthbert was
		 unmistakeable.
		-The other was more simply attired and I heard Bruce reverently whisper the name Obad Hai.
		-The third appeared a young man, shirtless and bemuscled, who Maya named Kord, God of
		 Strength.
	-Lucien, as the accuser, was asked to give the opening statement.
		-He quite eloquently laid out the case that his _cowardly_ grandmother killed her daughter,
		 not in war, but to save herself _embarrassment_, enlisting the aid of her very enemies,
		 the family of his daughter's lover, in the murder.
			-"That sneaky politician!" I shouted, from the gallery.
			 "There will be silence from the peanut gallery," Obad Hai pronounced.
			 ". . . Wait. There's peanuts? Grimble, see if we can get a bag. . ." I rambled.
				-Obad Hai waved his hand and a peanut plant sprouted from the bench beside me and,
				 with a little bow of thanks, I dug in.
	-Our celestial murderer then issued her response, going on about the shame and disappointment
	 she'd been afflicted with by her daughter's acts, the response it demanded, and how one did
	 what she had to do.
		-It was hardly convincing, with only Kord, Mr. Might-Makes-Right, seeming the least bit
		 receptive.
	-There was then some back and forth concerning how much control she really had over the demons
	 who were involved, and how this had been _supposed_ to go down.
		-She sort of alleged she hadn't _really_ meant to cause her daughter's _death_.
		-Lucien convincingly condemned her actions, and pointed out she then proceeded to _conceal_
		 these acts she now claimed were oh-so-justified.
			-I mumbled my approval through a mouthful of peanuts.
	-Grandma Celestial (as is becoming clear, I forgot her name) then called a witness, a soldier
	 that had been under her command and was there for the death of Lucien's mother.
		-He told a sob story about what a bloodbath it was, but it was hardly relevant given that
		 she's the one who set the whole mess up in the first place (a fact I couldn't resist
		 pointing out from the gallery).
	-Our triumvirate acknowledged the testimony given and then disappeared from sight, beginning
	 their deliberation.
	-Returning a few moments later, Obad Hai pronounced the judgment, saying that her conspiring
	 with demons was vile. . . but not murder.
		-Instead, he named it a most severe form of manslaughter, a thing which the consequence is
		 not death, but exile.
	-The sentence made, Lucien's grandmother disappeared from sight, and a moment later we too were
	 elsewhere, back to Susan the scaly paralegal.
		-Looking at her papers, she said, "I see you had a good outcome. .. "
		 "The peanuts were good. . . but there was no justice to be had!" I announced.
			-That occasioned a quick discussion about whether they could be improved with the use
			 of Flumphs' Blue Salt, and if the god of nature would be amenable to a business deal.
		-"Excuse me," Maya then interjected. "She was exiled. . . Exiled to _where_?"
		 "Oh," Susan said. "To the in-between. A nothingness between the planes, where she will be
		  alone with her thoughts. . . Some say there are creatures there, but presumably just
		  those sentenced to such an exile."
	-That left us to debate where next to go.
		-Jade was eager to resume her labors on various magical projects, and for the reagents she
		 required to do so. A pile of treasure burning a metaphorical hole in our literal pockets
		 and various magical dreams meant we were all in enthusiastic agreement.
			-Maya also volunteered that she had plenty of money back in Sasserine.
		-I did point out, though, that we needed to retrieve our ship, and get it back to someplace
		 useful, which meant unwinding several things, most noteably our deal with the lich queen of
		 the Githyanki and the navigation system we were promised for a thing we argueably
		 accomplished.
		-That elicited it's own agreement and so Susan waved a claw in an arcane gesture.
	-The platinum cloak's spell thusly ended, we found ourselves returned to the party, which had
	 grown quite raucous, though it was mostly the lion men that remained, dancing in a conga line,
	 brawling with each other, and continuing to work their way through the punch pool.
		-Lucien's wild-haired dance partner remained too, though, and swiftly approached us, saying,
		 "I had a feeling you'd be back."
		 "Of course!" I replied. "The party's still going!"
		-She inquired as to her compatriot's fate, and we broke the news of her exile to the in-
		 between.
			-"I see. Perhaps a fate crueler than death," she remarked.
			 "But a fate deemed just by no less than three gods," I countered.
			 ". . . I see. Then. . . I suppose it must be so."
		-She then began to kvetch about the gap this left in the leadership of Aborea.
			-"Do you know how difficult it is to lead these people?" she complained. "It is enough
			  to drive one mad. . ."
			 "Perhaps," Lucien began, "It _takes_ a madman. . ."
			-I don't know why he and Jade kept glancing at me, but I _did_ sense an opportuninty,
			 and said, "Well, _I_ did get them all pointed in the direction of one hell of a party.
			  And this place does have it's upsides: fun people, one hell of a party store. . ."
			 "Can you stay here to do so, though?" our native interlocutor asked. "Can _any_ of you?"
			 "Ah, you got me there," I admitted. "My heart belongs to the air."
			-She then spoke of a tournament, one of strength, cleverness, and the hunt. Apparently
			 it's the usual way of settling such things around here.
				-Though she did say it would be a while at best before such an undertaking could be
				 put together.
					-I suspect the difficulty managing her people was a factor there.
				-Still, it's an intriguing idea, a thing we could participate in on our own behalfs,
				 or on behalf of another, as she did mention a practice of champions.
					-I wonder if The Party Lizard would be interested? We could support him, as some
					 kind of Party Lizard Party, to enact The Party Lizard Party's Party Platform:
					 party!

5/19/25:
	-Well, back at the party cave, and over some drinks with already hammered lion-men, we discussed
	 our next moves some more.
		-We also took a quick trip to town: to sell loot, and buy more snacks and drinks.
			-(And some crafting components for Jade, as I had her make my cloak even fancier, with
			  some help from that magic crystal.)
		-Maya was eager to retrun to Sasserine, and I to unwind our deal with the lich queen, so,
		 since our reward there was to be a navigation system for the ship, that seemed the thing
		 to pursue.
			-I did think to ask Jade, "Will this navigation system have a margin of error measured
			 in hundreds of miles, like Plane Shift?"
			-She explained that, no, the new engine we installed in the ship has "advanced memory
			 banks", meaning that it would be able to at least return to places it had previously
			 been with great accuracy. Handy!
	-The party had been waning in our absence, but, with our return, it was ebbing once more!
		-I found myself passing out thimbles of liquor to a cloud of tiny fairies, and got to asking
		 them if they'd consider shipboard life, seeing the multi-verse and all that!
		-They inquried about the view of the stars from the airship ("Fantastic! You're closer!")
		 and similar details, and eventually a bunch of these "Coure" signed on!
	-Sarge had a project of his own to pursue too, and one that Aborea might provide a useful
	 setting for.
		-He knew a spell that called for dragon scales, and wanted to seek some out.
		-Maya knew there was said to be an ancient brass dragon that made it's lair on Aborea,
		 though Sarge pointed out that brass dragons were generally _good_, and that "ancient"
		 means "dangerous" where dragons are concerned.
		-I, though, proposed we _bargain_ instead, maybe even acquire two dragon scale flavors at
		 once! I suggested we offer to "take care of" an _evil_ dragon, in exchange for a scale
		 shed by this noble brass one.
		-My brilliant plan was almost as persuasive as I am, so we went about seeking to do just
		 that.
		-Our first step was to find this brass dragon.
			-Asking around town, we learned that is was said that $DRAGON_NAME, the ancient dragon
			 in question, was said to "listen on the wind" for those calling out for aid.
			-Sarge proposed several wind-conjuring spells, but Maya short-circuited all that by just
			 calling out to the breeze, beseeching the aid of a mighty dragon.
			-Beloved of the dragon god as Maya is, it was perhaps unsurprising that her efforts
			 yielded a response, words in Draconic carried back to us on the wind.
			-The voice and Sarge then had an extended debate.
				-It did a lot of moralizing, and I'm not sure they actually reached any kind of
				 deal for _it's_ scale or not, but it was very big on protecting the weak and told
				 us of a marauding _red_ dragon that terrorized an island known as Acheron,
				 elsewhere on this plane.
		-So, we returned to our ship and set sail for a different layer of Aborea, the one on which
		 the isle of Acheron lay.
			-Sailing there took half a day, during which we rested up for our big show and talked
			 about the plan.
			-We settled on luring the dragon with the sight of a rich (but illusory) caravan market.
			-Grimble and Sarge asserted that red dragons love rubies, the gems being a status symbol
			 amongst their kind, so I spread rumors around the nearby towns of the "upcoming
			 market" and the presence of "Rob the Red, ruby merchant".
		-We then sailed to the location I cited in our rumors.
			-We landed the ship some distance away. D'Roc camouflaged it to blend with the nearby
			 vegetation and Lucien, Jade, Bruce, and the crew stayed behind to guard it while the
			 rest of us went to set up our ambush.
			-Grimble conjured our illusory market and the rest of us proceeded to pretend to be
			 shopkeepers.
			-It seemed I did _too_ good with the rumors, though, as all sorts of people began to
			 try and show up to this legendary market they'd heard about.
				-I none too politely informed them that their clothes marked them as unworthy of
				 the time of "Rob the Red", they being clearly unable to afford my rubies.
				-Some were _still_ intent on rushing in, but D'Roc played bouncer and threw them
				 out (in some cases literally).
			-Eventually, the people approaching the market switched to running away screaming,
			 causing us to look to the sky where we indeed saw the distant silhouette of a large
			 dragon approaching.
		-We lay in wait for the approaching beast, Grimble and I under the cover of some of the
		 (real) trees, though others took up more obvious defensive positions.
			-Sarge was first to act, conjuring sleet where the dragon flew, disorienting it and
			 slowing it's flight.
			-As it emerged from the sleet, we let loose with various projectiles and spells, to
			 varying effect.
			-It, meanwhile, flew at the also flying, also draconic Sarge, snapping at the war mage
			 and dealing grevious wounds with it's teeth.
			-It now being nearer, though, a different solution came to my mind: my mind! I proceeded
			 to replace it's will with my own. . .
			-I then forced the dragon to land and, mindful of providing a some plausibility to the
			 mind-controlled beast, I claimed I really _was_ interested in the ruby deal, though
			 I had suspected it wouldn't deal fairly.
			-Talking up the quality of the enormous rubies my ship's hold was _definitely full of,
			 I convinced/forced it to bring us to it's lair, to arrange a trade in exchange for a
			 a portion of it's horde.
		-We returned to the ship and took flight, following the beast to it's lair, which proved to
		 be in a volcano in the islands mountainous spine.
			-As we neared the volcano, our ship was buffetted by the volcanic winds, but the crew
			 and I masterfully kept it under control while I kept the dragon's mind in thrall.
			-The beast led us to it's lair, but the cave in which it dwelled, with it's rivers of
			 lava, looked a bit hot for most of us to handle, so I insisted that the great beast
			 bring out it's horde to us, to the nearby clifftop where we landed the ship, that we
			 might deal.
			-_That_ proved to be a step too far out of character for the scaly creature and, in a
			 renewed struggle of wills, the dragon broke my hold on it's mind.
			-Where more aggressive mind control failed, Maya's charm stepped in (though I think she
			 too may have been cheating a bit, with the power of her patron).
			-Wiser in the ways of dragons than I, and more polite in general, Maya was quite a bit
			 more deferential, playing to the great beast's pride and asking it to bring out just 
			 _some_ of it's wonderous treasures, which would _surely_ be more than enough to exchange
			 for our rubies. . .
			-It's suspicions roused, the dragon selected some choice items from it's horde and
			 brought them to the edge of it's fiery cave.
			-Among the treasures was a very fine red cloak, a thing that Maya politely asked if she
			 could be allowed to try on.
			-The dragon assented and Maya braved the cave mouth's heat, flying down and putting on 
			 the cloak.
			-She then. . . froze? It took us a moment to realize something was up, and the dragon
			 even longer, but eventually it insisted the she return the cloak, reaching out to take
			 it and revealing this was nothing but the _illusion_ of Maya.
			-Remembering the gems of Mislead that gnomish cleric gave us, we looked about and
			 spotted Maya flying on her eldritch wings back to the clearing where we landed the
			 ship, already some distance from the dragon and still wearing the cloak.
			-The dragon soon noticed the same and, letting loose a mighty roar, it took wing and
			 flew towards us on.
			-Grimble uttered a few arcane syllables and then slapped Sarge on the back saying, "Go
			 get him!" Sure enough, Sarge's form blurred, the work of some illusion that would
			 certainly make him harder to hit, and then Sarge took flight himself.
			-As the dragon neared us, I, in a fit of unaccustomed bravery, ran a bit forward and
			 tried to _stab_ the dragon's mind this time.
			-My reward was a nasty bite from the unphased dragon that swooped down to meet me. I
			 shan't be doing _that_ again. . .
			-While the others let loose at the dragon with spell and stone, Grimble conjured a
			 maybe-real hippogriff to charge at the dragon and rescue me, but it's claws just slid
			 off the dragon's scales.
			-Sarge proved more effective, though, as he flew forward and conjured a cone of freezing
			 cold, halting the dragon's advance and causing it to collapse where it had stood.
		-Our victory in hand, Sarge got his dragon scale(s), and, with some work on Jade's part to
		 help us endure the heat for a time, we also got the contents of the dragon's horde!

6/4/25:
	-Well, we were still due to return to the Lich Queen, but did do some dithering, not being
	 _that_ eager to do so. . .
		-First off, she's fuckin' scary.
		-Second, we didn't _exactly_ kill Lucien's grandmother, though our solution was argueably
		 better (and I do love a good argument).
		-Maya and D'Roc also pointed out that, wait, aren't the Githyanki and their queen closely
		 allied with Tiamat? Who's rather fond of "her children", the chromatic dragons. . . like
		 the red one we just killed? Shit. . .
			-Sarge even pointed out that dragons frequently _mark_ the contents of their hoards in
			 some mystic way. . . a way that perhaps another dragon could detect.
	-In light of that last, we opted to head back to that Aborean city, to unload and otherwise
	 launder our loot, before returning to the Githyanki.
		-So, we loaded our captured hoard into the ship's hold and took to the air.
		-Speaking of the air, Sarge spoke _to_ the air, whispering (with some arcane assistance)
		 to that ancient _metallic_ dragon who set us on the trail of the red, reporting that the
		 deed was done. . .
			-Cocking his head, Sarge clearly heard some response and, a moment later, he explained
			 that the dragon had marked him in some arcane manner, in an offer of future work if
			 similar foes needed slaying.
			-He also felt confident that the mark would allow _him_ to speak with the dragon
			 across even extraplanar distances, should he require, with the aid of some otherwise
			 more limited messaging spell.
		-Sarge also experienced some kind of sinister vision?
			-He spoke of some kind of room filled with flame, maybe dragon fire. . . but it wasn't
			 all that clear to me what was going on. Sounded to me like he'd been hitting the
			 Abyssal Temptation. . .
		-As we flew back, Maya also had a suggestion: what if her familiar, a dragon himself, marked
		 the loot? Wouldn't that replace the mark?
			-The tiny dragon and our various arcanists certainly seemed to think so, so he went
			 through and handled each and every gem, coin, and whatever until he reported it all
			 marked. Problem solved!
		-Well, we headed back to town anyways, since all this money was still aching to be spent,
		 unloading our loot and doing a minor shopping spree.
			-Grimble, with the help of that magic crystal, learned a new spell in 10 minutes!
				-He also picked up an assortment of spell components.
			-Jade and Maya actually did something of the reverse, running around drumming up magic
			 crafting and building tasks for themselves, to earn some more cash.
	-Well, reasons to delay exhausted, we crushed a magic stone and then us and the ship were
	 wrenched back to The Astral Plane.
		-Docking, we found ourselves at the base of that pointlessly long stair again, met by some
		 guards.
		-They led us up that branching series of staircases, _supposedly_ up to the Lich Queen's
		 throne room. . . but Bruce noticed this path differed from the one we took before.
		-He pointed that out, calling the pair of guards out.
		-They claimed she they were leading us to a different location, but were obviously
		 suspicious.
		-". . . that wouldn't happen to be a room filled with dragonfire, would it?" I demanded,
		 thinking of Sarge's vision.
		-They hemmed and hawwed, so I resorted to. . . reasoning with them.
			-"Look," I said, "We can yell, scream, and threaten, rip secrets from each other's
			 minds, and all that. . . or just talk this out and then get something to drink?"
			-I _can_ be quite persuasive, and it seemed the reputation of my formidable mind had
			 preceeded me. . . but they also feared the legendary wrath of their queen.
			-"Well, have you tried the life of a freebooter?" I asked. "The pay _and_ booze are a
			  hell of a lot better. . . and a life on the run comes with the territory anyways."
			 "We've _already_ said far too much," one of the guards responded, "We need to get
			  out of here!"
			 "Freebootin' it is, then!" I exclaimed. "Let get the fuck gone!"
		-Of course, I explained that to get out of here, we really did need that navigation system
		 that the queen had (falsely) promised us.
		-The githyanki then described a workshop that handled ship repairs and such, where such a
		 thing could possibly be had, so I said they should take us there!
		-The guards led us up a different set of stairs, into a workshop filled with githyanki and
		 arcane machinery.
			-The guards nodded over at one of their fellow astral people, one wearing a fancy monocle
			 and hunched over some kind of clearly-magic crystal, surrounded as it was by several
			 shimmering images of itself.
			-I rushed over, all bluster, yelling about a special mission from the queen, a thing
			 of great urgency, and rambling about a celestial elf that should be dead but isn't .
			-Despite my convincing (only half an) act, the githyanki engineer _shushed_ me!
				-He said something about needing to stabilize the crystal first, to which I replied,
				 "Well, need an extra set of hands? Jade! Jade here can help, our ship's engineer. . ."
				 "Not unless she knows planar algebra. . ." he said, trying again to brush us off.
				-Jade, though, stepped in and the conversation quickly began to fly over my head, as
				 it seemed she _did_ know know alge-whatnot, and began to babble about 12 dimensions
				 and the like.
				-It seemed she _was_ able to help, and the matter was quickly settled.
			-His crystal stable, I again reiterated my partly bullshit plea for urgent help with a
			 navigation system.
			-This time, I seemed to get through to him and, though he made some noises about seeing
			 our orders in writing, Maya and I convinced him the matter was both too urgent and too
			 secret, so he set out for the warehouse connected to his workshop.
			-It was a big jumble, though, and he was taking forever to find what he was looking for.
				-Bruce had magic for that problem, though! A thing that could allow all our eyes to
				 work in unison for the search.
					-Actually, that seems quite handy for life aboard ship: https://dndtools.org/spells/players-handbook-ii--80/linked-perception--2943/
				-Together, then, we quickly found the navigation console he was looking for.
			-We then made a hasty departure, along with our two new Githyanki friends, returning to
			 our ship with the navigation console.
	-Jade made quick work of hooking the new navigation console up to our ship, which left us
	 debating our destination.
		-"I know Maya is eager to return home to Sasserine," I began, "But it might be wise to make
		  a quick detour somewhere, since we should probably be worried about pursuit by the Lich
		  Queen's forces."
		-That got a lot of nodding in assent.
		-Sadly, the (former) guards were no help with that, having spent their lives in a society
		 and religion that insisted the queen had eyes everywhere.
		-Maya, though, suggested that lawfully aligned planes might be our best option for sanctuary,
		 given the nature of the Lich Queen and her ally Tiamat.
			-That was met with a big grown of disappointment from me, as such places sound boring
			 and bereft of good booze. I especially shuddered at the mention of Mechanus, which
			 sounded like a place where everyone drank oil or some such, and thankfully talked
			 everyone out of _that_ option.
		-We settled on Mount Celestia, a place that certainly wouldn't take kindly to the queen of
		 the githyanki or the goddess of evil dragons.

6/16/25:
	-With a moment's respite on this celestial plane, we spent some time discussing what we wanted
	 to do from here.
		-Ultimately, we decided to hope this brief stop would throw the lich queen off our tail, or
		 at least that she wouldn't be all _that_ intent on revenge, since we really just held her

6/30/25:
	-Back in Sasserine, the whole crew and I headed straight to a bar.
		-I got the first round, and got the party started!
		-Gradually, some of the party snuck off to attend to various bits of business, but us
		 hardcore party people kept at it.
		-Soon I was buying whiskey-and-oil cocktails for an animated chain named Frank that had
		 slithered down from upstairs, trying to set it up with my boots, and dancing on a table.
		-Grimble set up a small alchemist lab on a nearby table and got to brewing something firey,
		 though he had to keep slapping away the hands of crew members that tried to grab and drink
		 from the beakers.


8/11/25:
	-A month, and many drinks later. . .
	-Maybe _too_ many drinks. . . as I heard some clinking and, looking down, there was a
     surprisingly well dressed chicken pecking at my glass of whiskey.
		-Naturally, I offered to buy the chicken a drink of his own. . . but got about the response
		 you'd expect from a chicken, with him cocking his head and looking at me quizzically.
		-About that time a(nother) gnome, dressed in wizard robes, burst into the bar, yelling,
		 "Grab that chicken!"
		-I shrugged and made a grab for the bird, but only caught a feather as the chicken
		 _teleported_ across the room.
		-Several of my crewmates seemed to be game for the chase too, with D'Roc trying the seize
		 the bird also, but crashing into furniture instead, and Lucien trying to scare the bird
		 into submission (turns out terrified chickens don't hold still).
		-After a few moments, the chicken started making for the open door.
		-Pretty though I may be, I decided to try using my head. . . and hypnotized the chicken.
		-D'Roc took the opportunity to take hold of the chicken.
		-"So, the bird's not going anywhere for a bit," I began, addressing the new gnome. "What's
		  this all about?"
		 "That bird owes me a drink!" the gnome replied. "Out of a very special goblet, in fact. . ."
		-He went on to explain that the chicken had somehow stolen this goblet from him, and hidden
		 it from him.
			-"Of course, he wasn't always a chicken. . . A spell rebounded, there was a magic
			  accident, you know how it goes."
		-"Well. . . How do your propose to interrogate this chicken?" I asked the gnome.
		 "I'd been planning to detect his thoughts. . . though I'm not sure that's an option, while
		  you are. . . doing. . . whatever you've done here."
		 "Ah! Well, D'Roc, got a good hold on him?"
		 "Wait!" the gnome interjected. "Hang on. Let me cast something first, to anchor him here.
		  Don't want him teleporting off again. . ."
		 "Oh! Yeah, prudent!"
		-The gnome went about muttering some arcane symbols and such, and then nodded to me when the
		 spell was complete.
		-I released my hold on the chicken's mind and he began to struggle in D'Roc's grasp but
		 couldn't get free.
		-"Thank you very much for your help," the gnome said. "What's the fee for chicken catching
		  these days? Here, have a hundred gold. . . I'll take the chicken, then, and be on my way."
		-That seemed a surprising but welcome sum to me. . . but Bruce raised a hand. Walking over
		 to me, he whispered, "Keep the gnome talking. Something is suspicious. . ." He then went
		 over to confer with Jade.
		-I began pestering the gnome about the best liquors to fill a fancy goblet and such while
		 Jade fiddled with a stick she'd pulled out from her pack, applying various substances to
		 it while muttering.
		-The gnome seemed eager to get out of there but D'Roc wasn't handing over the chicken.
		-After a few moments, Jade took her stick and bonked the chicken on his head. . . and the
		 chicken proceeded to turn into a naked man clutching tiny chicken clothes to his loins.
			-"Wait," I demanded. "The clothes didn't change with him?!? Someone is making tiny
			  chicken finery! What have we gotten involved in?!?"
			-Jade grabbed him a tea towel from the bar.
		-At this point, D'Roc noticed the strange gnome beginning to sidle towards the door, and
		 shouted to Lucien, who stood near the gnome, to grab him.
		-In the blink of an eye, Lucien had one hand on the gnome and another on a knife at the
		 little guy's throat.
		-Talking to the mostly-nude former-chicken, we quickly learned that:
			-He was a young noble of House Lorchester, minor nobility of Sasserine.
			-This gnome was part of a group that ambushed him one night as he was walking home
			 drunk, turning him into a chicken and kidnapping him, presumably for ransom.
		-He asked if we would walk him back to his family, who would surely offer a reward.
			-Maya asked that the Lorchester grant us a commensurate favor, instead of cash, and he
		     eagerly agreed.
			-Jade pointed out we should find him some clothes first, and Maya chimed in asking
			 Grimble if his theater troupe kin were still in Sasserine, they having provided us
			 tailoring in the past.
				-He nodded and fluttered out the door in search of them.
				-A drink or two later, he returned with a rather garish noble costume, something
				 suited to a play.
				-After young Lorchester got dressed, D'Roc whispered to me and pointed out that
				 there were subtle chickens sewed and embroidered into various bits of the garments.
					-_So_ glad to have you back, Grimble!
	-We then escorted the young nobleman back to his family's estate.
		-They were not _quite_ thrilled to see him, in a way that painted him as something of an
		 embarassment, and casting some amount of doubt on the value of the favor he'll be able to
		 wring from his kin.
	-Afterwards, we took some time to interrogate our gnomish chicken knapper.
		-Maya was particularly offended that they were preying on the nobles of _her_ city.
			-And, I suspect, saw some political advancement for her to be seen stopping it.
		-He was easily intimidated, but also clearly not the mastermind of this all, nor powerful
		 enough a wizard to have accomplished the polymorph.
		-He said he was part of a gang led by a halfling with long red hair that sticks straight
		 up and a distinctive scar.
		-He also admitted they were planning to kidnap another noble after an upcoming feast, in
		 three days time.
			-That event turned out to by _Maya's_ party.
			-Now it's _personal_.
			-"Also, Maya. . . I wasn't invited?!?" I asked, incredulous.
			 "But I _did_ invite you, Fred!" she replied. ". . . you must have forgotten, in your
			  time at that bar."
			 "Oh. That sounds likely."
		-With Jade's help, and the perfidious gnome's description, we employed scrying magic to see
		 the image of our halfling mastermind.
			-He indeed looked like the kind of creepy fuck that would be turning people into
			 chickens. . . and sewing tiny outfits for them: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1404652962231488582
			-He sat at table writing letters, surrounded by animals. . . also in tiny noble
			 outfits?!? It was like some kind of demented petting zoo.
			-Bruce, peering closely into the mirror Jade had worked her scrying magic with, was
			 able to identify the letters as _invoices_, not ransom notes as we'd presumed, which
			 fortunately included an address on Cloud street.


8/26/25:
	-(I missed a session due to the broken toe.)


9/22/25:
	-Well, everyone seemed quite keen to follow up on all sorts of leads but, after a month's binge
	 drinking. . . I really needed a drink. So, I volunteered to watch the prisoner.
		-I didn't have any shackles or the like, but. . . "Hey, you're pint-sized. . ." I said to
		 the gnome. "How many pints can you hold?"
		 "A surprising amount," he claimed, so we went back to the bar to test that.
			-I figured he can't run off if he can't walk, let alone in a straight line.
		-Back at the bar, we went straight to shots. I matched him one for one, but soon caught him
		 trying to cheat by spilling liquor on the floor.
		-"Oh!" I exclaimed. "My shoes should get in on this!"
		-Looking down at my boots, I said, "Jaspar! If I pour some rum down you, you're not going
		 to go teleporting it away into some nearby chamber pot or. . . _gnome_. . . again, are you?"
		-Jaspar took my meaning and, after a long pour of rum, our prisoner couldn't even _sit_
		 upright.
		-Though the gnome could now barely speak, he _did_ seem to be trying to cast some kind of
		 spell, mumbling requests for various components.
			-I just kept handing him various things I found around the bar: pickled eggs, old corks,
			 and the like. Needless to say, he didn't get very far.
	-Eventually the party came to find me.
		-They were all talking over each other, telling me about someone planning to build some kind
		 spider-flesh golem, digging up bits from the pits around the arena (given all it's fantastic
		 beast combats and such).
			-I didn't quite catch how this was connected to the kidnapping, but, well, they were
			 excited by the matter and I figured, eh, what the hells.
		-After some discussion of how we could track these nefarious spider stitchers down, Maya
		 threw out the idea of luring them to _us_.
			-From what they'd learned and what Jade knew of the construct construction process, they
			 had plenty of _parts_, but needed a soul to animate the thing.
			-Maya proposed spreading a rumor about the discovery of some trapped and especially
			 desirable soul, like that of a half-god, and I took the idea and ran with it.
				-We had a quick discussion of where we'd try to lure these freaks _to_ and, after
				 Jade seemed none too excited by Maya's proposal of her magic shop, we settled on
				 the old temple in that cavern on a nearby isle where the Shapers had been making
				 their weresharks.
			-I spent the rest of the evening popping into half the taverns in the city, talking
			 about how some remnants of the Shapers had found a crystal containing the soul of a
			 child of Lolth, _the_ thing you'd want for any spider-abominations you'd happen to be
			 building, and that they had stashed the thing at their old temple.
				-Word spread like wildfire, probably because I'm so amazing at everything, and,
				 before we'd turned in for the night, the city was buzzing with the rumor.
				-We even saw vendors selling bracelets and charms featuring sharks with spider legs!
				 They work fast!
	-Arriving the temple-cavern, it was much as we left it: drenched in blood. . . but the _corpses_
	 were gone. . .
		-Well, that being a bit suspicious, D'Roc and Maya went to go search the place for evidence
		 of what happened to the bodies while the rest of us began getting stuff set up.
		-The first sign something was wrong Maya beginning to say, "D'Roc. . ."
		-That was followed by a thud and and thunderous "Ugh!" of disgust from our might minotaur.
		-Looking in their direction, I saw D'Roc being accosted by an animate mass of disgusting
		 black ooze.
		-. . . I wisely ran for some cover, in the opposite direction.
		-Maya blasted the ooze, though, to it's seeming dismay, and D'Roc, with somewhat more. . .
		 complicated effect, cleaved the ooze in twain. . . only for both halves of the mass to
		 continue lunging at him with disgusting psuedopods.
		-Grimble, laughing, pointed out the stuff looked like pitch and, fluttering into the air for
		 a good vantage point, blasted both halves with a gout of fire, setting them aflame.
		-Things rapidly devolved into chaos, with the ooze getting split futher, one blob swallowing
		 D'Roc for a bit, and, tragically, one blob swatting Maya's very brave little pet dragon out
		 of the air, where it fell limply into a stream of water.
		-Fortunately D'Roc managed to very messily burst out of the filthy thing, though he looked
		 pretty badly worse for the wear.
		-Also delightfully, Jade managed to fish the tiny dragon from the water and Bruce ran over
		 to minister to the critter's wounds.
		-After that, D'Roc wisely stood back, hurling handy boulders at the things instead, while
		 Maya and Grimble more metaphorically hurled eldritch energies their way, and soon the ooze
		 was. . . well, at least no longer mobile.
	-After that, we saw to setting up our ambush.
		-Maya and I spent some time getting her made up to look like a _very_ convincing drow,
		 figuring that might come in handy.
		-I then identified some useful fighting positions while Jade and D'Roc began setting up
		 various traps.


TODO:
	-Dragon-lightning elemental friends as followers?
	-Skill spending (remember tricks are once per encounter!):
		-Those other skill tricks, possibly before Jump.
	-Items:
		-Buy the +3 Cloak of Resistance Sarge is selling, for Grimble? It would be 4,500 gp.
			-It's half your available cash. . . but you _did_ lose him to a bad save once already.
			-Ah. He's still waiting on the replacement, but will then let me know.
		-A (better than +1, now) Ring of Protection: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ring_of_Protection
			-Your saves are good now, so you need to boost your AC.
			-Jade won't be able to craft rings until level 14 or so.
		-Get Jade to craft at least a masterwork rapier for you.
			-She now even has Craft Magic Arms and Armor.
		-Chris had some bow ideas: https://discord.com/channels/@me/838577998269120522/1207089795155886120
		-Something to deal with undead?
			-Maybe a specific wand?
		-Dex boosts too, though maybe the runner up behind Charisma.
			-I've already got the +2 gloves of Dex.
		-Buy an alchemist's lab for Grimble, to keep aboard ship?
			-Description: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Alchemist%27s_Lab
			-Eh, sounds like it's the MW Tool, with the description there saying it's safe to assume
			 tools suitable to avoid a penalty are available.
			-Maybe worth getting eventually, but not urgent.
		-Slippers of Battledancing would be amazing, for 33,750: https://www.imarvintpa.com/dndlive/items.php?ID=3184
			-Would mean giving up the talking boots, maybe to Grimble, to protect my little buddy. . .
			-Might push me towards hand crossbows and the like. . .
			-Cost for Jade to craft it: 16,875*.75 = 12656.25 + 1,350 XP.
				-Can she manage the 5 in Perform (Dance) somehow?
		-When can I get +5 to Charisma? The tome: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Tome_of_Leadership_and_Influence
			-Hiring someone to cast Wish seems about as expensive, and maybe less readily available:
				https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Wish
				https://www.enworld.org/threads/cost-for-npc-to-cast-a-spell.207095/
			-Cost for Jade to craft it (requires CL 17, however that works for her):
				-6,250*.75 = 4,687.5 gp. + 25,500 XP
					-Jade's Extraordinary Artisan means a 25% gp. reduction.
					-Aside from that, that's the weird cost listed in the DM's Guide, probably due
					 to Wish having an XP cost and being involved.
					-That XP cost might not be worth it if paying for it is an option. . .
						-It's greater than the difference between levels 19 and 20.
	-Ship weapons:
		-Finish cannon refurbishment, given that incoming bone fortress.
			-They'd be great for use with followers!
				-At 100 gp. per shot (1/3 that, if crafted), in powder cost alone, that's pretty
				 expensive for follower pot shots at anything but other ships.
			-They're in working order now, and just need smoke powder, which Grimble can make.
				-It's retails for 25 gp. per pound, or a third of that in materials, if crafted, and
				 it's 4 lbs. per shot with the light bombards.
				-Stormwrack pg. 104 has the details, and doesn't list a Craft DC but just says it can
				 be created by anyone with 9 ranks in Craft (alchemy). So maybe an automatic succcess?
		-Jade mentioned kind of melee-attack-to-kinetic-energy device she could make if we returned
		 for those magically reflective deep crystals in The Underdark (see 4/15/24 notes).
		-Get some boulders on board the ship for D'Roc to throw too.
	-Maybe do something with our other airship too.
	-Host an event with that arms merchant. Search above for "weapon signing".
	-Figure out paying back that 10k in diamonds.
	-Offer Squee that infinite bottle of rum? Can't _kill_ him, but can keep him _senseless_ for
	 eternity. . .
	-More dance numbers.
	-Recruiting followers!
		-You're keeping track of them in a Followers tab on the spreadsheet.
		-Dread Pirate will double them at it's 10th level.
		-Some kind of "air bike" concept seems attractive, small 1 or 2 man airships.
			-Perhaps alchemically armed? A swarm of these things hurling alchemist fire seems like
			 a major threat to airships.
		-(DONE) The air elemental running your ship?
			-What _would_ level adjustement for an elemental look like?
				-None listed, though could perhaps look at HD, if Jake allows it?
					-Small through Huge air elementals are 2, 4, 8, 16 HD.
			-I think you do speak Auran, for more or less this reason.
			-Relevant sources we could potentially adapt:
				https://dndtools.net/feats/planar-handbook--79/planar-familiar--2172/
				https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions/animal-companion-archetypes/elemental-companion-animal-companion-archetype/
				Complete Mage pg. 33 has the Elemental Companion alternate class feature for Druids
		-(DONE) Those gnome mimes you met Sharaar Kol.
			-They're a blast! Totally your kind of people.
			-They'd also provide a possible background for your hypothetical gnome illusionist
			 cohort.
				-Yep, Grimble, your cohort, was one of them.
			-Others as followers?
		-Fey? You met some in a well behind Jade's orphanage. Could be a blast. . .
		-(DONE!) Squee and the other two goblins as followers?
		-Rusty as a follower?
			-Nah, he's working for Jade.
		-If I can _customize_ something, maybe a Marshal? Flavored as a ship's officer, one with
		 the Wisdom check-and-skill bonus?
			-Or even, with more than one level, the Major Aura too?
			-Or that Dex check-and-skill _and initiative_ bonus?!? Maybe for a second follower?
	-What do you report, if ever called to do so by those that set you loose with the skyship?
		-Sasserine:
			-Turmoil in the church of Nkisi.
			-Substantial resistance to the current government, and a high degree of corruption.
				-Perhaps an opening for The Brotherhood?
			-Low saturation by the fruits of Edric (never saw an adamantine weapon, etc.).
			-Interesting metal working technology, used to create ultra-light mail.
			-Evidence of a follower of Enilias operating, masquerading as a follower of Shawn.
				-Now dead, but still interesting.
			-Found an illithid skull in the caverns beneath Sasserine's noble district, where they
			 were making the were-sharks. Very much Ed's area of interest.
		-Sharaar Kol:
			-Shit, that river-brain-thing is probably right up Edric's alley.
				-We think we left it encased in rock, where the magic river used to be before that
				 wild magic planar swap happened.
            -There was some other mind-control-y shit down there too, like the rats.
				-Both they and the brain felt like psionics.
			-A river of magic isn't really his domain, but it _is_ something he'd be plenty happy
			 to _consume_. If that can be worked into items. . .
				-It might now be on the plane of Celestia.
			-The Quickhammer organization:
				-Seems to indicate a demand for fake or shoddy goods exists. Potentially something
				 exports from Edric's domain could take advantage of (being a source of cheap goods)
				 or preempt (being capable of extraordinary workmanship and materials).
			-The king is angry at the high priest of Moradin.
		-Earth's End:
			-A trading post in The Underdark we have the location of, with an existing portal to
			 The Elemental Plane of Earth.
			-Also near some psionically (and magically) resonant crystals and fungus.
		-The Brotherhood:
			-There's that orb Jade has, tied to keys to The Brotherhood's planes. More below.
			-A fairy within Nkisi's realm traded a key to that realm to another fey (see 3/22/23
			 notes for more details).
		-Party Members:
			-To-Cao:
				-He is an uncommonly capable Thri-Kreen, possessed of combat techniques uniquely
				 well suited to his species, and you've seen others of his kind around Edric's
				 plane. His knowledge would likely be useful to his fellows in Edric's orbit.
				-He is also now probably dead.
			-Maya:
				-She seems to have some connection to the dragon god Bahamut, with him serving as
				 her patron. Isn't Shawn connected to him in some fashion too?
				-Her noble family, headed by her father, are moneychangers in Sasserine, a thing
				 that may offer a point of leverage to an entity that can crash specie markets more
				 or less at will.
				-She also seems to have designs on becoming queen of Sasserine.
			-Sarge:
				-Sarge apparently wasn't always a dragon-man, but was actually once a cat-man. Such
				 transformations are kind of Edric's thing.
			-Jade:
				-An artificer, the service of which is always of interest to Edric.
				-She has several keys, to realms of The Brotherhood, and a strange orb that they
				 slot into, with some apparent arcane significance.
					-One key I'm unsure of.
					-One tied to Nkisi's realm.
					-Edric's now too.
			-D'Roc:
				-A follower of Dog.
				-Seems to be half minotaur, a rather interesting bloodline.
			-Skye Nightwarden:
				-A follower of Nkisi.
			-Lucien:
				-Kin to both devils and angels.
				-Knows interesting booze.
		-Items:
			-The Crystal of Lost Time (10 minutes = 1 day of work for 1d4 Con damage).
				-Totally Ed's kind of thing, a magic crystal that can be used for efficient production.
				-Ah, I think Jade and Maya later gave it away to Zyrastra.
				-Still, can it be kept from a _god_? Maya's father also had a magic stone that took
				 him to Zyrastra wherever they were, and could have more. . .
			-Oh! Jade has a new crystal now: The Crystal of Chaotic Good Time Dilation (name pending?):
				-First 10 minutes = Fatigued, then Exhausted after another 10, and useless until
				 some rest or other means of curing those states.
		-You might have burned some bridges with Edric there now, obviating some of this, but still
		 not the worst thing to have in your back pocket.
	-Do we have a treasure map? Search "a treasure map" above!
	-Skull of a giant descended from the one that banished Martek, to allow him to return to The
	 Material Plane.


TODONE:
	-(DONE!) Buy more spells for Grimble!
		-Shit, they're not only expensive, but crazy time consuming to copy: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicOverview/arcaneSpells.htm
		-Also a nasty Spellcraft check.
		-Confirmed an emporium in Sasserine has everything I want, so now I just need time.
		-(DONE!) Hmm. . . Can Grimble borrow that time acceleration item?
			-The Crystal of Lost Time (10 minutes = 1 day of work for 1d4 Con damage).
				-Hmm. . . there's potentially other consequences. Grimble used it for Fireball, had
				 to make a Will save, and, though he rolled excellently, he still flickered in and
				 out of existence, saw second long snapshots of other planes. Hate to think what
				 might have happened had he failed. . .
				-Ah, I think Jade and Maya gave it away to Zyrastra (grumble): https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/560915739796570119/1179609124766498876
		-Also, anything we can do to buff his Spellcraft?
			-Eh, needing it for 24 hours makes that tough without using an item.
	-Maybe get some arrows of other materials?
		-Definitely silver, given the Shapers.
	-Upgrade to a longbow. Marshal gave you the proficiency.
		-Composite Longbow (Str +1) for 200? Or a masterwork one for 500?
	-You pretty desperately need a Handy Haversack: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Handy_Haversack
    -Appraise "your" airship. You need something worth at least 10,000 gp. for Dread Pirate.
        -You rolled like shit, but it's at least 20k new, enough to become a Dread Pirate.
	-Get a masterwork buckler, to eliminate it's skill penalty.
	-Your cohort!
		-Originally, you'd planned on a gnome illusionist, with some vague plan of he being
		 someone you knew from your childhood on Edric's plane.
			-Mimes might provide an alternate background for that character.
		-What, though, does Lesley's absence and To-Cao mean for this?
			-Would be a bit unwieldy to manage three characters.
			-To-Cao would be a solid cohort too.
			-The big question, I guess, is what Lesley's plans are, how much he'll be around, etc.
	-Roll up more Quickhammers before word spreads too much.
		-The ~25 agents in Sasserine.
	-Harness for cohort.
	-Hunt more Shapers, with the information from our interrogation above.
		-Possibly quickly, given the limited time we have remaining before the festival, and maybe
		 the bonefortress's arrival.
	-Collect potions and bounties.
	-Once you get Leadership, what cohort should you get?
		-Moved discussion of this into Skypirate.txt
	-(DONE) Concentration improvements:
		-Light reading suggests that Psi-Like abilities are no different then normal manifesting
		 when it comes to dispensing with displays: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/psionicPowersOverview.htm
		-Jade maxes Concentration, so can craft you an item boosting it.
			-Custom cost:
				Skill bonus (competence):	Bonus squared × 100 gp
				No space limitation:		Multiply entire cost by 2
			-You'd be crafting it too, so you pay half that in gold, and 25th in XP:
				+2: 400 gp., 32 XP
				+3: 900 gp., 72 XP
				+4: 1600 gp., 128 XP
				+5: 2500 gp., 200 XP
				+6: 7200 gp., 288 XP
			-Remember there are factors in the item rules that can reduce cost too. . .
		-(DONE) OH! Even better, get an Eternal Wand of Undersong: https://dndtools.org/spells/spell-compendium--86/undersong--4650/
			-Jade can craft it in one day for 307.5 gp (820 gp * 0.75 * 0.5) and 32 exp: https://discord.com/channels/@me/838577998269120522/1207111809610547231
			-(It can!) Wait, can it last all day? Does Jade have limited ability to do the persist thing?
				-If not, maybe a regular wand is best.
				-Yes, it can: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1195829441683796118/1208967677826175078
	-(DONE) A Stone of Good Luck at 20k will be a big deal for you eventually.
	-(DONE) A Vest of Resistance would be wise too: http://mcdt2-dungeon.wikidot.com/item:vest-of-resistance
	-Talk to Jade about ship repair too, after pushing it hard on the way to Sasserine.
	-Do we still have that bottle of Rov-slime?
		-Seems like it. Maya interrupted that conversation.
		-Yep! Jake confirmed it. . .
	-5 ranks in Jump, for a useful skill and +2 to Tumble?
		-Oh! Jump offers the Extreme Leap trick, which is really good. Pretty much +10' movement
		 speed (once per encounter. . .).
			-Ah, but that's only a DC 10 with a 20' running start, which probably means the Run
			 action, as well as managing that much movement in a straight line.
				-Oh. No Run action needed, rereading that text. Just the 20' straight.
			-It's DC 20 without that, which is probably tough for you to hit consistently.
			-Oh! But extra movement speed from Haste gives you a +12 that makes that _very_
			 plausible.
			-Then, once Dread Pirate 8 lets you always take 10, it's guaranteed. . .
		-Took the ranks and now just need the skill trick (didn't have 2 skill pts. to spare).
	-People from Aborea(?) party as followers?
	-Buy stuff for new spells:
		-Jade dust for Programmed Image:  https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/programmedImage.htm
		-Alchemist Fire (or make it!) for Firebrand: https://dndtools.net/spells/spell-compendium--86/firebrand--4502/
	-Charisma boosting stuff is a huge deal for you, between skills and power DCs.
		-Chris did the calculation to go from +4 to +6: https://discord.com/channels/560915739796570113/1027415547278794782/1360112203407294505
			"Cloak of Charisma +6 is 36000 gp, assuming Fred has got a +4 Cloak at 16000 gp I think he'd need to pay the difference in crafting materials (so that's (36000-16000)x0.75x0.5= 7500 gp and 20000/25 = 800 exp, if my calculations are correct?)."


TODON'T:
	-Tiger time? See TODOs before 6/1/22.
	-Be ready to ask Edric or his people about diamonds? They're chump change to Ed, and could pay
	 that debt and/or pay to resurrect Grimble too.
