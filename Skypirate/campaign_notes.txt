12/29/21:
	-We're members of a scouting party sent out by The Brotherhood.
		-We were furnished with an airship and sent out to explore The Material, seeking wonders,
		 knowledge, and resources.
		-Larix serves as our helmsman, capable of communicating with the bound air elementals that
		 power the ship.
			-The hull is Edric-built, sailing forth from one of his enormous factory cathedrals, but
			 the service of the elementals was purchased.
			-The "engines" require regular castings of a spell to keep running. A common service, it
			 runs about 50 gp. for our ship, and our engines currently have two weeks of runtime
			 left.
		-Your individual tasking probably resembled this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalndXdxriI
	-After days over the ocean, we came to a kind of port city, newer spires surmounting ancient
	 machinery, and docks below, on the shores of the island this all stands on.
		-Low on supplies, and with Larix assuring us this at least wasn't actively hostile territory,
		 we decided to dock.
		-The city's name proved to be Sasserine.
		-It had recently undergone some kind of change in leadership, "the guilds" having "abandoned
		 the city", with The Dawn Council taking it's place.
			-Indeed, we saw several on the street bearing a sun emblem, along other badges: a
			 lighthouse surrounded by a dragon, a sword with a shield and helmet, a tiger with a
			 rose, and a spider and keep.
		-The city seems to be mostly human.
		-Ruins were frequently in evidence, broken bridges and the like, that seemed to indicate the
		 city had been rebuilt several times.
	-In paying the docking fee, we also heard about a job oppotunity, a lady offering work, and
	 requesting candidates meet her at her estate tomorrow evening.
	-In the meantime, we found a tavern, The Drunken Bear.
		-Talking with the barkeep, we learned more about Lavinia. Apparently she'd lost her family
		 in an airship accident, leaving just her and a sibling.
		-The barkeep also seemed none too fond of The Dawn Council, on account of new taxes.
		-She also told us of the city's seven districts:
			-The Champion District, with the arena and other entertainments.
			-The Merchant District, where we docked and were staying.
			-The Cudgel District.
			-The Sun District.
			-The Noble District.
			-The Azure District.
			-The Shadowshore, the one part of the city where the dawn can't reach. . .
		-We also rented a room there.
	-With time to kill, we also checked out the markets of The Merchant District, finding some
	 decent options for resupplying the ship.
	-Varani kept hiding his face when we passed those bearing the emblem of The Dawn Council.
		-I asked him what the deal was and he said someone he'd "rather not talk about" had paid
		 them to capture him.
	-We spent the night at The Drunken Bear.
		-During the early hours of the morning, Varani heard me mumbling in my sleep: "No! No more
		 ink blots. . ."
	-When we woke, Varani was gone.
		-Asking the barkeep, she left about two hours before I came down, and outside there was a
		 lot more Council activity. . .
		-Once Larix woke too, though, he consulted his hawk, who led us to a dead-end alley, and
		 Varani then descended from a hiding place atop some crates and beneath the eaves of a
		 building.
		-Apparently The Dawn Council is looking for her in force, hand she was unable to get back
		 to the bar after going for a run.
	-We decided to find a way to The Shadowshore, and lie low until our dinner tonight.
	-After some quick patches to an abandoned skiff, we took to the water, to cross the lagoon,
	 but opted instead to stop on a deserted, brush-and-trash-strewn island. It seemed a good 
	 hiding spot.
		-Not entirely deserted, as it turned out. I heard the sound of some voices speaking in
		 Goblin somewhere nearby.
		-I crept over and listened in. It seemed they were a party of scrappers, arguing over salvage.
		-Goblins seem generally _tolerated_, if looked down upon, so I decided we should leave them be.
		-There's bigger fish in the water tonight, and no sense showing up to a lady's house smelling
		 like we'd been rolling around in trash with goblins.
	-As the time came, we headed to our dinner.
		-After knocking, we were ushered inside.
		-A party of armored folks were exiting as we entered. Apparently Lady Lavinia has other
		 suitors. . .
			-Varani knew them as a group of mercenaries, "The Jade Ravens".
			-They were talking about being sent to the city of Cauldron, to the South.
		-As we spoke with Lady Lavinia, she spoke of money troubles, a vault beneath a castle, and
		 the two signet rings that can open the vault. Her father's is the only one available, but
		 it's aboard an impounded ship.
			-She paid the fine, but the man holding the ship claims to have never received it, and
			 she suspects he's up to something, aboard the ship.
				-Soller Vark is his name, and she suspects him of being a smuggler.
			-She asks that we recover her money, and, if possible, find out what he's doing aboard
			 the ship.
				-I haggled for 250 gp. in exchange for the task and she directed us to the ship.
	-Heading there, the ship proved not to be docked, but moored some distance out form the peer.
	-We opted to pretend to fish on our skiff, and keep an eye on ship until midnight at least.
		-No one came or went, and the deck was deserted save a sentry that came out from time to
		 time, but animal noises came from within the hold.
		-We tried climbing the anchor chain, but it. . . did not go well. I was able to play off the
		 noise as a drunk Varani falling while fishing, but we then had to row out of there as the
		 sentry shoed us off.
		-We opted to return another night.


1/12/22:
	-Returning to our own ship to spend the night, given the goons looking for Varani near the inn,
	 we debated our strategy.
	-We didn't come up with anything better, though, and Varani claims she's not normally that clumsy,
	 so we opted to keep watch over the ship for another day, and attempt boarding again after
	 nightfall if we don't catch someone leaving the ship.
	-A little while into the morning, we boarded our skiff and headed out onto the bay to watch the
	 ship.
		-Near nightfall, the ship headed in toward the dock it had been tied to, some distance out.
		-We followed, and as we neared the ship, we could hear them shouting about making the ship
		 ready for departure.
		-We beached the skiff and hurried towards the dock, Larix employing his shapechanger
		 heritage to disguise him as one of the crew.
			-Ducking behind a crate, he tried to hide to cast a spell, summoning a mist to give the
			 rest of us some cover.
			-He was caught in that, but his disguise worked, and he was shoed aboard the departing
			 ship.
		-Varani then tried playing it cool, carrying a random crate aboard, while I crouched behind
		 one still on the docks.
		-Didn't go too well, though. A sentry questioned her, and she then dropped the crate and ran
		 aboard.
		-Well, there's my distraction, so I attempted to sneak aboard myself.
		-Varani threw a punch at one of the thugs, and a brawl ensued.
		-Larix tried his spell again, calling up the mist, but at least one of the sentries began
		 pointing and shouting at him as he did so.
		-With the shit kicking off, I ran into the now-present fog, towards someone shouting from
		 the upper deck on one end of the ship.
			-Hmm. . . I may lie to the lady about what went down here. "Some fight with criminal
			 rivals, no doubt. . ."
		-Hearing some commotion nearby, I crept up on someone stomping around in the fog, only to
		 trip over a length of rope abandoned on deck. Someone began shouting at me to keep back,
		 so I stabbed into the fog with my rapier, but didn't connect with anything.
		-Things went pretty far South. After another vain fog-stabbing, and a legit me-stabbing, I
		 ran the fuck away, back onto the dock and ducking behind a crate..
		-These aren't good odds. I figured I might be able to buy some time, though, and set about
		 sabatoging the ramp running from ship to dock, wedging a stake found on the dock into the
		 rotating mechanism it was locked into. Now, as the ship moved with the waves, it squeals,
		 and probably won't be easily undone.
		-I then made my way towards the seaward end of the ship, where the anchor chain and the
		 docking rope were, aiming to sabatoge those too.
			-I had to take it slow, though, darting from cover to cover, having seen thugs
			 brandishing crossbows on the ship.
		-Meanwhile, the commotion in the fog seemed to intensify. There was some kind of metalic-
		 sounding shrieking, as if from something breaking, and then running and thuds.
		-I got to the anchor and, seeing the quick-release lever for it's winch, leaned over onto
		 the ship, and pulled it, dropping the anchor. I then darted back, further down the dock,
		 and behind some crates.
		-Now there were _screams_ coming from the ship, and someone yelling, "It's free! It's free!
		 Abandon ship!"
		-In short order, one of the sailors ran down the ramp and onto the dock. Another even lept
		 down from the poop deck, but landed badly and wasn't moving.
		-I sheathed my rapier and then ran up to the one by the ramp, shouting, "I heard the
		 commotion! What's going on here? Do you need help?"
			-He responded with jumbled, panicked shouting, saying something about "the fog" and "It's
			 loose!"
			 "What's loose?!?"
			 "Fuckin' spider thing!"
		-More crew fled the ship, and eventually the fog cleared, revealing Larix and a horrible
		 spider-thing, with waving. . . tendrils.
		-The monster didn't seem hostile towards Larix, though, exhibiting a kind of deference to
		 him as he spoke to it in a language I did not understand.
		-This chaos had caught the attention of a couple of guards, who were running towards the
		 monster (and visibly pissing it off).
		-I rushed to intervene, shouting, "Guards! These men have been smuggling monsters into the
		 city, aboard their hired ship! My friend has control over it for the moment, but you must
		 apprehend them!"
		-They seemed to buy it, and Larix tried to convince them to back off, that he had it under
		 control, but they instead shouted something about putting it out to sea, and tried to undo
		 the ramp (that I sabotaged).
		-That pissed the spider-thing right off, though, them approaching. Larix tried to calm it,
		 but to no avail, and it grabbed the guards with it's tendrils, shaking them to death.
		-It then looked over back at Larix, like a dog proud of the bird it caught as the limp
		 guards dangled from it's tendrils.
		-Larix asked that I help him get one of the ship's boats overboard. I lowerd it with it's
		 winch, and then he coaxed the beast overboard, and into it, rowing out into the bay.
			-While doing it, I asked him where Varani was, and he said he saw her breath her last.
		-Meanwhile, we saw some further off guards apprehend Soller, at least, and a few of his men.
		 With the boat in the water, I went over to tell our story.
			-As I approached, Soller was receiving some rough treatment. It seems he was known to
			 them, as one said to another, "This thug has been evading us for a long time. He's off
			 to the dungeons."
				-Another also mentioned something about having aprehended about half of the men they
				 saw fleeing.
			-I volunteered that we were here as agents of the ship's owner, having heard unsavory
			 things about what was going on aboard. We were here to investigate, having boarded the
			 ship only to hear shouting and chaos from below, apparently their smuggled monster
			 getting loose.
				-They were willing to accept that, and to let us take control of the ship. I didn't
				 mention the owners name, but the guards did ask _my_ name. Too proud to do otherwise,
				 I told them Fredrick had this under control, and that I'd let the ships owner know
				 her property had been secured.
		-A short while later Larix returned, wounded, but saying the monster was now free and outside
		 of the city.
		-I let him know we'd met with great success. He agreed, stating he had the ring and a pouch
		 of coin too. The ring had a strange note tucked inside it.
		-With the ship secured, I searched it further, while he kept watch.
		-I then went in search of a runner, and paid him to go fetch Lady Lavinia.
		-A short while later, she indeed arrived, at the center of a party of hired guards.
			-One of those guards stood out, with spiked hair and wearing flowing robes.
				-We later learned his name was Forcas (Lesley's new character).
			-I called down to her, saying that we'd recovered the ring, fee, and boat all!
			-She was elated, though I also had to add that it was not without cost, as Varani did
			 not make it.
				-"We'll of course need to take her share to her family," I bluffed, to which the
				 lady agreed.
	-She had her guards take control of the ship, and asked us to join her in her hired carriage, 
	 where she spoke of further work, on retainer.
	-First, though, she wished us to come with her to her family's vault, in the city's fortress,
	 which the signet ring is key to.
		-To collect our pay, she said, though she also mentioned the vaults had some kind of
		 security, and that she'd like "seasoned adventurers" with her.
	-We traveled a mile or so across the city, and then took a ferry to the fortress's island.
		-It was a looming, forboding thing.
		-We unlocked her family vault, and it would see her fears were not unwarranted as some kind
		 of metallic cobra slithered out from the shadows within.
		-Forcas quickly lept at it, pummeling it with his fists and elbows.
		-I, meanwhile, stepped back, in front of the lady, and manifested my Force Screen.
		-We then took turns failing to harm it, while Larix summoned a wolf.
		-Larix eventually noticed it was lunging at everyone _but_ Lavinia. He pointed out as much,
		 suggesting it was another thing keyed to the ring.
		-She brandished the ring, and it soon backed off, slithering into some kind of hole.
		-Venturing into the next room, it was covered in various panels depicting different monsters
		 in threatening poses.
			-None matching the ones on the note, though. Hmm. . .
			-In the center, a piller stood, with a star emblem around it's top with one marked spike.
			 It was possible to rotate it, pointing the marked spike at the different images.
			-They _did_ each have a different number of eyes, though, I noticed. Once I pointed that
			 out, we turned the pillar to point to one eye, two eyes, etc., until, with the last,
			 the panels opened, revealing a vault behind each.
			-Most were empty of all but a few scattered coppers on the floor, but one contained
			 several still-full chests, and a bunch of paperwork.
			-We were paid out from that.
				-500 gp. to Larix and I (two shares each, due to Varani's share and Forcas's asceticism).


TODO:
	-(DONE) Level up to 2!
	-Write up the loot in some fashion.
		-Figure out the Fantasy Grounds party sheet inventory?
			-Varani's loot is in there.
		-(DONE) Or just do another spreadsheet?
			-Yeah, we decided to just to that, as only the DM seems to be able to do much with the
			 Party Sheet thing.
			-You and Joe recorded all cash already.
			-You created the spreadsheet and posted it. 
		-(DONE) You probably want to use some of that gear too.
			-Buckler?
			-Consumables?
			-Yep, both of the above. You put your name on stuff in the sheet, now update Roll20.


1/26/22:
	-As we left the vaults, Lavinia asked the clerk if anyone else had recently been in her family's
	 vault.
		-After checking his records, the clerk responded that one Vanthus Vanderborn had been inside
		 less than a month ago.
		-Lavinia reacted with surprise, saying, "My brother? He's been missing! He was her? Where did
		 he go?"
		 "We do not keep records of where our visitors go from here."
		-I started to ask about her brother but Lavinia said, "Not here. It's a long story, and
		 painful. . . Return with me in the coach, to my mansion, and we will discuss it further."
	-Back at the mansion, her gnomish servant greeted the lot of us, and also informed the lady that
	 she had a visitor, one Jade Shadowfeather (Shroud's artificer).
		-We each grabbed a drink, and then went to a sitting room, where Jade waited.
		-There, she told us the story of her brother.
			-Once extremely close, her brother has been missing for more than a month. Though
			 apparently he was close enough to empty the vaults. . .
			-The two of them had been separated for 5 years, after some youthful trouble, her sent
			 to a finishing school, and him to the family's country house.
			-Upon their return to the city, their rapport was gone, and he was behaving strangely.
				-He spent his days shut up in his room, only leaving at night, to go out into the
				 city, bringing back. . . disreputable men.
				-Eventually, he struck out on his own, leaving the family's home.
				-Some time after that, their parents' accident occurred. He returned for a bit, then,
				 but behaved worse and worse, eventually striking his sister, after which she cast
				 him out of the house.
	-She then raised the prospect of that further work: finding her brother, and bringing him back
	 to the mansion, to talk some sense into him.
		-Asking her what she knew of his whereabouts, she said he'd not been seen in the Noble
		 or Champion districts, where they have many friends, but that she'd heard he may have been
		 involved with a woman in the Azure district.
		-We agreed to aid her in this, and she, drinking heavily through the whole story, was soon
		 off to bed while we made our introductions to Jade.
	-I proposed we start with the mansion's servants. She'd said it they'd mentioned strange behavior
	 on his part, and maybe there's more to that then they wanted to tell his sister, the lady of the
	 house.
		-Talking with them, the reinforced the lady's narrative, and also mentioned many of his
		 companions sharing an odd tattoo, a hooded snake, though they didn't see the whole thing
		 on any of them, as it was invariably covered partly by clothes.
	-Larix then raised the matter of the hastily bandaged lacerations, and we asked after rooms in
	 the mansion for him to rest.
		-Jade remained with hime, while Forcas and I set out into the Azure district, to see what
		 the word on the street was, if anyone was talking about the snake-tattoo folks, or a noble
		 slumming it.
		-After a short bar crawl, we ran into a couple of folks who seemed to recognize our
		 description of Vanthus.
			-They all mentioned he'd been seen with Brisa Santos, a notorious pick pocket turned
			 artist. Neither had been seen in the district in most of a month, though.
			-We asked if they knew where she stayed, and one said, "Probably in those froofy artist
			 lofts that are popping up all over The Shadow Shore since the area started cleaning up."
		-So, that's the direction we headed.
			-There, Forcas spotted a couple of folks with the snake tattoos.
			-We saw one leaving a bar, and stepped inside, to ask about the man who wore it.
			-We learned from the bartender that the man, name unknown to him, was a regular, and
			 pissed that one Penkus, also a regular, owed him money, and hadn't been seen in some
			 time.
		-After I finished a strong ale, we headed back to the ferry, to worry about the rest of this
		 with the others in tow.
	-I took a moment after waking to talk Forcas into schlepping my junk about for me ("You look
	 strong. It's kind of even an act of charity!").
		-Good bye, encumbrance!
	-We headed back to The Shadow Shore the next morning, in search of Penkus, or at least someone
	 who knows who he owed money to.
		-We ran into a friend of Penkus in a restaurant nearby. He mentioned that he'd last seen
		 Penkus on a boat, a pleasure craft named It Still Floats, owned by a pessimistic dwarf
		 named Panchi. Penkus and Panchi had been arguing about something when this guy left for
		 the shore.
		-We stopped by Panchi's shop.
			-Apparently Penkus had rented It Still Floats, loaded it with lamp oil, lanterns, and
			 rope and then headed West.
			-Further, he was not alone, and had some "long haired, goateed noble" with him. . .
			-He requested that, if we see his ship, we send it his way, or at least salvage it's
			 enchanted propulsion.
	-We decided to take our ship to find that ship.
		-But first, we opted to stop by the Merchant district, to pick up some supplies for Jade to
		 craft me a rapier.
		-While in line at a stall, though, we noticed someone with a snake tattoo behind us in line.
			-I walked right up to him, asking him where he got the fancy tattoo, claiming I was, 
			 "Thinking of getting one myself, after seeing one on someone next to me in a Shadow
			 Shore bar."
			-Looking at it closer as I approached, though, it seemed. . . unfinished, or maybe fake.
			-He dodged that question, and instead launched into a pitch for some kind of party, if
			 we'd pay him the entrance fee.
				-Some kind of island art gallery experience shit, though, he eventually also
				 mentioned something about, "Smuggling the art back into the city. You'll be rich!"
				-What piqued my interest was his mention of the artist, Vanthus.
				-He also introduced himself as Chefton.
				-Well, I guess we're playing along with this harebrained scheme.
	-We boarded _his_ ship instead, and we sailed to a nearby island.
		-It had high cliffs surrounding it, save for a narrow beach.
		-After beaching the ship, he led us to a door in the cliff face, indicating that the
		 "exhibit" was inside.
		-He was reluctant to go in himself, but Forcas beat me to insisting, and he eventually
		 complied and led us inside.
		-Inside only a short while, though, the door was slammed behind us, with clearly-Vanthus
		 laughing and shouting from outside, "You actually fell for it?!? Did my sister send you?"
		-It was followed by the sound of rocks falling outside the door, which no longer budged.
		-Chefton, meanwhile, was shouting back, "You bastard! You trapped me in here with them!"
		-After some nicer-than-I-would have been questions from Forcas, Chefton said something
		 about these being old smuggling tunnels.
		-Well, fuck it, lets see where these go.
		-To half-flooded tunnels full of zombies, it turns out!
		-That. . . went poorly, and now Larix is dead from a thorough zombie gnawing.
		-Forcas was down too, but the bleeding had stopp, so Jade wracked her brain for stuff she
		 could throw together to heal him.
			-It took a couple of minutes and lots of improvising, but she managed to put together an
			 enchanted trinket that healed a few of his bites, getting him back on his feat.
		-I'd seen a fair amount of the tunnels, as I boldly scouted ahead for an escape route during
		 the fight. During that, we spotted a body in a pool of water.
			-We debated fishing it out, and it did have a fancy looking dagger strapped to it's belt.
			-There were some fierce looking crabs in the water, though, so we figured it would be
			 best to rest a bit before we risk provoking them.
			-Before resting, though, Jade wanted to try another healing trinket. However, as she was
			 assembling it and mumbling incantations, it exploded on her, and she went down, bleeding.
			-Well, shit. Forcas and I frantically tried to staunch the bleeding, and he was eventually
			 successful.
			-We dragged her back to the entry room, to hole up with Chefton while we rested a bit.
			-He was a despondent mess, unresponsive as Forcas called him over to help drag Jade, but
			 Forcas slapped him around until he helped.
			-We rested a while, and Jade eventually woke up.
			-I also eventually noticed a change in the sound of the lapping water, and I suspected
			 that low tide may have arrived, perhaps aiding in our escape from this place.


TODO:
	-Come back to that floating corpse.
	-Chat up Chefton, to Diplomacy-adjust his attitude towards us.


2/10/22:
	-As I did more looking into our predicament, examining the shaft by which we entered this place,
	 I felt a familiar presence, watching me. . .
	-I returned to the room where the rest of us rested, to alert the others to this, only for my
	 report to be interrupted by the miraculous appearance of a priest.
	-He introduced himself as Isaias, a follower of Shawn. Sounds like The Brotherhood thought we
	 needed rescuing.
		-I asked him if he could teleport us out of here, but he said no, it was a one-way trip.
		-I also said it sounds like someone doesn't like him, being teleported here just to be
		 trapped same as us, but he said it was his "chance to prove myself."
			-Me: "Tests, eh? I know all about tests. . ."
	-With him now with us, we returned to the room we fought those zombies in, to check on the water
	 there (and check the pockets of that floating corpse).
		-The water level had indeed dropped with the tide, but not so far as to leave any unflooded
		 opening.
			-Jade was weirdly willing to blindly swim an underwater tunnel, but I wisely suggested
			 we look through the rest of the place first.
		-I walked over to the pool, hoping I could snag the corpse with my bowstave, but a monstrous
		 crab emerged from the pool snapping at me, soon joined by several more.
		-I and the wounded Forcas got the hell out of there, retreating to the back of the room, but
		 the priest proved a real fanatic, and ran at them brandishing his weapon.
			-He soon had crabs hanging off him.
		-Crabs are apparently not confused by summersaults, but I can at least out run them. I tried
		 to kite one of the crabs, with mixed success.
		-In less than a minute, though, all the crabs were seafood, and none of us were pinched to
		 death!
	-Afterwards, Forcas immolated the human bodies in the room, "To give them a dignified end."
		-I asked if it was sacrilegious to also "immolate" the crab remains!
		-Turns out not, so we spent the next hour or so on a crab feast.
		-I even called Clifton over, and offered him some.
			-Chatting with him for a bit, he seemed to be warming up to us, but still despondent
			 about how he ended up down here, and not very hopeful about escape.
		-During this time, though, the pool of water began to rise again.
	-Following the feast, we examined the door to the West (shit, should have chosen the rhyming
	 East!).
		-Neither I nor the cleric of apparently unusual abilities noticed any traps, but he did
		 did say he heard through it the moaning of the damned-and-undead.
		-Well, despite our previous zombie disaster, with a priest by our side we felt a bit more
		 confident, and I boldy let Isaias go first.
		-That confidence in Isaias seemed well placed, as the zombies fled before the holy symbol
		 he brandished.
		-The passage they fled down was flooded not far past the door, though. It wasn't deep, but
		 it _was_ pulsing with the waves, and slippery, so it proved slow and treacherous going.
		-Too treacherous for Forcas, as it turned out. His repeated failures led to him nearly
		 drowning in a foot or two of water, with Jade and I stuck behind his flailing form in the
		 narrow corridor.
		-Yep, whole thing was a disaster. All of us fell a time or two, and are now resolved to
		 avoid that damned place until low tide again.
		-At least we managed to kill the zombies one by one, as they made their own way back out of
		 the surf towards us.
	-We opted to rest again, owing to the bruises all over Forcas and Isaias.
	-Eight or so hours later, we ventured out of our barricaded corridor.
	-It seemed now to be low tide, so we again braved the flooded corridor.
	-This time, it was a breeze, being mostly dry.
	-At the end of it, we found a room with the corpse of one Penkus, as identified by a vengeful
	 note clutched in his hand.
		-Apparently, Vanthus betrayed him too, trapping him here where he died a slow death from an
		 infected zombie bite.
		-It even told us where he makes his home, "in the lap o' th'Lotus, below th'Taxidermist's
		 Hall.
			-Penkus had a tatoo with a dragon twining around a flower, and the note seemed to

			 suggest that "the Lotus" is some kind of gang.
			-It also made reference to "the Lady of the Lotus" and Vanthus's "designs" on her.
		-Forcas even found a secret room, filled with genuine pirate treasure!
			-Various potions and other arcana, along with enough coins that we had to drag a sea
			 chest full of them with us.
	-Returning to the crab chamber, we checked the rest of it's doors.
		-Two led to closets, one of which had some useful scrolls at the bottom of some moldy old
		 supplies.
		-The third, though, was the series of rooms I'd previously run through, which we followed to
		 another door, leading away, rather than back to the entrance.
			-This one had the sound of more zombie groans coming from it, so we paused to prepare
			 (and for the end of the session.)


2/25/22:
	-We pawed through some of of loot, distributing useful items, before opening the door.
	-Suitably attired, we kicked in the door, revealing two zombies and some armored undead figure
	 who could manage complete sentences.
	-Isaias ran in, brandishing his holy symbol, but his god seems to have failed him as the zombies
	 were undeterred.
	-I had unwisely followed him down the hall, lunging at one of the zombies, only to miss.
	-When the zombie retaliated, swiping at me with his arm, I decided to make a strategic retreat.
	-Isaias was thankfully better with a dagger than a prayer, and between him and Forcas, one of the
	 zombies was soon looking rough (well, rough_er_).
	-It soon fell apart, and we moved onto the other undead creature, apparently a cleric from what
	 he was casting on his fellows in between harranguing us about "embracing death".
	-This one Isaias _did_ convince to flee with his holy symbol, prompting me to attempt to embed a
	 dagger in his back, but I missed as Forcas stuck a foot out and the cleric-creature went
	 sprawling.
	-Jade then finished him off with a crossbow.
	-Examining the cleric's holy symbol, Isaias deemed him a cleric of Olidammara.
		-I examined the symbol too, deeming it worth about 50 gp., for the weight of the gold.
	-The hallway ended in another pool of water, one Forcas was bold enough to wade into, looking
	 for another way out, and he emerged with some kind of shining orb!
		-Seems like it's somehow magical and, even better, likely valuable!
		-Isaias thought it might be tied to The Brotherhood.
		-Jade confirmed that, saying it's various divets were related to the keys to the various
		 planes of The Brotherhood.
	-A door off the halway led to a vile smelling room, containing a defiled alter.
		-Once dedicated to Olidammara, it was draped in dismembered corpses, perhaps a stage in the
		 cleric-zombie's conversion. . .
	-With that, we'd checked everywhere down here, and the flooded tunnel seemed our only bet for a
	 way out.
	-Well, I'm no swimmer, but _did_ have that Elixer of Swimming, so I chugged it while Forcas was
	 saying something about a rope.
		-After drinking it, I moved about in the water a bit, and seeing how I glided through it, I
		 volunteered to swim the tunnel trailing a rope in my hand, to aid the less elixed.
		-I got to the mouth of the tunnel, but caught myself on the spine of something in the coral
		 at the mouth. I could suddenly feel all that crab meat sitting poorly in my stomach, but
		 pushed through it, swimming up and breaching the surface of the water.
		-Around me, to my surprise, was Sasserine, I having emerged in one of it's rivers. An old
		 smuggling tunnel, perhaps.
		-I gave a tug on the rope, signalling the rest of the party to give it a shot, and Jade soon
		 emerged from the water too.
		-After that, though, the strands of red began to drift through the water. . .
		-I dove in, soon followed by Jade, to help what turned out to be a strugling Chefton,
		 bleeding from the coral.
			-We tried, along with some help from Isaias who followed Chefton down the tunnel, but
			 we were unable to drag him from the water.
			-Forcas eventually pushed him from the tunnel and swam up with him, but we were unable
			 to revive the poor bastard.
	-We were back in town at least. Probably don't want Vanthus or any of his gang realizing that,
	 though.
		-As such, we asked Isaias, who'd not been here when we left town, to go fetch some cloaks
		 to conceal us, and to find the nearest in.
			-Jade chimed in with a recommendation for the latter, saying there was actually one on
			 the nearby bridge.
		-We spent the meantime hiding beneath the bridge, hoping to stay out of sight.
		-While wringing out my bedroll though, I turned my back on Forcas and, when I turned back
		 around, he was gone.
			-Jade and I spotted him down the street, handing out coins to beggers. Fuck.
			-Well, _I'm_ staying out of sight, at least.
		-Isaias eventually returned with a set of too-nice-for-our-purposes cloaks.
			-He also came back with tales of the elven clothier offering some kind of "better
			 mithril", a kind of woven metal, that they were offering.
				-Light armor made from it would cost 1,500 gp. more than usual.
		-With his return, I _strongly_ suggested to Forcas that he perhaps sleep out on the street,
		 as he'd suggested instead of the inn, after all. People are bound to be following him after
		 that display. . .
			-He assented, arranging a time to meet us outside the inn.
		-Isaias then got he, Jade, and I rooms at the inn, which we entered cloaked.
	-After resting, we discussed our next course of action.
		-The three of us agreed that, well, Lavinia was paying us (some? all?), and had asked us to
		 report to her when her brother was found. Might as well do as she asked.
		-The estate was likely watched, though, so we again made Isaias our messenger (and ended the
		 session there).


3/9/22:
	-While we discussed our next move, a young elf unknown to us approached our table at the inn.
		-She remained silent for an awkward moment, looking us over.
		-Eventually, Jade asked, "Yes? Do you need something?"
		 "Yes. I think Lady Vanderborn sent me to find you.
		 "Oh?" I responded, "Did she tell you our names?"
		 "She did. She sent me in search of Forcas, Fredrick, Larix, and Jade, worried she'd not
		  heard from them in some time."
		 "Ah! Good to hear it! I'm Fredrick! Fred the Red, the call me."
		 "I'm Jade. Pleased to meet you."
		 "Forcas."
		-Well, that allays my suspicions somewhat, at least, since I don't think these Lotus jerks
		 ever heard our names.
		-She introduced herself as Kiani, and said she too was in Lady Lavinia's employ, sent at the
		 moment to check up on us.
		-We let her know we were waiting on an ally, sent as messenger to Lady Lavinia just moments
		 ago, and she asked if she could wait with us.
	-An hour or so later, Isaias returned, having met with Lady Lavinia.
		-He said she'd agreed her brother's crimes were dire, and gave us some amount of license to
		 deal with the matter ourselves, since the penalty the city's courts would likely hand down
		 would be death anyways.
		-He also said we might want to check on our ship, saying he'd heard the harbor master had
		 been killed, and that there'd been a "change of management".
			-In fact, Isaias also reported that law and order in the city appeared to be generally
			 breaking down, with criminal activity soaring.
	-Well, I, at least, am rather fond of that ship, and said as much. All agreed we should head
	 there quickly, though Isaias warned we should also come prepared, so we opted to unload our loot
	 and do some shopping.
		-At "The Tinker's Toolchest" we unloaded that junk, and perused some more, though nothing
		 really caught my eye.
	-We then headed down to the docks.
		-Along the way, someone sent us a very literal message, trying to tuck a note into Kiani's
		 pocket, though we caught the messenger.
		-No Lotus Dragon member, Kiani and Forcas gave him some gold in response to his sob story,
		 and also in exchange for information about where the message came from, describing a man
		 named Nemien at the taxidermist's guild.
		-As we approached the docks, we found them unusually empty, with almost no one out on the
		 street and the sounds of battle coming from somewhere above, amidst the airship docks.
		-It also sounded awfully windy up there, despite the day being otherwise calm.
		-As we approached closer, I could also hear words on the wind, in Auran: "Flee."
		-We speculated that a ship's air elemental may have gotten free, and pressed on, finding,
		 up top, several Lotus Dragon members in combat with some air elementals.
		-We joined that fun, picking off the busy gang members.
		-We made quick work of the gang members, with the last three surrendering to us.
		-When one of the air elementals turned and swung at Jade, I was able to convince them we
		 were friends, after the men they were fighting.
			-After the the remaining gang members surrendered, the surviving elemental and I spoke,
			 it telling a tale of escape from imprisonment in a crate, and it's desire to be free in
			 the air. We parted in peace.
		-The captives begged for their lives and freedom, which we demanded information in exchange
		 for it.
			-They were able to detail two entrances to the Lotus hideout: a trap door beneath a
			 chest in a backroom of the taxidermist guild and a passageway from beneath a pier.
		-With that info in hand, Forcas also insisted on one more concession: service. He insisted
		 that they join us aboard our ship, as sailors. Service to redeem them, and a way out of the
		 city where they're now in grave danger, after revealing their former comrades secrets.
	-We then headed to the taxidermist guild.
		-It was late by this point, and the front door was locked.
		-Looking below, for the entrance beneath the pier it sat on, we could see that the tide was
		 in, filling the area beneath with water.
		-Not confident of our swimming after the sea caves, I spent some time trying to pick the
		 front door, but a gang front uses an unsurprisingly good lock and I was unable to get the
		 door open.
	-We opted to return the ship, rest, and wait until the printed business hours.
		-During the night, though, we were woken by Forcas.
		-Apparently a relief party had arrived for the gang members we fought, and a disguised Isaias
		 had gone out to talk with them.
		-Isaias joined us a few moments later, saying he'd bought some time by telling them that
		 their comrades had gone in search of someone sneaking around the docks. He figured they'd
		 be back soon, though.
		-We set ourselves up in various locations, as an ambush.
			-We indeed managed to get the jump on them, routed them, and then picked them off as they
			 fled, to limit reporting back.


3/23/22:
	-We rested without any further gang members showing up.
	-The following morning, we debated how best to approach the gang's hideout.
	-With the tide lower this morning, we opted for the back door, and sent Isaias and Kiani to rent
	 a boat, their faces still being unknown to the gang.
	-They eventually returned to pick us up in a rented skiff.
	-There seemed to be lots of boats out on the water, and Kiani mentioned that some local fishing
	 contest was today.
		-Convenient, for our purposes. A good reason to be out on the water.
	-Rowing it over to the pier on which the taxidermy guildhall, we could see an iron gate closing
	 off a sea cave beneath it.
		-There was no mechanism for opening the gate from outside of it, though.
		-The bars are wide enough for someone to swim through, but that seemed like a bad idea even
		 before I spotted something shark-like swimming in the water on the other side of the gate.
		-Searching a while longer _did_ turn up some kind of keyhole in the gate, near the water
		 level, but fooling with it attracted the attention of one of the things swimming behind
		 the gate, which thrust a snapping maw up to the gate as I quickly pulled back my hand.
		-With it mere feet away on the othe side of the barrier, now, we figured we ought to take
		 some pot shots, though none hit.
		-That scared this one off, but several others rose, angry, in the water behind the gate,
		 chattering in some language unknown to us.
		-Uh oh. That might be the end of our surprise.
		-Jade named them Ixitxachitl, whatever the fuck that means.
	-Well, that door seems closed to us. Lets try the front.
		-We applied a few spells, and then strolled in the front door.
		-A man in the entryroom greeted us, introducing himself as Nemien.
		-I, in response, announced that we were famous hunters, in the area to do some hunting, and
		 looking to tour the facilities and see examples of the guild's work, to know who to bring
		 our business back to.
		-He agreed to the tour, and began leading us through the this reception area's interior door.
		-Stepping inside there, though, we heard another voice call out, from behind a door in the
		 next room, asking Nemien to come and speak with them, prompting Nemien to say the tour was
		 canceled after all, asking us to leave as he turned to go.
		-Forcas, with a frustrated expression on his face, announced that, "The time for talking is
		 over," and attempted to punch Nemien in the back of the head.
		-He stumbled while doing so, though, and the punch went wide.
		-Nemien, in response, cast a spell and disappeared, followed shortly by the door leading
		 further in opening and closing.
		-We rushed after him, and, as Forcas and Isaias burst through the door he'd passed through,
		 he revealed himself by casting another spell, to unknown effect.
		-Forcas, though, suddenly announced that, "What we're doing here is wrong." He then turned
		 to leave, pushing past us down the hall. . .
		-The rest of us were not so soft-hearted, though. I was still around the corner in the hall,
		 but I heard the thwang of Isaias's crossbow, and Nemien slumping to the floor.
		-I stepped past him as Isaias rifled through his pockets, but Forcas pushed him aside and
		 tried to staunch the flow of blood from Nemien's wound.
			-He seemed less like he's enscrolled, now, though, and more like he's being his self-
			 righteous self.
			-His medical skills weren't up to snuff, but he eventually resorted to pouring a potion
			 down Nemien's throat.
			-What followed, though, was reason enough to not consider Forcas _soft-hearted_ by any
			 means. Nemien woke up after the potion, but Forcas beat him halfway back to
			 unconsciousness while interrogating him.
			-He eventually revealed that there was a secret door in the hallway, leading to the 
			 gang's hideout.
			-Using a key on the ring Isaias took from Nemien, we got the door open while Forcas
			 slammed Nemien's head against a wall until he was unconscious.
	-Passing through the secret door and down a flight of stairs, we found ourselves in a dank
	 cave beneath the structure.
		-Some sentries greeted us through the first door with poisoned crossbow bolts, but we made
		 short work of them.
		-Moving past their corpses, we found ourselves in a maze of tunnels.
		-As we passed one door, we heard a gutteral voice within, complaining of lack of sleep.
			-Turning Isaias and Kiani, I asked, "Count of 3?" and then slowly pushed the door open.
			-Isaias and I each let fly with an arrow, while Kiani cartwheeled in between us, to stab
			 at the wolf-like beast within.
			-It was indeed the source of the voice. It grumbled more about just wanting a nap as it
			 snapped at Kiani's legs.
			-In short order, though, the beast lay bleeding out, with none of us having sustained
			 serious injuries.
		-From there, we followed the tunnels' various twists and turns, fighting the occasional
		 gangers, until we found the kitchen, where a cowering kobold cook pointed us in the
		 direction of Vanthus's room.
		-It proved well locked with a stout door, though, so we turned back to exploring the rest
		 of the tunnels.
		-We rescued a victim of torture, but Forcas was a jerk about the guy being reluctant to
		 discuss his undoubtedly shady business that ended up getting him extorted and eventually
		 tortured by the gang.
			-He shoved Kiani and we ended up beating him unconscious.
			-Forcas wouldn't let the matter of his line of work rest, though, and Kiani was now
			 pissed too.
			-They proceeded to torture the man, effectively waterboarding him.
			-In the course of that, he admitted he was actually a member of this gang, pretending
			 to be one of their victims. He was, in fact, the master of this torture chamber.
			-Well now I'm pissed at him too, since he's not an innocent smuggler or the like, but
			 rather one of the pricks that trapped us in that hole.
			-Forcas wanted to leave him unconscious but alive, to face eventual justice. However,
			 Isaias settled the argument by caving in his skull.
		-We never turned up the key to what's supposed to be Vanthus's room, so Isaias and I settled
		 in to very carefully attempt the lock we'd previously failed to pick.
			-Meanwhile, the others went off to examine a pool of water we previously passed by, and
			 returned a few minutes later with tales of a chained up crocodile.
			-Some 20 minutes later, Isaias and I finally got the lock open, and we entered the
			 room. . .


TODO:
	-(DONE!) Level up to 3.


4/20/22:
	-Over the course of opening the lock, we could hear. . . skittering, on the other side of the
	 door.
	-When the we got the lock open, I counted to three, threw the door open and ducked behind the
	 cover of the doorjamb and adjoining wall.
	-Forcas and Jade shot at something within as Isaias rushed forward, mace raised.
	-I drew my own bow and peeked around the doorway, seeing an enormous spider-thing, of the same
	 species those thugs on Lady Vanderborn's ship had been smuggling.
		-Not hesitating, I shot it right in one of its all too many eyes.
	-Another mace blow from Isaias and crossbow bolt from Jade solved the problem.
	-Isaias then rushed past it's still twitching corpse, chasing after some footsteps in the hall
	 beyond it.
	-I followed, finding Isaias battling a hulking goblinoid zombie. My arrow, though, shot over
	 Isaias's shoulder, didn't so much as slow it down.
	-While we fought the zombie, we heard a rasping voice shout. . . something, from behind a nearby
	 door. 
		-"We". I volunteered to "watch the rear".
	-The door then opened, revealing a reptilian humanoid who leaned forward and swiped at the zombie
	 with a clawed hand.
	-Soon, the zombie was down, and Isaias and Kiani were chatting with the creature.
		-"It wants to parley," Kiani reported.
		-"Does the wyrmtongue work?" I asked the creature.
		 "Yes. I can speak that too, but saw the elves among you."
	-The creature led us through a few more rooms and halls, to a meeting room in which stood a red
	 haired, jade eyed woman.
		-As we filtered into the room, she addressed us, saying, "Ah, _you're_ Lavinia's flunkies.
		 I'm Rowyn."
		-I responded first, saying, "I'm Fred, called The Red." The others followed with similar.
		-"What brings you to my aboad?"
		 "Well," I said, "You know our employer. Surely you know her brother?"
		 "Yes. . . he's a firebrand."
		-That elicited a snort from me.
		-"You've done some impressive work," she continued. "Work for me instead. With my connections
		 and your brass, we can take the whole city for ourselves."
		 "What of Vanthus?" I asked, "Won't he be jealous?"
		 "Jealous, yes. But he'll work with us nonetheless."
		 "Why would you work with someone like him?" Isaias asked.
		 "Isn't it obvious? He provides us with money, of course."
		-She then engaged in an increasingly shouty (on Forcas's part) moral debate with our monk.
			-She argued that obeying an unjust law was no crime, but he was characteristically
			 inflexible.
		-She quickly grew visibly tired of that and, eventually, interrupted Forcas saying, "Clearly
		 you don't know what's good for you. Gut Tugger? Get them!"
	-At that, the reptile thing promptly bit Jade's arm, while Rowyn broke into a song about a lucky
	 outlaw that they both seemed to enjoy.
		-I tried to shut her up, but my arrow struck the wall to her left.
		-Soon, the small chamber was filled with a wild melee.
		-Kiani seemed to recognize what this lizard thing is, and tried speaking further to it in
		 Elvish.
			-Not sure what she said, but it _did_ seem suddenly unsure of itself, taking a step back
			 from the fight.
		-Seeing that, Rowyn's singing faltered, and she instead grabbed a vial from her pocket,
		 downed it, and dissolved into a cloud of green smoke that began to drift towards the hall
		 we came through, moving towards a closed door next to Jade.
		-Forcas blasted her still gaseous self with a burst of luminous energy, also setting the door
		 behind her on fire.
		-That didn't stop her from slipping beneath it, though.
		-Meanwhile, Kiani, and now Isaias too, continued to talk with the lizard in elvish. It seemed
		 agitated, but was at least no longer trying to bite us.
		-Eventually, it handed Kiani a key, taking it from a cord around it's neck.
		-Forcas, Jade, and I raced after the gaseous Rowyn. Jade followed her to a door that turned
		 out to contain a bathchamber, but she'd apparently escaped through an air vent.
		-Returning to the meeting chamber, Gut Tugger was now rather cooperative, and had offered to
		 lead us to the gang's vault, which the aforementioned key opens.
		-He led us a bedroom, and showed us a keyhole concealed at the base of one of the walls.
			-While he was doing that, Kiani and I also rifled through the bedroom (Rowyn's?) fancy
			 perfumes, many of which were quite valueable.
			-We also found a journal, that seemed to belong to Vanthus Vanderborn. Reading through
			 it, he admitted to the murder of his parents, and discussed plans to commit a more ship
			 arson soon, which may be a clue to his whereabouts.
		-Kiani and Gut Tugger then got the hidden door open, though Gut Tugger held her back when
		 she tried to step inside, warning of a trap in the floor. He rushed in to open an empty
		 chest, saying it would disable the mechanism in the floor.
		-There were two more chests in the vault, which Gut Tugger said he did not have the keys to
		 them.
			-After the floor trap, we wanted to be cautious, and Isaias and I both carefully checked
			 the chests for more traps.
			-He claimed them clean, but I pointed out the trigger mechanism for a dart trap on each.
			-A comedy of errors then ensued, in which we both disabled a trap the hard way.
				-I was more confident of my skills and tried to disable the first one, only to get
				 a poison dart for my trouble.
				-Feeling queasy after that, I insisted Isaias take a turn. His luck was no better,
				 but _his_ dart was curteous enough to skip off his armor.
			-The traps at least sprung, Isaias and I took our time getting the locks open, but
			 eventually popped them.
				-One contained assorted loot, clearly from a variety of sources. Coins from many
				 nations, some filthy, some pristine.
				-The other, though, contains gems in bags labeled with the crest of House Vanderborn.
	-Gut Tugger, at least, we were rather happy with here. It and Kiani had a long conversation in
	 Elvish, and she reported that she would be arranging for him to take service with her parents.
	-We opted to rifle through the rest of the guildhall, to make sure we missed nothing more.
		-With Gut Tugger's help, we made short work of that, but there was little else of interest,
		 save four more of the spider monsters, in cages.
		-I thought they might be valuable to the right buyer, but didn't know where to find one and
		 wasn't about to set them free, so we left them.
	-Leaving the guildhall, we headed back to Lady Lavinia's estate.
		-Her housekeeper woke her while we waited.
		-When she joined us, I warned her she might want to sit down for this one and handed her the
		 journal.
		-Jade also brought up the matter of the gems marked with her family crest, eliciting a scowl
		 from me, and Isaias turned them over to her.
		-She was understandbly agrieved to learn her brother was responsible for the deaths of her
		 parents.
		-Her gnome housekeeper comforted her, while Isaias and Forcas both ranted about "the will of
		 the gods", the former aiming to comfort, while the latter shouted about their demand for
		 retribution here, probably canceling out the former.
		-She eventually thanked us for the return of her family's funds, giving us each a bonus of
		 a thousand gp. worth of the gems.
		-She also said that she would inform The Dawn Council about her brother's activities, and
		 of The Lotus Dragons' disarray.
		-Then, Lady Lavinia offered up her estate to us, to rest and recover from our wounds. We
		 spent several days there, recuperating.
	-Over the course of our rest, the council indeed investigated The Lotus Dragons' hideout, and
	 cracked down on them heavily.
	-Jade also took some time to try and track down the kobold that helped us. She thinks she found
	 work as a cook on a ship, but wasn't able to find her to actually speak with her.
	-Finally, towards the end of our week of rest, we received an invitation from The Dawn Council,
	 to a dinner in our honor at The Scarlet Embassy, and place the council maintains for such
	 functions.


TODO:
	-(DONE!) Blank the loot sheet before next session, once everyone has written stuff they claimed down.
	-(DONE!) Shopping! You've got a bit over 5k.
		-4k on Gloves of Dexterity would be a pretty obvious one for you: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gloves_of_Dexterity
			-Yep, and sounds like they're available at list price.
			-Added them to your sheet.


5/4/22
	-A bit of poking at your glamoured chain shirt proved it can indeed replicate any non-magical
	 clothing, including a noble or royal outfit (on your torso, at least). Ready for the ball!
	-I also got drunk with Kiani's lizard pet.
		-Apparently he hadn't tasted wine in a century.
		-Also apparently, he can drink like a champ.
		-We made a wild night of it, starting at the Vanderborn estate, and continuing on at a
		 tavern a dwarf with a four color beard recommended. Though I think he was just trying to
		 get with the bartender, the music was still good.
			-It's called "The Lusty Leper". Or maybe "The Lusty Leopard"? The dwarf's clarification,
			 "The one with the spots," didn't help much. . .
		-We drank with alchemists, Kiani got Gut Tugger a job as the bar's official party lizard,
		 and I name dropped our way out of guards wanting to shut things down due to a noise complaint.
	-Forcas, Isaias, and Jade eventually joined us at the bar, with Forcas saying something about
	 another event that needed livening up.
		-"Oh? Who died?"
		 "This dwarf's brother."
		 ". . . awkward choice of words on my part."
		-Still, I did my best to liven up a funeral, one which helpfully consisted of throwing the
		 deceased possessions into the sea (along with whatever else the drunk crowd following me
		 grabbed along the way).
		-Much drinking and littering ensued.
		-By the end of Isaias's sermon, I was getting more maudlin drunk, and announced, "Everyone I
		 grew up with is gone. . . Not dead, but gone all the same. . ." I followed that by throwing
		 my now empty road beer bottle into the sea.
		 "Yeah, didn't you lose the rest of your original party?" Isaias asked.
		 "Oh yeah, those guys died too. Get me another bottle!"
	-We eventually returned to the Vanderborn estate, a short while before dawn, and I awoke very
	 hung over, the following afternoon.
		-After talking the kitchen into making me a late breakfast of some eggs, Lady Vanderborn
		 also walked us through the expectations and protocols of The Dawn Council ceremony this
		 evening. It earned us each a free rank in Knowledge (Nobility & Royalty).
			-"There are _drinks_ at the party, right?"
			 "Of course," Lady Vanderborn replied, "Though there'll be more of that in afterparties
			 at the estates of various nobles. None here, likely, though, given the impact of
			 Vanthus's actions on our family's reputation."
		-The servents at the estate also bathed a reluctant Forcas at our urging. He cleans up OK,
		 but looked distinctly unhappy about the whole affair.
	-That evening, we all loaded into Lady Vanderborn's carriage, and headed to the party in our
	 honor.
		-It took us a bit to reach the front of a line of carriages winding through The Noble
		 District, but, once at the event, the guards ushered us inside.
		-Just inside the door, we were met by a man in garments emblazoned with a sunburst.
		-He introduced himself as Xavius, the leader of The Dawn Council, and we each introduced
		 ourselves to him in turn.
		-We were then introduced to a variety of wealthy and powerful folks, their faces and names
		 soon a blur.
			-Among them were:
			 Quim - Wine, Thoreous - Waste disposal,  Otso - Woodworker's Guild, Nizol - Fishmonger,
			 Dranthus - Miner's Guild
		-I eventually made a very successful speech, during which Isaias took the opportunity of to
		 cast some kind of spell (he'd requested a distraction from me).
		-In small chit chat thereafter, I did hear rumors of possible work.
			-One man mention that the Miner's Guild was always looking for muscle, and another, one
			 of the nobility, even mentioned he'd love to hire me as the family's envoy.
				-"Well, I am a hit at parties!"
		-Forcas seemed to get angrier and angrier throughout the party, and eventually began
		 scornfully ranting about "the decadence of these so-called nobles."
			-Several of us bluffed our way through calming that situation:
			 "Forcas, your impression is dead on! Isn't he a hoot?"
			-Situation defused.
		-We also met one Maya Dracus, who seemed quite fascinated by us.
			-She was a scion of one of the city's noble houses.
			-House Dracus was an old one, but one which had recently required some ill repute.
			-Oddly, she also asked us about The Morticians' Guild.
				-Ugh. Not a crowd I want anything to do with.
		-A priest of Tyr also really wanted us to come to a service.
			-Pass.
			-He and Forcas started arguing theology.
		-Finally, it was time for the ceremony itself and, after some speechifying by Xavius, we
		 were given medals marked with the spire of Sasserine, designating us honorary delegates of
		 The Dawn Council.
			-It gives +2 circumstance to Diplomacy and Gather Information in Sasserine, but that
			 overlaps with me Marshal bonus, so only really useful for the others, and only when I'm
			 not around.
	-Afterwards, it was afterparty time!
		-After some amount of badgering from me, we led a trail of minor nobility and assorted
		 hangers-on back to Lady Lavinia's estate.
		-Partying ensued.
		-I danced with Lady Lavinia.
		-We also heard more from Maya Dracus, who had followed us to the after party.
			-She wanted to talk more about The Morticians' Guild, claiming there'd been all too few
			 funerals lately. She believed that the bodies were instead being used in dark rituals
			 of some form.
			-She also mentioned that there was a brisk trade in dragon bones lately, which she
			 thought may be ending up in similar rituals.
			-Finally, and the carrot to all this, she thinks they might have had dealings with The
			 Lotus Dragons, and that Vanthus could be hiding with them.
				-_That_ caught my attention. Still want to stab that prick.
	-We were amenable to Maya's deal, her assistance in finding Vanthus in exchange for ours in
	 finding out what's going on with The Guild.
		-We'll start that investigation next session.


5/18/22:
	-We debated how to go about investigating these corrupt cadaver cosmeticians.
		-My idea to drink until someone passes out, and then pass them off as a corpse yielded
		 stares, rather than the expected standing ovation.
		-Maya wasn't willing to disclose her source for these rumors of corruption, but says she
		 trusts them.
			-"Hush-hush then. I see."
	-We decided to disguise Jade as a corpse.
		-I wasn't too sure of the plan here, but it seemed like fun, and Jade was willing. Why
		 the hell not?
		-Did the make up, and did a pretty decent job of it, if I do say so myself.
		-To complete the job, we went to see an alchemist.
			-"Say there, shopkeep, got a potion with which I could fake my own death?"
			 "Why would you want that?"
			 ". . . a surprise party."
			 "That'll be quite the suprise. . ."
			 "Yeah. I can't wait to see the look on Mom's face."
		-We got something that should convincingly paralyze Jade for an hour, an inky black potion.
	-In the course of that, I got a message from Forcas, who'd been watching outside The Morticians'
	 Guild.
		-Apparently people just deliver notes to the guild, indicating where the body is to be found.
		-However, no one seems to leave the guild, not while Forcas was there, and not in days, from
		 what the people he asked said.
		-In return for the delivered message, I bought the urchin that brought it lunch in the nearest
		 tavern.
		-I spent the next three hours there, eating and drinking, but eventually went to find Forcas.
	-On the way to see Forcas, we spotted a 3 ft. long rat in an alley we passed, though it skittered
	 off when we saw it looking at us.
		-Maya said such things aren't exactly indigenous to the city, but that a gang known as The
		 Shapers is rumored to have were-rats among them.
	-When we got to The Morticians' Guild, Forcas was nowhere to be seen.
		-We asked some likely looking homeless men (his crowd) if they'd seen him, and we were told
		 that he had descended into some kind of catacombs.
		-Waiting around an hour or so, Forcas and the man who apparently led him down there, one
		 Josias, came walking back over.
		-Forcas sent Josias off, and then bade us follow him.
			-He asked me for some booze as he went. I shrugged and handed him my half drank road beer.
		-As we walked, Forcas talked.
			-Josias was a apparently once a member of the guild, but it had turned dark after some
			 kind of scaled humanoids started hanging around. An ogre corpse was stolen, and many
			 members were driven off.
				-Their scales apparently came in varied colors, red, white or black. That, to Maya,
				 perhaps said Tiamat and her cult, a god the Bahamut-following noblewoman was none
				 too fond of.
			-Josias also told him how the guild moves around: through the city's catacombs.
				-Apparently there's a locked iron grate leading to the guild down there.
			-While walking, Jade also thought she saw something. . . whiskered, watching us from a
			 rooftop above.
				-She called our attention to it, and Forcas flared bright, but there was nothing up
				 there when we all looked.
		-Forcas led us into the catacombs through a nearby tunnel entrance, it's door wrenched open
		 long ago.
			-Inside, a short distance from the entrance, was the door Forcas had described.
			-I got out my lock picks, but Maya pulled me back, saying she saw a magical aura on the
			 door.
			-After examining it, Jade said it looked like a casting of Arcane Lock.
			-Best we could come up with was buying a scroll of Knock, which Isaias and I went off in
			 search of while the others opted to loiter in a catacomb.
			-With this damned rat-thing lurking about, we opted to move quietly.
			-It was late, but a creepy novelty shop was still opened, and a man with obviously fake
			 vampire teeth got us sorted.
			-Returning in a similarly stealthy fashion, we came upon a melee back at the catacomb
			 entrance.
				-The others were fighting a pair of were-rats and a were-tiger!
				-They were faring poorly, wounds dripping blood, though the tiger was wounded as
				 well.
				-Isaias and I each took careful aim and shot at the tiger, but the arrows soon
				 embedded in him barely seemed to slow him, though it got one of his rat buddies
				 shooting me as I ducked behind a barrel.
				-Two more swipes from the tiger and suddenly Forcas and Maya were on the ground and
				 out of my sight.
				-I tried to kill the were-tiger with my brain and met with some success, but he
				 proved hard headed, and was soon running my way.
				-He managed to catch me, leaping down from a rooftop to give me a nasty scratch,
				 one the soon had me feeling queasy.
				-Fortunately, Forcas began bellowing insults at the beast and I summersaulted back,
				 ducking, turned a corner down an alley, and hid again behind a barrel.
					-Someone must have gotten him back on his feet, and not a moment too soon!
				-The tiger-man ran down the alley past me, thankfully not noticing me (and I was not
				 keen to remind him with an attack of opportunity), and engaged Forcas in melee.
				-I ducked from cover to cover, loosing arrows at the beast, while others joined
				 Forcas in the fray.
				-Sadly, though, Forcas soon lay unmoving at the monster's feet, after a particular
				 grevious swipe nearly severed his arm at the shoulder.
				-Someone out of my sight threw a dagger at the tiger's face and it staggered away
				 from the melee, trying to pull the dagger from it's eye while I loosed another
				 arrow at it and Isaias gave chase.
				-Isaias chased it down a cross street, and I then heard a great thud.
				-I cautiously crept forward, and, rounding the corner, was disappointed to see a 
				 bare-chested _man_ in the torn pants that once wrapped the tiger-beast.
					-Aww. I was was hoping for a rug. . .
				-Oh! I then ran over to check on Forcas, as Isaias called after me, saying, "I saw
				 the light leave his eyes, Fred. . ."
					-As I pulled my hands from Forcas's pockets, I said to our sad and wounded
					 group, ". . . I think I'll miss Forcas most of all, out of my various lost
					 comrades. *sniff* The other's left me so much more to remember them by. . .
					 Well! At least he'll aid us once more even in death: we now have a good reason
					 to talk to The Morticians' Guild!"


TODO:
	-I, and a couple of others, may be cursed. We should probably look into that.
		-Or just embrace being a weretiger?
			-https://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/lycanthrope.htm
			-Shit. It would be a sudden and very different direction for the character, but not that
			 bad. . .
				-+2 LA and 6 racial HD, but the latter are much better than usual due to Phrenic.
					-Reducing LA would come into play when you're level 12: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/races/reducingLevelAdjustments.htm
					-What are the racial HD?
						-Animal? https://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#animalType
							-Yeah, "Lycanthropes As Characters" confirms as much.
						-Skills:
							-Skill points: 6*(2+3+1) = 36
							-Class skills: Balance, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, Swim
								-+6 Hide, +6 Move Silently, +2 (4 pts.) Perform (dance), Social?
							-That is pretty crippling, unless you want to just go into being a melee
							 rogue.
				-Would probably mean no Dread Pirate, but Shadowdancer could be your next class level.
					-Next levels:
						10	Shadowdancer 1
						11	Shadowdancer 2
						12	Rogue 3
					-Still, you'd have an underpowered sneak attack and only 3 attacks in a charge,
					 since Rake kicks in the _next_ turn (4 claws on that following turn).
				-Would mean no leadership until late, due to 6 _class_ levels required, and a poor
				 cohort when you get it.
				-Ah, no pounce, grab, or rake in hybrid form.
					-Maybe not a good idea, unless you can be a talking tiger.
			-Would have a weird impact on the game, since you'd suddenly have 9 HD, as well as a +2 LA.
			-It actually makes a lot of flavor-sense. Fred's bitterness over not getting to be an
			 Elan, his conviction he's already a better-than-normal freak, etc.
			-Hmm. . . can always become a tiger _later_. . .
	-Forcas's body?
		-Forment a riot against the Shaper gang that killed him?
			-Real Mark Antony vibes. . .
			-Make a martyred saint of him. They actually attacked him _while he prayed_.
		-Use it for Morticians' Guild shenanigans?
		-Both?


6/1/22:
	-Isaias is apparently well versed in medicine, and explain to us what those of us feeling
	 feverish likely caught: lycanthropy.
		-He explained that the easiest way to deal with it will likely to very quickly obtain some
		 wolfsbane.
		-Maya knew an apothecary that could likely help, The Wildwood Apothecary, over by the arena.
	-There was also the matter of Forcas's body. . .
		-I've got plans for it. . . funeral plans. So we need to hang onto that.
		-Maya mentioned a temple to Wee Jas that the moritician's guild had supplanted, and I also
		 threw out the idea of paying some of the street people to hide it for us.
	-Maya went to go arrange passage on boat, recognizing the house symbol marking one nearby.
		-She made some kind of arrangement with them, trading our eventual help with some problem
		 impacting the harbor.
	-With that set, we then took Forcas to his nearby soup kitchen.
		-They were a bit skeptical of hosting the body in an eatery, but we convinced them.
		-They were suitably agrieved by his loss.
	-That matter settled, we boarded the boat, and made our way towards the arena district.
	-There was some trouble with an overly officious guard at the gate of the district, but Maya
	 sorted that with in typical noble fashion, something that boiled down to, "Do you know who I
	 am?"
	-We found the apothecary and, with both some coin and help looking, we eventually found some
	 wolf's bane in the proprietor's overcrowded storeroom.
		-She also questioned us about why we needed such a thing and we recounted our run in with
		 the Shaper gang.
		-She was familiar with them, and even lamented their take over of some scrublands near the
		 old observatory. She used to gather herbs there, but they now let no one near.
	-We then debated what to do about the late Forcas.
		-Maya thought that, in light of Forcas (and several of the rest of us) having been recently
		 named a "Hero of the City", she could persuade the city's government to facilitate a grand
		 funeral.
	-We were pretty beat up, though, from the tiger fight, and opted to find rest first.
		-We returned to the Vanderborn estate, to rest there.
		-Lady Vanderborn was suitable aggrieved to learn of Forcas's death, and seemed to be
		 developing some doubts about this whole adventurers enterprise, but she also furnish us
		 with some healing potions, to see to our wounds.
	-We returned the following day to the soup kitchen, to see to Forcas's body.
		-It was crowded, and several of my companions stepped in to help distribute food.
		-Standing over the body, though, was a strange looking figure. Emaciated, and dressed in
		 rustic clothing, we asked him if he knew Forcas.
		-"As an easy meal, no more. He was a good person, though, and could have helped the city
		 much."
		-He introduced himself as "Nkondi the Hunter", and he seemed to know much about The
		 Morticians' Guild, saying they had "abandoned the teachings of the founder" and that "they
		 collect the dead for no holy purpose, but for their own purposes".
		-He also had a disturbing habit of talking to his "ancestors".
		-Isaias asked him if he was a follower of Nkisi, a name Nkondi seemed to know. He responded
		 that he was indeed "named for one of the ancestors".
		-There was then a commotion at the door. Robed figures had entered, announcing, "We have
		 come for the body."
		-Maya told them off, but they said they'd return soon.
			-Nkondi claimed they would come with reinforcements.
		-We decided to get Forcas out of there.
	-At Isaias's prompting, we took him to a temple of Shawn, near the arena.
		-We hired a chatty coachman, Havy, who thankfully bought the story that Forcas was drunk.
		-As we pulled up outside the cathedral, I stared a bit at the carvings on the outside while
		 Maya paid the coachman.
			-"Isaias, who did you say this was a temple to again?"
			 "To Shawn, of The Brotherhood."
			 "Ahhh. Um, I might sit this next bit out, go see what's going on at the arena. Meet me
			  over there?"
			 "Uh, sure?"
			 "Great! I'll save you all some seats!"
	-I wandered over to the arena, grabbed a beer, and found a seat in the stands.
		-The weather was good, the beer cheap, and the fights, if a bit uninventive, were decent 
		 entertainment.
		-As a watched, I caught a strange looking stranger eying me.
			-He had a green-ish cast to his skin, and fingers far longer than most humanoids.
		-Being a friendly sort, I raised my mug to him, in toast.
		-In response, he said, "Your mind. . . it is not normal, is it?"
		 "Eh, what's normal? I do like to think of myself as rather sharp, though."
		 "I mean that you have the mark of oppression on you. I have felt similar, for my people
		  were once enslaved by the mindflayers."
		 "Ah, I know what you mean. The one who. . . made me even has friends in this city. It's
		  why I'm here, avoiding them."
		 "I'm here because I would see these barbaric fights stopped. They remind me all too much
		  of the. . . entertainments that my people were once forced to participate in."
		 "I see, I see. Well, best of luck to you in that endeavor!"
		 "And to you in yours. I am called Gith. What is your name?"
		 "Fredrick, called Fred the Red."
		 "Well met, Fred. I will leave you to the. . . games."
	-I was eventually collected by the rest of the party, and we discussed what to do next.
		-They're amenable to my goal of riling up the people against the Shaper Gang, so we went
		 with Maya to talk with the city's government about a state funeral.
		-Lady Vanderborn's letters had already kicked off the process of gathering a quorum of The
		 Dawn Council, and they'd nearly all gathered already by the time that we arrived.
		-They were amenable to providing Forcas a hero's funeral, one lasting from dawn to dusk as
		 is the custom.
		-I asked if there would be an opportunity for me to speak, a eulogy, and they said I could
		 do so in the evening, in front of the court house.
	-We then retired to the Vanderborn estate, all save Nkondi, who stood watch over Forcas's body
	 at the temple.
		-Before we made it to bed, though, a cleric of Shawn arrived at the estate, out of breath,
		 reporting another attempt by The Morticians' Guild to claim the body, though they were
		 still dissuaded with words alone.
		-We returned with him to the temple, and opted to sleep there that night, in case they
		 return.
		-The next morning, I went out for both some breakfast and some rumors, curious about what
		 The Morticians' Guild might attempt.
			-Jade joined me in that, and we came back with reports of one of their robed figures
			 lugging around a large sack, from which emerged a wing (?).
			-Maya _had_ said something about suspecting the guid of trying to raise undead dragons. . .
		-When we came back with that, Maya suggested a potential shield, human and reputational.
		-We arranged a short notice wake/party before the temple, gather all we could with free
		 food and booze plus Maya's connections among the nobles.
			-Quite a crowd gathered and we regaled them with mostly true stories of Forcas's life.
			-It was quite the party, but it did not dissuade those killjoys in The Morticians' Guild.
			-The first sign of that was Jade shouting, "Look!" and pointing at the sky.
			-Circling above, there was indeed a winged shape that, as is swooped down, resolved into
			 a large, undead dragon. What scales it retained were white.
			-We did fierce battle with the creature. It could have gone either way but, after a few
			 moments, a cleric ran out of the nearby temple shouting that help was one the way.
			-The beast then lept into the air, and fled.


TODO:
	-(Done!) Level up!


6/29/22:
	-The beast driven off, the clerics of the temple rushed over to us, tending to our wounds.
	-They asked us if we knew who had attacked the wake, and I leveled the charge at The Morticians'
	 Guild, based on the rumored sack of winged thing Jade and I had heard they were hauling around
	 the streets earlier.
	-We still had three hours still until the official funeral was scheduled, so I figured I'd do
	 what I could to encourage people to return to the wake, and eventually join us for the procession.
		-I reassured those still hiding in the area that the dragon was gone, and encouraged them to
		 return, "To show those corpse-humping necromancers that you're not afraid!"
		-I then turned to the nearby taverns, to rally still more.
		-When I had returned to the temple-front wake, I found that Maya was gone. The others said
		 she'd been called away by a messenger from her family.
	-Eventually, it came time for the processional. A wagon drawn by fine white horses and bedecked
	 in flowers in the shape of an angel came to collect Forcas's body.
	-We and the crowd at the wake followed it, in a raucous mob, gathering still more people as we
	 walked.
	-Eventually, we arrived at the formal headquarters of The Dawn Council and the funeral began,
	 with Forcas lying in state.
		-It opened with a lengthy set of speeches by The Dawn Council's various politicians and
		 noteables, each transparently seeking to use Forcas to promote their own various agendas.
		-Nkondi and I spend much of that time riling up whatever portion of the crowd was in earshot
		 of us, calling for action and disparaging the timid investigations and panels a few of the
		 speaking council members made.
		-Finally, it came time for my speech.
			-I first spoke of Forcas's love for the city and it's people, saying how much it would
			 have meant to have this crowd here, and exhorting them to drag to the funeral any who
			 aren't already.
			-I then spoke of how Forcas died. How, while serving the people of this city, while
			 kneeling in _prayer_ on Sasserine's streets, he was cut down by a monstrous beast
			 dwelling among them. "Will you let this stand?" I asked.
			-At this point, a member of the council started trying to stop me, calling for the
			 guards to get me out of there, and saying it was time for his speech.
				-Isaias intervened, though, standing between us and talking to him, buying me time.
			-While that was going on, I stared at something in my hands for a moment, eventually
			 lifting it to show the crowd the bloody rag Forcas had been wearing when he was cut
			 down.
				-"This rag is what Forcas wore when the beast slew him! How," I shouted, throwing
				 the bloody rag into the crown, "Are you going to answer the spilled blood of a
				 saint?!?"
				-The crowd drew back as it fell, then rushed forward, staring reverently at it on
				 the ground.
				-Nkondi eventually collected it, affixing it to a pole as a makeshift standard.
			-I then began rallying them against The Shapers and The Morticians' Guild, speaking of
			 "the vile, twisted beasts, this Shaper gang, living among you" and "the foul corruption
			 of their corpse-stealing allies in The Morticians' Guild". As more and more improvised
			 clubs and torches began to appear, I told them, "We need to drive out this corruption,
			 with Forcas's holy, cleansing light!"
	-We then set the cart bearing Forcas's body alight ("They won't get _this_ body!") and,
	 with it in tow and Nkondi holding our bloody standard aloft, we lead the crowd towards
	 the nearest Morticians' guildhouse.
		-The door was elaborately locked, but that's no barrier to a mob. "Find a ram!" I called out.
		-Nkondi guided a group to a nearby statue that was toppled to serve the purpose.
		-As the were bringing it up, though, the zombie dragon returned, alighting on the roof of
		 The Morticians' Guild and roaring, scattering much of the crowd.
		-The beast wasted no time spraying my fellows with it's freezing breath, but I was
		 fortunately quicker, and already hiding behind a statue after taking a running pot shot at
		 it with my wand.
		-I continued sniping the beast while my comrades engaged in melee.
		-It knocked Isaias to the ground where he lay unmoving, but a blow from Jade felled the
		 creature.
	-While Jade saw to Isaias's wounds, getting him back on his feet, I ran off in search of the
	 scattered crowd.
		-"The dragon is gone!" I told them. "Can there be any doubt now that it was The Morticians
		 who attacked Forcas's wake?!? The very same beast guards their guildhouse! Show them
		 Forcas's light! Bring those torches!"
	-By the time I returned with a mob at my back, Isaias was back up, blade in hand, and the door to
	 the guildhouse was open. Jade was talking with someone in the darkness within.
	-She turned and began to say something to the rest of the party, but I was busy shouting
	 incitements at the mob.
	-The crowd was soon surging forward, setting the outside of the building alight as they threw
	 rocks and jars of lamp oil through the building's windows.
	-The guildhouse was soon a towering inferno, and the mob was looking for more targets.
	-Nkondi raised the matter of the catacombs, the ones we'd been investigating when Forcas died,
	 and we led the mob, bearing the statue-ram, to that door.
		-The door was fortified with spells, and the ram did no real damage to it, but we still had
		 the Knock scroll we'd purchased for just this.
		-I encouraged the crowd to step back and called Jade forward. "How are you with scrolls? I
		 can't read this shit but can probably make this work. Seems more like your kind of thing,
		 though."
		-She was confident of her skills, took the scroll, and soon had the door open.
		-We and the mob then streamed inside, with me shouting, "Come! Bring the light of Forcas to
		 these tunnels, and drive these necromancers from their holes!"
		-We found ourselves in a series of catacombs, as expected, with many of the tombs apparently
		 having been ransacked.
		-Surging forward with the crowd, we were met in an interior chamber by a booming voice, an
		 ogre shouting, "Come at me!"
		-Rather than oblige him, I stared him down, _really_ hard, manifesting Mind Thrust, and he
		 reeled, clutching his head. I immediately ducked behind some handy cover, hiding in the
		 shadows there.
		-Isaias rushed forward to engage the ogre, as some robed figures rushed up to it's aid, from
		 behind the creature, casting spells upon it.
		-Jade joined in the attack as well, with her bow, while Nkondi cast spells.
		-I leaned out of my cover, taking careful aim with my bow, and shot one of the robed
		 necromancers _right in her fucking face_.
		-Unfortunately the ogre evened the score by smashing Isaias into the ground with it's club,
		 leaving him an unmoving tangle of broken limbs.
		-Compounding matters, one of the necromancers began chanting and waving, and I soon felt a
		 great weariness coming over me. I powered through it by force of (psionically enhanced)
		 will, but Jade fell to the ground beside me, snoring.
		-The mob, at Nkondi's urging, began to pelt the ogre with improvised incendiaries. Soon, it
		 and it's immediate surroundings were aflame, and the flames rapidly spreading to the
		 surrounding dry debris.
		-The ogre ran, screaming, deeper into the catacombs, and the necromancers followed him in a
		 somewhat more organized retreat.
		-"Nkondi!" I shouted, "Check on Isaias!" Meanwhile, I shook Jade awake.
		-Nkondi looked grim, and began to mutter, saying, "Well, at least they won't have this
		 body. . ."
		-He began to pour lamp oil over Isaias, but I shouted at him, saying, "Stop! Just drag him
		 out of here! There may be something we can still do. . . or something to remember him by."
		-He indeed began to drag, and I soon joined him in a macabre race, dragging the necromancer
		 I downed out of the tunnels too (for clues and profit both!).
		-Once outside the smoke-spewing door of the catacombs, we checked on Isaias, and found he
		 was indeed beyond help.
		-So, we rifled through pockets.
			-The necromancer had unsurprising equipment, the most interesting of which were some
			 scrolls, and also 75 gold. The gold was actually the strangest thing, as the coins were
			 all stamped with the emblem of The Morticians' Guild. . .
			-Digging through Isaias's gear, The Orb of the Brotherhood fell out of a pocket on his
			 backpack, along with a strange iron fork that looks like it would fit in one of
			 the orb's slots.
				-The fork was new to us, and I asked Jade if she knew what it was for.
				-She said she thought it might be a key to one of The Brotherhood's planes, which
				 quickly had me backing away, but she boldly slotted it into the orb.
				-Handling it a moment more, she said she thought that had unlocked some divine
				 power for use by the bearer, but I told her, "You're welcome to keep it, so long
				 as you keep it the hell away from me. . ."
			-Isais also strangely had two holy symbols, both of which I recognized. One was the
			 symbol of the god he professed to follow, Shawn of the Brotherhood, but the other bore
			 the symbol of Enilias, another, sneakier member of The Brotherhood.

			-TEU's seem like a promising unit to look for, for volumes of trade: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105244/monthly-retail-import-volume-us/
				-Formal definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-foot_equivalent_unit
				-From that, it suggests one TEU = 1,172 cu ft.
			-With infinite power points, you can manage to Greater Fabricate:
				100*25/10 = 250 cu ft. / round organic, or (24-8)*60*10*250 = 2,400,000 cu ft. / day
			-So, 2,400,000/1,172 = 2047 TEU / day, or 747,155 TEU / year
				-Small relative to global throughput: https://www.statista.com/statistics/913398/container-throughput-worldwide/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20global%20container%20throughput,compared%20with%20the%20previous%20year.
				-A mere 1.5% of the throughput of Shanghai's port, though that's the busiest in the world: https://www.statista.com/statistics/264171/turnover-volume-of-the-largest-container-ports-worldwide/
				-Still, the above wiki page suggests that's 747,155/11000 = 67.92 huge container ships.
			-Divide by 10 for inorganic.
			-Divine Earth Mastery, though, produces effectively undefined quantities of precious metals
			 in a mere round.
		-Edric's plane:
			-Description from the end of the Xûl-Jarak game:
				-Edric first sought out his kin, the other elans, and the means to make them. Soon he
				 was populating his plane with his immortal kindred, uplifting promising mortals minds.
				-Beneath it's barren outer layer of gates, Edric's nested paradise of the mind urbanized
				 heavily, it's population mostly elans and others naturally psionic. Others found the
				 plane both strange and harsh, with weird customs and expensive imported food.
				-Soon, from his plane, strange crystals grew (a creation of Edric's next epic spell),
				 spreading outward from it's gates, and covering seemingly most surfaces within. It was
				 rumored that Edric could reach anywhere the crystals did (or even that he _was_ the
				 crystals), and also that his power grew as it did.
				-Rovert, his cohort, did not ascend to divinity, as many of the others did. A man well
				 into his middle years by the time he joined his will to Edric's, his body began failing
				 soon into Edric's divine reign. Not entirely human, Edric feared the potential
				 consequnces of attemping to make Rovert an elan, but feared losing his right hand even
				 more, and Rovert was all too willing. The massive slimemold-like creature that grew
				 from his body, with it's alien intelligence, is now the story commonly cited to
				 illustrate the danger of such things.
		-Layers (Outer to inner):
			-The Borderlands:
				-Studded with portals, leading to a variety of destinations.
				-Flat and desert-like.
				-Tribes of Thri-kreen loyal to Edric are the main inhabitants.
				-It's also spanned by a network of canals, used for freight.
			-About 92 layers of air beneath it, each 280' with 280' of earth and stone between each.
				-How many is partly a function of time passed since planar creation.
					-Growth over time defined here: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/genesis.htm
					-So, 180' radius in 180 days, than 1' more per week since.
					-Jake previously mentioned it had been something like 1000 years.
					-So, 180+(365-180)/7+999*365/7 = 52,297'
						-Or, the plane is 9.9 miles in radius. Way more than I thought.
				-How far between each layer?
					-Google says a story is about 14'.
					-Lets say 10 stories of building room on either side, for 20 stories between
					 layers, or 280 ft.
					-Hmm. . . Even with the each layer being that thick itself, that's a _ton_ of
					 layers. 52,297/(280*2) = 93, to be exact.
						-What kind of surface area is that?
							-The Borderlands are 1231 square miles. Bigger than Rhode Island's 1,034,
							 but well under Delaware's (next smallest) 1,955.
							-Total: 4pi*r^2 + 4pi*(r-280)^2 + 4pi*(r-280*2)^2 + . . 
								Sum from 0 to Z of 4pi*(r-280x)^2
								where Z = 52,297/2 (plus or minus one or two)
								In Wolfram: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sum+4pi*%2852297-280k%29%5E2+from+k+%3D+1+to+52%2C297%2F2
							-So, 2.06128301 × 10^11 square miles
								-Surface area of the Earth is 196,900,000 sq. miles.
								-So, that's 1000x the surface of the Earth. . .
								-A thousand Earths, with no point much more than 20 miles away from
								 any other.
			-Edric's Sanctum:
				-This, the site of Edric's ascension, remains a small spherical cavity pierced
				 through innumerable times by enormous crystals. Edric spends most of his here,
				 meditating in the center with the crystals intersecting his form.
		-Inputs (what he trades for or otherwise consumes):
			-Magic, souls, and organics.
		-Outputs (what he produces, for himself and others):
			-Finished goods of extremely high quality.
				-Structures included.
			-All sorts of earths and metals, adamantine in particular.
			-Minds. Often strange, often immortal.
		-Where "he", in the above stuff, refers to not just Edric, but his plane, his worshippers
		 (and more tightly-bound "believers", from thrallherd), and the whole society of people on
		 the plane and linked to it. Edric thinks of all of this as "himself".
	-Once you get Leadership, what cohort should you get?
		-CN Gnome Illusionist?
			-Gnome is definitely solid for an illusionist.
				-+1 to Illusion spell DCs.
				-Alchemy bonus is solid for ships too, furnishing novel alchemical weapons and maybe
				 dovetailing with cannons or more traditional seige weapons.
				-If any gnome, then forest gnome seems a no-brainer. It seemingly only has upsides
				 over the default: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gnomes,_Forest_(Race)
				-Considers himself a "pargon of gnomishness".
			-Sorcerer or wizard?
				-Still Spell, etc.?
				-Charisma also:
					-Is the basis for gnome spell-likes.
					-Helps Disguise, a big-deal skill for illusions (though _you_ also help that a ton).
				-Intelligence also:
					-Helps with alchemy.
				-Variant Illusionist wizards are interesting: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/specialistWizardVariants.htm#chainsofDisbelief
					-Chains of Disbelief is super cool, but maybe actually a downside when working
					 with a ship's crew.
					-Shadow Shaper might be worth the hefty price, given how it dovetails with what
					 you do.
					-Focused Specialist might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#focused-specialist
					-Gnome Illusionist also looks interesting, especially the first two levels:https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#gnome-illusionist
				-Sorcerers have their own variants:
					-This list is super useful: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/variant/variantList.html
					-Illusion Sphere might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#socerer-spheres
					-If religious, there's some fun divine variants:
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#divine-companion
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#domain-access
				-Ah, wizards having Scribe Scroll goes well with your UMD score.
			-Cat familiar's +3 to Move Silently helps someone who casts invisibility, and fits a ship.
			-Interesting applications with ships, especially flying ones.
				-How big can you make illusions? Big enough to hide a ship in a cloud?
					-1st level spell Silent Image is plenty big, with a duration of Concentration!
					-Ah, but can an illusion _follow_ a ship? Silent Image seems to have a static
					 location. _Maybe_ tortured logic would consider a ship a location. . .
			-Illusionist is a great fit for social rogue.
				-Lies + illusions = profit.
				-Invisibility + rogues = death.
				-Eventual Simulacrums are an amazing effect from a cohort: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/simulacrum.htm
	-What about followers?
		-Dread Pirate will double them at it's 10th level.
		-You'll have eight level ones if you take it right at 6th level, even without Charisma buffs.
	-Tiger time? See TODOs before 6/1/22.
