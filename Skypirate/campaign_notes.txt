12/29/21:
	-We're members of a scouting party sent out by The Brotherhood.
		-We were furnished with an airship and sent out to explore The Material, seeking wonders,
		 knowledge, and resources.
		-Larix serves as our helmsman, capable of communicating with the bound air elementals that
		 power the ship.
			-The hull is Edric-built, sailing forth from one of his enormous factory cathedrals, but
			 the service of the elementals was purchased.
			-The "engines" require regular castings of a spell to keep running. A common service, it
			 runs about 50 gp. for our ship, and our engines currently have two weeks of runtime
			 left.
		-Your individual tasking probably resembled this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalndXdxriI
	-After days over the ocean, we came to a kind of port city, newer spires surmounting ancient
	 machinery, and docks below, on the shores of the island this all stands on.
		-Low on supplies, and with Larix assuring us this at least wasn't actively hostile territory,
		 we decided to dock.
		-The city's name proved to be Sasserine.
		-It had recently undergone some kind of change in leadership, "the guilds" having "abandoned
		 the city", with The Dawn Council taking it's place.
			-Indeed, we saw several on the street bearing a sun emblem, along other badges: a
			 lighthouse surrounded by a dragon, a sword with a shield and helmet, a tiger with a
			 rose, and a spider and keep.
		-The city seems to be mostly human.
		-Ruins were frequently in evidence, broken bridges and the like, that seemed to indicate the
		 city had been rebuilt several times.
	-In paying the docking fee, we also heard about a job oppotunity, a lady offering work, and
	 requesting candidates meet her at her estate tomorrow evening.
	-In the meantime, we found a tavern, The Drunken Bear.
		-Talking with the barkeep, we learned more about Lavinia. Apparently she'd lost her family
		 in an airship accident, leaving just her and a sibling.
		-The barkeep also seemed none too fond of The Dawn Council, on account of new taxes.
		-She also told us of the city's seven districts:
			-The Champion District, with the arena and other entertainments.
			-The Merchant District, where we docked and were staying.
			-The Cudgel District.
			-The Sun District.
			-The Noble District.
			-The Azure District.
			-The Shadowshore, the one part of the city where the dawn can't reach. . .
		-We also rented a room there.
	-With time to kill, we also checked out the markets of The Merchant District, finding some
	 decent options for resupplying the ship.
	-Varani kept hiding his face when we passed those bearing the emblem of The Dawn Council.
		-I asked him what the deal was and he said someone he'd "rather not talk about" had paid
		 them to capture him.
	-We spent the night at The Drunken Bear.
		-During the early hours of the morning, Varani heard me mumbling in my sleep: "No! No more
		 ink blots. . ."
	-When we woke, Varani was gone.
		-Asking the barkeep, she left about two hours before I came down, and outside there was a
		 lot more Council activity. . .
		-Once Larix woke too, though, he consulted his hawk, who led us to a dead-end alley, and
		 Varani then descended from a hiding place atop some crates and beneath the eaves of a
		 building.
		-Apparently The Dawn Council is looking for her in force, hand she was unable to get back
		 to the bar after going for a run.
	-We decided to find a way to The Shadowshore, and lie low until our dinner tonight.
	-After some quick patches to an abandoned skiff, we took to the water, to cross the lagoon,
	 but opted instead to stop on a deserted, brush-and-trash-strewn island. It seemed a good 
	 hiding spot.
		-Not entirely deserted, as it turned out. I heard the sound of some voices speaking in
		 Goblin somewhere nearby.
		-I crept over and listened in. It seemed they were a party of scrappers, arguing over salvage.
		-Goblins seem generally _tolerated_, if looked down upon, so I decided we should leave them be.
		-There's bigger fish in the water tonight, and no sense showing up to a lady's house smelling
		 like we'd been rolling around in trash with goblins.
	-As the time came, we headed to our dinner.
		-After knocking, we were ushered inside.
		-A party of armored folks were exiting as we entered. Apparently Lady Lavinia has other
		 suitors. . .
			-Varani knew them as a group of mercenaries, "The Jade Ravens".
			-They were talking about being sent to the city of Cauldron, to the South.
		-As we spoke with Lady Lavinia, she spoke of money troubles, a vault beneath a castle, and
		 the two signet rings that can open the vault. Her father's is the only one available, but
		 it's aboard an impounded ship.
			-She paid the fine, but the man holding the ship claims to have never received it, and
			 she suspects he's up to something, aboard the ship.
				-Soller Vark is his name, and she suspects him of being a smuggler.
			-She asks that we recover her money, and, if possible, find out what he's doing aboard
			 the ship.
				-I haggled for 250 gp. in exchange for the task and she directed us to the ship.
	-Heading there, the ship proved not to be docked, but moored some distance out form the peer.
	-We opted to pretend to fish on our skiff, and keep an eye on ship until midnight at least.
		-No one came or went, and the deck was deserted save a sentry that came out from time to
		 time, but animal noises came from within the hold.
		-We tried climbing the anchor chain, but it. . . did not go well. I was able to play off the
		 noise as a drunk Varani falling while fishing, but we then had to row out of there as the
		 sentry shoed us off.
		-We opted to return another night.


1/12/22:
	-Returning to our own ship to spend the night, given the goons looking for Varani near the inn,
	 we debated our strategy.
	-We didn't come up with anything better, though, and Varani claims she's not normally that clumsy,
	 so we opted to keep watch over the ship for another day, and attempt boarding again after
	 nightfall if we don't catch someone leaving the ship.
	-A little while into the morning, we boarded our skiff and headed out onto the bay to watch the
	 ship.
		-Near nightfall, the ship headed in toward the dock it had been tied to, some distance out.
		-We followed, and as we neared the ship, we could hear them shouting about making the ship
		 ready for departure.
		-We beached the skiff and hurried towards the dock, Larix employing his shapechanger
		 heritage to disguise him as one of the crew.
			-Ducking behind a crate, he tried to hide to cast a spell, summoning a mist to give the
			 rest of us some cover.
			-He was caught in that, but his disguise worked, and he was shoed aboard the departing
			 ship.
		-Varani then tried playing it cool, carrying a random crate aboard, while I crouched behind
		 one still on the docks.
		-Didn't go too well, though. A sentry questioned her, and she then dropped the crate and ran
		 aboard.
		-Well, there's my distraction, so I attempted to sneak aboard myself.
		-Varani threw a punch at one of the thugs, and a brawl ensued.
		-Larix tried his spell again, calling up the mist, but at least one of the sentries began
		 pointing and shouting at him as he did so.
		-With the shit kicking off, I ran into the now-present fog, towards someone shouting from
		 the upper deck on one end of the ship.
			-Hmm. . . I may lie to the lady about what went down here. "Some fight with criminal
			 rivals, no doubt. . ."
		-Hearing some commotion nearby, I crept up on someone stomping around in the fog, only to
		 trip over a length of rope abandoned on deck. Someone began shouting at me to keep back,
		 so I stabbed into the fog with my rapier, but didn't connect with anything.
		-Things went pretty far South. After another vain fog-stabbing, and a legit me-stabbing, I
		 ran the fuck away, back onto the dock and ducking behind a crate..
		-These aren't good odds. I figured I might be able to buy some time, though, and set about
		 sabatoging the ramp running from ship to dock, wedging a stake found into the dock into the
		 rotating mechanism it was locked into. Now, as the ship moved with the waves, it squeals,
		 and probably won't be easily undone.
		-I then made my way towards the seaward end of the ship, where the anchor chain and the
		 docking rope were, aiming to sabatoge those too.
			-I had to take it slow, though, darting from cover to cover, having seen thugs
			 brandishing crossbows on the ship.
		-Meanwhile, the commotion in the fog seemed to intensify. There was some kind of metalic-
		 sounding shrieking, as if from something breaking, and then running and thuds.
		-I got to the anchor and, seeing the quick-release lever for it's winch, leaned over onto
		 the ship, and pulled it, dropping the anchor. I then darted back, further down the dock,
		 and behind some crates.
		-Now there were _screams_ coming from the ship, and someone yelling, "It's free! It's free!
		 Abandon ship!"
		-In short order, one of the sailors ran down the ramp and onto the dock. Another even lept
		 down from the poop deck, but landed badly and wasn't moving.
		-I sheathed my rapier and then ran up to the one by the ramp, shouting, "I heard the
		 commotion! What's going on here? Do you need help?"
			-He responded with jumbled, panicked shouting, saying something about "the fog" and "It's
			 loose!"
			 "What's loose?!?"
			 "Fuckin' spider thing!"
		-More crew fled the ship, and eventually the fog cleared, revealing Larix and a horrible
		 spider-thing, with waving. . . tendrils.
		-The monster didn't seem hostile towards Larix, though, exhibiting a kind of deference to
		 him as he spoke to it in a language I did not understand.
		-This chaos had caught the attention of a couple of guards, who were running towards the
		 monster (and visibly pissing it off).
		-I rushed to intervene, shouting, "Guards! These men have been smuggling monsters into the
		 city, aboard their hired ship! My friend has control over it for the moment, but you must
		 apprehend them!"
		-They seemed to buy it, and Larix tried to convince them to back off, that he had it under
		 control, but they instead shouted something about putting it out to sea, and tried to undo
		 the ramp (that I sabotaged).
		-That pissed the spider-thing right off, though, them approaching. Larix tried to calm it,
		 but to no avail, and it grabbed the guards with it's tendrils, and shook them to death.
		-It then looked over back at Larix, like a dog proud of the bird it caught as the limp
		 guards dangled from it's tendrils.
		-Larix asked that I help him get one of the ship's boats overboard. I lowerd it with it's
		 winch, and then he coaxed the beast overboard, and into it, rowing out into the bay.
			-While doing it, I asked him where Varani was, and he said he saw her breath her last.
		-Meanwhile, we saw some further off guards aprehend Soller, at least, and a few of his men.
		 With the boat in the water, I went over to tell our story.
			-As I approached, Soller was receiving some rough treatment. It seems he was known to
			 them, as one said to another, "This thug has been evading us for a long time. He's off
			 to the dungeons."
				-Another also mentioned something about having aprehended about half of the men they
				 saw fleeing.
			-I volunteered that we were here as agents of the ships owner, having heard unsavory
			 things about what was going on aboard. We were here to investigate, having boarded the
			 ship only to hear shouting and chaos from below, apparently their smuggled monster
			 getting loose.
				-They were willing to accept that, and to let us take control of the ship. I didn't
				 mention the owners name, but the guards did ask _my_ name. To proud to do otherwise,
				 I told them Fredrick had this under control, and that I'd let the ships owner know
				 her property had been secured.
		-A short while later Larix returned, wounded, but saying the monster was now free and outside
		 of the city.
		-I let him know we'd met with great success. He agreed, stating he had the ring and a pouch
		 of coin too. The ring had a strange note tucked inside it.
		- searched the ship while he kept watch.
		-I then went in search of a runner, and paid him to go fetch Lady Lavinia.
		-A short while later, she indeed arrived, at the center of a party of hired guards.
			-One of those guards stood out, with spiked hair and wearing flowing robes.
				-We later learned his name was Forcas (Lesley's new character).
			-I called down to her, saying that we'd recovered the ring, fee, and boat all!
			-She was elated, though I also had to add that it was not without cost, as Varani did
			 not make it.
				-"We'll of course need to take her share to her family," I bluffed, to which the
				 lady agreed.
	-She had her guards take control of the ship, and asked us to join her in her hired carriage, 
	 where she spoke of further work, on retainer.
	-First, though, she wished us to come with her to her family's vault, in the city's fortress,
	 which the signet ring is key to.
		-To collect our pay, she said, though she also mentioned the vaults had some kind of
		 security, and that she'd like "seasoned adventurers" with her.
	-We traveled a mile or so across the city, and then took a ferry to the fortress's island.
		-It was a looming, forboding thing.
		-We unlocked her family vault, and it would see her fears were not unwarranted as some kind
		 of metallic cobra slithered out from the shadows within.
		-Forcas quickly lept at it, pummeling it with his fists and elbows.
		-I, meanwhile, stepped back, in front of the lady, and manifested my Force Screen.
		-We then took turns failing to harm it, while Larix summoned a wolf.
		-Larix eventually noticed it was lunging at everyone _but_ Lavinia. He pointed out as much,
		 suggesting it was another thing keyed to the ring.
		-She brandished the ring, and it soon backed off, slithering into some kind of hole.
		-Venturing into the next room, it was covered in various panels depicting different monsters
		 in threatening poses.
			-None matching the ones on the note, though. Hmm. . .
			-In the center, a piller stood, with a star emblem around it's top with one marked spike.
			 It was possible to rotate it, pointing the marked spike at the different images.
			-They _did_ each have a different number of eyes, though, I noticed. Once I pointed that
			 out, we turned the pillar to point to one eye, two eyes, etc., until, with the last,
			 the panels opened, revealing a vault behind each.
			-Most were empty of all but a few scattered coppers on the floor, but one contained
			 several still-full chests, and a bunch of paperwork.
			-We were paid out from that.
				-500 gp. to Larix and I (two shares each, due to Varani's share and Forcas's asceticism).


TODO:
	-(DONE) Level up to 2!
	-Write up the loot in some fashion.
		-Figure out the Fantasy Grounds party sheet inventory?
			-Varani's loot is in there.
		-Or just do another spreadsheet?
			-Yeah, we decided to just to that, as only the DM seems to be able to do much with the
			 Party Sheet thing.
			-You and Joe recorded all cash already, but sort out:			
				3    Elixer of Swimming
				3    Leather Armor
				3    Buckler
				3    Rapier
				3    Light Crossbow
				12    Trail Rations
				Varani's stuff (see party sheet, gold there already split)
		-You probably want to use some of that gear too.
			-Buckler?
			-Consumables?
			


TODO:
	-More dance numbers.
	-Once you get Leadership, what cohort should you get?
		-CN Gnome Illusionist?
			-Gnome is definitely solid for an illusionist.
				-+1 to Illusion spell DCs.
				-Alchemy bonus is solid for ships too, furnishing novel alchemical weapons and maybe
				 dovetailing with cannons or more traditional seige weapons.
				-If any gnome, then forest gnome seems a no-brainer. It seemingly only has upsides
				 over the default: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Gnomes,_Forest_(Race)
				-Considers himself a "pargon of gnomishness".
			-Sorcerer or wizard?
				-Still Spell, etc.?
				-Charisma also:
					-Is the basis for gnome spell-likes.
					-Helps Disguise, a big-deal skill for illusions (though _you_ also help that a ton).
				-Intelligence also:
					-Helps with alchemy.
				-Variant Illusionist wizards are interesting: http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/specialistWizardVariants.htm#chainsofDisbelief
					-Chains of Disbelief is super cool, but maybe actually a downside when working
					 with a ship's crew.
					-Shadow Shaper might be worth the hefty price, given how it dovetails with what
					 you do.
					-Focused Specialist might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#focused-specialist
					-Gnome Illusionist also looks interesting, especially the first two levels:https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/wizard.html#gnome-illusionist
				-Sorcerers have their own variants:
					-This list is super useful: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/variant/variantList.html
					-Illusion Sphere might be worth it: https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#socerer-spheres
					-If religious, there's some fun divine variants:
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#divine-companion
						https://srd.dndtools.org/srd/classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html#domain-access
				-Ah, wizards having Scribe Scroll goes well with your UMD score.
			-Cat familiar's +3 to Move Silently helps someone who casts invisibility, and fits a ship.
			-Interesting applications with ships, especially flying ones.
				-How big can you make illusions? Big enough to hide a ship in a cloud?
					-1st level spell Silent Image is plenty big, with a duration of Concentration!
					-Ah, but can an illusion _follow_ a ship? Silent Image seems to have a static
					 location. _Maybe_ tortured logic would consider a ship a location. . .
			-Illusionist is a great fit for social rogue.
				-Lies + illusions = profit.
				-Invisibility + rogues = death.
				-Eventual Simulacrums are an amazing effect form a cohort: https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/simulacrum.htm
