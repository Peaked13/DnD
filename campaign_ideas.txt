-Dwarven bank:
	-Starting a dwarven bank, run by an NPC (or even an player?!?), with the party dealing with
	 problems that arise.
		-Probably would want to aim for an all (or mostly) dwarf party.
	-Set it with banking as a novel concept, mirroring actual historical origins of the practice,
	 and borrowing heavily from real history.
	-"It's a queer idea, this business, but it seems to turn up even more gold than digging."
	-Was listening to Wind Rose when coming up with this, and should totally use it as a soundtrack.
		-And reading about banking regulation, lol: https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debanking-and-debunking/
